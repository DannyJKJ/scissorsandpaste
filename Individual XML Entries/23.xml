                <p>By a gentleman who arrived in this city on <lb/>Friday last from the county of
                    Ontario in the <lb/>Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this
                    <lb/>state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we <lb/>are informed, that four
                    days before he left that <lb/>county, Colonel Brant from Niagara, at the
                    <lb/>head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal <lb/>Sachems, and other
                    Indians of the Six Nations, <lb/>had arrived at Conadoque, the seat of Oliver
                    <lb/>Phelps, Esq; on a visit of friendship, and at the <lb/>same time to receive
                    the money due them for the <lb/>lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and
                    <lb/>Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps <lb/>and the principal
                    inhabitants of Conadoque, four <lb/>miles from that place, and conducted into
                    town <lb/>–That they were highly gratified with the treat<lb break="no"/>ment they received, and with the manner in which <lb/>they had disposed of
                    their lands.–The gentle<lb break="no"/>man further informs, that there is
                    now about <lb/>3000 inhabitants in the above county, and that <lb/>the land is
                    of a good quality.</p>
