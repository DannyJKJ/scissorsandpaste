            <hi rend="smallcaps">Highland Emigrants.</hi> –The ship " Midlo<lb break="no"/>thian" has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception <lb/>of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the <lb/>Isle of Skye for Sydney, New South Wales. These <lb/>emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out at a very <lb/>small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the <lb/>passage money being paid by Government out of the <lb/>land revenue of New South Wales, which is exclusive<lb break="no"/>ly appropriated towards the encouragement and promo<lb break="no"/>tion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well <lb/>the relief of those districts in this country which <lb/>are suffering from the want of employment and <lb/>subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of <lb/>a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant fami<lb break="no"/>lies and individuals, the promotion of the moral welfare <lb/>of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we be<lb break="no"/>lieve, receive employment in New South Wales as <lb/>farm-servants, shepherds, overseers, &amp;c. We had a <lb/>brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday af<lb break="no"/>ternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted <lb/>up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient <lb/>that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon <lb/>from Leith to the Isle of Skye.</p>
