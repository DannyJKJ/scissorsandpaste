            <pb/>Another cargo of females is now shipping on board <lb/>the Ann, Captain
                    Herd, in the London Docks, for <lb/>Sydney. These ladies are going out in
                    serarch of hus<lb break="no"/>bands, and to supply the lamentable scarcity of
                    the fair <lb/>sex in our Australian dominions. There is a bounty of <lb/>t8
                    given by government towards defraying the expen<lb break="no"/>ses of the voyage
                    ; and the ladies must be between 15 <lb/>and 30, with good characters and sound
                    constitutions. <lb/>Ass servants they are much wanting among the respec<lb break="no"/>table inhabitants of Sydney and the other towns in the
                    <lb/>colony.</p>
