            <pb/>Thus the British Government is multiplying its <lb/>colonies round the
                    shores of New Holland. Exclusive <lb/>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a
                    separate island, <lb/>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of
                    <lb/>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, <lb/>500 miles
                    south from Sidney ; a third just described, at <lb/>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500
                    miles west from Port Philip ; <lb/>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles
                    west <lb/>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 <lb/>miles north
                    from King George's South. All these <lb/>colonies are in the temperate zone,
                    between the lati<lb break="no"/>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the
                    <lb/>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, <lb/>on the north coast,
                    within the torried zone, in latitude <lb/>12 ; but it was found to be very
                    unhealthy, and was <lb/>abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago.</p>
                <p>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as <lb/>hitherto explored, is one of
                    the most barren and un<lb break="no"/>promising lands in the world, there is a
                    margin of <lb/>good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale <lb/>[?]
                    of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil<lb break="no"/>
            <cb/>
                    <lb/>lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in <lb/>the course of
                    three centuries, it will be the seat of a <lb/>great and powerful nation,
                    cultivating the arts, and <lb/>speaking the language of Britain, and
                    contributing <lb/>powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern
                    <lb/>Hemisphere.</p>
