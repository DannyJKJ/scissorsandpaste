                <p> This city and its vicinity were exceedingly a<lb break="no"/>larmed, last
                    Sabbath, about four o'clock, M. P. by <lb/>a tremendous westerly tornado, which
                    continued <lb/>about 20 minutes, twisting off limbs of trees, un<lb break="no"/>roofing houses, and tumbling down chimneys in <lb/>various parts of the city.
                    Unused to such un<lb break="no"/>ruly gusts, the citizens, particularly the
                    fair, were <lb/>thrown into a momentary d<supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>ation. Terrible <lb/>was the havoc on the water–in

                    the bot<lb break="no"/>tom, and melancholy was the scene. It is said <lb/>that
                    29 persons lost their lives in this neighbour<lb break="no"/>hood, but we have
                    not been able to ascertain who <lb/>they were for certainty. Report says, that a

                    and a young man, were all, except the last <lb/>mentioned, drowned from one boat
                    near Yellow <lb/>Hook, a few miles from the city. It is also said, a sloop
                    overset with 16 persons, all but one of <lb/>whom were drowned. </p>

                    sugar, of superior quality– of <lb/>50 dollars to Comfort Cook, of

                    Saratoga county, for the third rate quantity. <lb/>The society resolved, to

                <p> We hear from Maryland that a number of gen<lb break="no"/>tlmen of the state are

                <p> On Thursday morning, was witnessed a very me<lb break="no"/>lancholy event at

                    <lb/>between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large <lb/>quantity of powder in
                    the mill, which by accident <lb/>took fire and blew up with a great explosion,
                    <lb/>which was heard at Schuylkill ferry, and was there <lb/>supposed to be an
                    earthquake. Mr Kizer, and <lb/>three others who were in the mill, were blown to
                    pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily, a copartner <lb/>of Mr. Kizer, was so wounded
                    that his life is dis<lb break="no"/>pared of. A young woman who happened to be
                    <lb/>near the mill at the time it blew up, had both her <lb/>legs broken, and
                    was otherwise very much injured, <lb/>by one of the rafters which was carried

                <p>"The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men <lb/>and one woman, and stole seven

                    On Saturday last, at Dilly's station <lb/>opposite the mouth of Grave creek, the

                    <p>SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the <lb/>commissioners who
                        were sent to treat with the Indians: <lb/> he had left the commissioners on
                        this side of Lake Erie, that <lb/>day eight days. They had been met at
                        Niagara by Indian <lb/>commissioners, and with them had sailed in separate
                        vessels <lb/>to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit, where
                        <lb/>our commissioners were directed to remain, until an as<lb break="no"/>swer should be brought from the great council of In<lb break="no"/>dian
                        nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the <lb/>Lake. On the 2d of
                        August an answer was brought to <lb/>this effect that the only terms onw
                        hich peace could be <lb/>made was our ceding the country on the west of the
                        Ohio <lb/>and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the
                        <lb/>impossibilities of doing this, as the lands had been sold by the
                        Congress, and people had settled on them, but that the <lb/>United States
                        would be willing to give more goods than <lb/>they had given at any other
                        time. The Indians replied <lb/>that if the Congress would give one half
                        these goods to the people that had settled, the would leave the land, and
                        <lb/>remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the <lb/>land
                        they must have, and would not give it up. The In<lb break="no"/>dians said
                        it was well, and there need no more be said. <lb/>However desired them to
                        remain if they thought proper <lb/>until they rerturned to the council, and
                        laid this before them. <lb/>On the 16th of August two Indians came and
                        informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country
                        <lb/>in question or war. The express is of opinion from the <lb/>language of
                        individual Indians in private, and from other <lb/>circumstances, that the
                        British wholly conduct their council, <lb/>and dictate their demands. </p>
                    <p> By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on <lb/>Monday last, we
                        are informed, that the Indians still conti<lb break="no"/>ue hovering about
                        our garrisons, and occasionally stealing <lb/>horses, that the army is in
                        high spirits, anxiously waiting <lb/>the event of the treaty, and hoping
                        that a campaign will <lb/>take place, as no idea of peace is entertained by
                        any one; <lb/>that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander
                        <lb/>in chief, in training his men in the act wood fighting, <lb/>and that
                        from their proficiency, and the <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied>imity pre<lb break="no"/>vailing throughout the whole army,
                        success may be expec<lb break="no"/>ted should a campaign take place. </p>
