            <pb n="5"/> The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six <lb/>in number. They
                    have been indiscriminately styl<lb break="no"/>ed Cherokees, but three of them
                    only are of that <lb/>nation, and three are Creek Indians.â€“They are
                    <lb/>all handsome men, not exceeding in age twenty- <lb/>five or twenty-six.
                    These six Chiefs have 20,000 <lb/>warriors ready to take the field, and have the
                    <lb/>strongest wish to act in conjunction with the Eng<lb break="no"/>lish. They
                    travelled 3000 miles before the reach<lb break="no"/>ed Halifax, and were near
                    12 months in perform<lb break="no"/>ing the journey. From Halifax they went in
                    an <lb/>English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester, <lb/>by whom they were
                    sent over to England to con<lb break="no"/>cert their plans in person with the
                    Ministry.</p>
                <p>The object of their coming to this country may <lb/>be easily guessed at. They
                    long to make an at<lb break="no"/>tack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them
                    <lb/>was heard last night in the playhouse to say, he <lb/>hoped in six months
                    from this time to be in the <lb/>heart of Mexico.</p>
