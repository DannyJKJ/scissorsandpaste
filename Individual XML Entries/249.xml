            <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration</hi>–We observe from an advertisement
                    <lb/>in our paper of to-day, that another ship is fitting out <lb/>by
                    Government, for the free conveyance of females to <lb/>Van Dieman's Land ; and
                    as we understand that many <lb/>applications were made too late for the last
                    ship, we <lb/>would recommend those anxious to take advantage of <lb/>this
                    opportunity, to lose no time in making the necces<lb break="no"/>sary
                    application at Leith,–the number being strictly <lb/>limited, and being
                    the last ship to sail this year. We <lb/>consider it of great advantage to
                    females of respecta<lb break="no"/>bility, that none are admitted without a
                    strict investi<lb break="no"/>gation into their moral character by the
                    Emigration <lb/>Committee ; and that those of a superior class, as
                    <lb/>governesses, &amp;c. are provided a small sum, to defray the ex<lb break="no"/>pense of the extra outfit.</p>
