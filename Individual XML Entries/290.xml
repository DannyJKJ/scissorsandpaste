            <hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand</hi>.â€“On Wednesday a public meeting
                    <lb/>was held in the Guildhall of the city of London, pur<lb break="no"/>suant
                    to a requisition to the Lord Mayor, for the pur<lb break="no"/>pose of
                    petitioning her Majesty and both Houses of <lb/>Parliament " to adopt prompt and
                    efficient measures <lb/>for preserving from invasion or abandonment the long<lb break="no"/>established sovereignty of the British Crown in the <lb/>islands
                    of New Zealand, at present endangered by <lb/>foreign pretensions, and by the
                    acts of the Executive Go<lb break="no"/>vernment ; also for stopping the course
                    of lawless emi<lb break="no"/>gration and settlement, which has not only proved
                    <lb/>deeply injurious to the native people of the country, <lb/>but threatens
                    their speedy extermination ; and, lastly, <lb/>for establishing the most
                    beneficial system of coloni<lb break="no"/>zation, and the protection and
                    restraints of British <lb/>law, under a distinct colonial government, in place
                    of <lb/>the state of anarchy which now prevails among both <lb/>races, and all
                    other classes of her Majesty's subjects, and <lb/>others inhabiting or resorting
                    to New Zealand, as a <lb/>distant independency of the territory of New South
                    <lb/>Wales." Including the gentlemen of the hustings, <lb/>the entire number
                    might be calculated at 400 indivi<lb break="no"/>duals. The Lord Mayor took the
                    chair. Resolu<lb break="no"/>tions in accordance with the object of the meeting
                    <lb/>were moved and seconded by Mr G. Palmer, M.P., <lb/>Mr F. Baring, M.P., Mr
                    Hawes, M.P., Mr G. F. <lb/>Young, Mr Ward, M.P., and others. On the mo<lb break="no"/>tion of Mr G. Robinson, seconded by Mr Donaldson, <lb/>a
                    petition was adopted by the meeting, to be presented <lb/>to the Queen by the
                    Earl of Devon, to the House of <lb/>Peers by Lord Ashburton, and to the Commons
                    by <lb/>Lord Eliot.</p>
