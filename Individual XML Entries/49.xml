            <pb/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<lb break="no"/>ved there from
                    Hispaniola, there are advices that <lb/>the French inhabitants of that island
                    feel, with <lb/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which <lb/>their
                    patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<lb break="no"/>barked. Men of every
                    class and description wear <lb/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their
                    <lb/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<lb break="no"/>stance to
                    ours, have filled them with the most <lb/>lively hopes, and animated them with a
                    spirit of <lb/>resistance to the measures of their Government, <lb/>as forcible
                    as it was unexpected by those entrust<lb break="no"/>ed with the executive
                    power. At Port au Prince <lb/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered
                    <lb/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts <lb/>to counteract an
                    impulse that is irresistible. The <lb/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has
                    been <lb/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that <lb/>both shall
                    immediately quit the colony, and their <lb/>departure is hourly expected. The
                    press, hither<lb break="no"/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its
                        free<lb break="no"/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<lb break="no"/>count of the proceedings of the States General <lb/>without the
                    smallest reserve.</p>
