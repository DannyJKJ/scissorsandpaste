                    <lb/>Intelligence has been received, that in some <lb/>trivial dispute with a
                    native Indian, a Spaniard <lb/>has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto, and
                    <lb/>then fled. The nation to whom the Indian be<lb break="no"/>longed, being
                    made acquainted with the murder, <lb/>sent a deputation to the Governor,
                    demanding <lb/>that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered <lb/>up as an
                    attonement. This was peremptorily re<lb break="no"/>fused, as being more than
                    commensurate to the <lb/>offence, but the murderer was offered as a satis<lb break="no"/>faction; the Indians would not accept him singly, <lb/>and
                    departed, vowing the severest revenge: a <lb/>few days afterwards intelligence
                    was received that <lb/>they had surprised and massacred sixteen men, <lb/>who
                    had been at work in the woods; and when <lb/>the vessel departed, the Spaniards
                    were flying, <lb/>with the utmost precipitation and terror, from <lb/>all parts
                    of the country, seeking shelter in the <lb/>forts.</p>
