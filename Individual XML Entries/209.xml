            <hi rend="italic">Bervic.</hi> â€“There has been raised this season on the <lb/>high lands of the farm of Hallgreen, belonging to Mr <lb/>Blair, a few acres of<hi rend="italic">Rib-grass</hi>, a native plant of New <lb/>South Wales. It was imported to this country two <lb/>years ago by a man who had served his time in Van <lb/>Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be high <lb/>land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it <lb/>appears not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed <lb/>with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the <lb/>best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for <lb/>producing mik from cows, of the best and richest qua<lb break="no"/>lity. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland <lb/>country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, <lb/>we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful <lb/>plant, instead of the useless heath, with at present, even <lb/>at best, only adorns them.</p>
