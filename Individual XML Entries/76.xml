            <pb/>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs <lb/>visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's, which they <lb/>explain with an equal degree of curiosity and</p>
                <p>
            <pb/>amazement. They were asked whether they <lb/>would not attend the evening service, which they <lb/>readily complied, and seemed particularly de<lb break="no"/>lighted with the organ.</p>
                <p>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer <lb/>of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges us to make <lb/>them some acknowledgement, whether we accept <lb/>their offer or not.–We can very well spare them <lb/>the members of the<hi rend="italic">Halter Club</hi>,–all our house<lb break="no"/>breakers, highwaymen, pick pockets, swindlers, <lb/>Faro and E O Table keepers,–and all their ac<lb break="no"/>complices to an amazing number.</p>
                <p>Such a collection would be a truly valuable <lb/>present.–Among them are found dispersedly all <lb/>the qualities of able Generals,–skilful Financiers, <lb/>–able Negotiators, active Citizens,–and men <lb/>highly expert at a<hi rend="italic">Coup de Main</hi>.</p>
                <p>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,–the <lb/>Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their <lb/>own country enter into a boxing war against their <lb/>enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant <lb/>success.</p>
                <p>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would per<lb break="no"/>haps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of <lb/>most people, that a few thousands of the latter <lb/>description of men might be spared.</p>
