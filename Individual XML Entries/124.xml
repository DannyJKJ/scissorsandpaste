            <pb/>New York and other American papers have <lb/>been received to the 20th
                    December: – In the <lb/>house of Representatives, on the 9th, Mr John<lb break="no"/>son brought forward a series of resolutions re<lb break="no"/>lative to the military establish, the principal <lb/>of which is the
                    following: –</p>
                <p>"That the military peace establishment of the United <lb/>States shall consist
                    hereafter of eight thousand men, including <lb/>the corps of invalids. Provided
                    that the corps of engineers, <lb/>the General Staff and Ordnance Department
                    shall be re<lb break="no"/>tained, as at present established. Provided also,
                    that no part <lb/>of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said re<lb break="no"/>duction, but the same shall be effected by permitting vacan<lb break="no"/>cies, as they occur, to remain – That it is expedient to
                        pro<lb break="no"/>vide by law for an additional national armoury, to be
                    located <lb/>on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by <lb/>law
                    a corps of invalids, to be composed of one thousand <lb/>men."</p>
                <p>The following resolution relative to foreign <lb/>seamen was also proposed, and
                    adopted without <lb/>opposition :</p>
                <p>"Resolved. That the Committee of Commerce and <lb/>Manufactures be instructed to
                    inquire into the expediency <lb/>of providing by law for the apprehending and
                    securing foreign <lb/>seamen deserting from foreign vessels while in the ports
                    of <lb/>the United States, contrary to their engagements to serve on <lb/>board
                    such vessels."</p>
