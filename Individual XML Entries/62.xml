                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">October</hi> 31. We are informed by very respec<lb break="no"/>table authority, that Mr. M'Gillvry has written <lb/>to the President of the
                    United States, a full and <lb/>sensible account of the rise and progress of the
                    <lb/>disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from <lb/>which statement he
                    expected to prove, to a de<lb break="no"/>monstration, that he has not acted the
                    inconsistent <lb/>part which some have alleged, neither has there <lb/>been such
                    cruelties committed by the Indians.</p>
                <p>From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities, and consi<lb break="no"/>dering he was educated
                    in Europe, being the son <lb/>of a Scotchman and Indian women, we have no
                    <lb/>reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of <lb/>his people; but, on
                    the contrary, it is rather to <lb/>be presumed that his proposals, which are
                        contain<lb break="no"/>ed in his letter to the President, are of a rational
                    <lb/>nature, and many probably bring about a final and <lb/>an advantageous
                    treaty with the United States.</p>
