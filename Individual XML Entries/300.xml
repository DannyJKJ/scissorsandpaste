            <hi rend="smallcaps">Emigration to New Zealand.</hi>–On Friday the
                    <lb/>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the <lb/>river on her voyage
                    to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. <lb/>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she
                    takes out 50 <lb/>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the
                    <lb/>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of <lb/>other passengers,
                    amongst whom are Mr Swainson, <lb/>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin,
                    Attorney-General, of <lb/>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<lb break="no"/>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort <lb/>of the
                    emigrants on board were certainly very com<lb break="no"/>plete ; and it must be
                    gratifying to know that those <lb/>persons sent out by the company will be
                    provided <lb/>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a <lb/>great
                    quantity of patent preserved provisions being <lb/>shipped for that purpose on
                    board the Tyne. There <lb/>are a greater number of children than usual in the
                    <lb/>Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of <lb/>from eight
                    to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, <lb/>which now lies in the London
                    Dock, will clear out on <lb/>the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty
                    well <lb/>clear the depot of its present inmates.</p>
