            <hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealandâ€“Name of the Capital City.</hi>
                    <lb/>?It will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Welling<lb break="no"/>ton to
                    learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand <lb/>Company have resolved that the
                    name of the city <lb/>founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, <lb/>Port
                    Nicholson, and which is destined to become the <lb/>capital of New Zealand,
                    shall be named "The City <lb/>of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke.
                    <lb/>The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to <lb/>him the
                    promoters of colonization of South Aus<lb break="no"/>tralia were in a great
                    measure indebted for securing <lb/>the enactment of the statute which gave
                    effect to the <lb/>principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many
                    <lb/>of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Di<lb break="no"/>rectors of the New Zealand Company, they have re<lb break="no"/>solved,
                    setting all party politics aside, to confer this ho<lb break="no"/>nour on the
                    Duke. There could be no stronger proof of <lb/>the political sagacity and
                    statesmanlike views of the <lb/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system
                    <lb/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating <lb/>his name than by
                    bestowing it on the metropolis of the <lb/>"Great Britain of the Southern
                    Hemisphere."</p>
