            <pb/>Colonial Intelligence</p>
                <p>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, to the 22d
                    October, and they are sa<lb break="no"/>tisfactory in all points of view, but
                    especially with re<lb break="no"/>ference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay.
                    His <lb/>Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was <lb/>taking some
                    effectual measures to place the coinage <lb/>of the colony upon a better
                    footing, and on the 13th <lb/>of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying
                    a <lb/>very large quantity of base money. He has also taken <lb/>measure to
                    communicate to the new settlers from <lb/>England the full benefit ofthe Courts
                    of Justice es<lb break="no"/>blished in that quarter of the world.</p>
                <p>We have received an account of the loss of the A<lb break="no"/>beona[?]
                    transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, <lb/>with settlers. The following is
                    an extract of a letter <lb/>from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec.
                    <lb/>"The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th <lb/>inst. from
                    Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who <lb/>escaped from the Abeona transport,
                    bound to the Cape <lb/>of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the
                    <lb/>25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. <lb/>The Agent,
                    Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 <lb/>men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls,
                    got into three <lb/>boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da
                    <lb/>Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."</p>
                <p>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, <lb/>which give detailed
                    accounts of the number and state <lb/>of the slaves in that part of the West
                    Indies. The re<lb break="no"/>port is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new
                    Slave <lb/>Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial <lb/>statement of
                    the slave population, and the Reporter <lb/>makes some judicious comparative
                    remarks. It ap<lb break="no"/>pears that there has been a large decrease of the
                        num<lb break="no"/>ber by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as
                    <lb/>compared with the former year. Births have been in <lb/>the proportion of
                    one to forty-six. The Report de<lb break="no"/>fends the [?] of the West India
                    Planters, and ob<lb break="no"/>serves that the state of the Black population
                    serves[?] <lb/>to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the <lb/>kindness, the
                    liberality, and induglent care of pro<lb break="no"/>piertors. It adds, that
                    their own interests is a perpe<lb break="no"/>tual[?] evil[?] upon their
                    humanity. In the colony there <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?] <lb/>[?] [?] [?]
                    <lb/>slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles <lb/>and there are 38,910
                    female slaves of the same dono<lb break="no"/>mination, making a total of
                    76,929. The slave po<lb break="no"/>pulation in 1817, amounted in the whole to
                    77,867.– <lb/>The number of births which have occurred since that
                    <lb/>period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report con<lb break="no"/>cludes
                    with some gratifying observations upon the <lb/>flourishing state of the
                    colony.</p>
