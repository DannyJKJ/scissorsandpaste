            <pb n="6"/>Letters from Alexandria, in Virginia, dated <lb/>the 9th May last,
                    mention, that General Wayne <lb/>had been dispatched, in the beginning of March,
                    <lb/>on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis <lb/>and Chickesau Indians,
                    who have, for some time <lb/>past, had as their chief warrior, one Macgillivray,
                    <lb/>a Scotchman, who has long resided among these <lb/>Indians. General Wayne,
                    at the head of two <lb/>thousand Provincials, had completely routed them
                    <lb/>after a great slaughter. After the battle, Mac<lb break="no"/>gillivray and
                    his savages took refuge in the woods. <lb/>General Wayne has destroyed the most
                    part of <lb/>the habitation of these Indians in the extent of <lb/>200 English
                    miles along the river, which is the <lb/>boundary of Georgia, after which he
                    returned to <lb/>Savannah. This defeat is so total, that it will put <lb/>it out
                    of the power of these Indians to be again <lb/>troublesome to the State of
                    Virginia.</p>
