                <p>By the Dunlop, Captain Abrams, arrived on Sun<lb break="no"/>day last, at
                    Greenock, from Quebec, after a passage <lb/>of 36 days, papers and letters have
                    been received from <lb/>Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an
                    <lb/>engagement between a detachment of the British <lb/>force under Lieut.-Col.
                    Morrison, consisting of the <lb/>49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies
                    of <lb/>the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, <lb/>amounting to
                    4000 men, which ended in the defeat <lb/>of the latter, with great loss. This
                    action was pro<lb break="no"/>duced by the attempt of the American General to
                    <lb/>advance to Montreal, from which it appears, how<lb break="no"/>ever, he has
                    now begun to measure back his steps, <lb/>having crossed to the American side of
                    the river <lb/>where the action was fought, and being actively pur<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>sued in his retreat by the British troops.</p>
                <p>The following information has been received by <lb/>the Alexander, Captain Henry,
                    which arrived at Li<lb break="no"/>verpool on Tuesday:–</p>
                <p>"Quebec, Nov. 26. 1813 <lb/>"The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men,
                    <lb/>under the command of General Wilkinson. The <lb/>division commanded by
                    General Boyd, consisting of <lb/>about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c.
                    was alone <lb/>engaged upon the 11th instant.</p>
                <p>"The enemy lost in the action, Brigadier Gen. <pb/>Conington and Colonel Preston, killed–probably <lb/>600 men killed,
                    wounded, and taken.</p>
                <p>"The consequence was a precipitate retreat across <lb/>the St Lawrence at
                    Cornwall on the 13th, and eva<lb break="no"/>cuating the province. General
                    Wilkinson marched <lb/>his troops into the Straits, the route of Plattsburgh,
                    <lb/>leaving all his boats, upwards of 300, in the Salmon <lb/>river, where they
                    were frozen in on the 16th, and <lb/>2000 men to protect them."</p>
                <p>Colonel Plenderleath came home in the Alexander, <lb/>with dispatches.</p>
