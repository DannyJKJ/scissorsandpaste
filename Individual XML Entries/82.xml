                <p>"The drafts at Cork yesterday received the a<lb break="no"/>greeable orders to
                    return to their respective regi<lb break="no"/>ments immediately.</p>
                <p>"The officers appointed to raise independent <lb/>companies in Ireland, have
                    received orders to re<lb break="no"/>pair forthwith to England, with whatever
                        com<lb break="no"/>plement of men already entered, but not to <lb/>proceed
                    with the completion of their number : <lb/>in conference to this order, they are
                    preparing <lb/>for their immediate departure.</p>
                <p>"Last Tuesday two eminent merchants of <lb/>this city received orders, by way of
                    a vessel ar<lb break="no"/>rived at Cork, from Mess de Fouseca Olivarez <lb/>and
                    Co. at Seville, for the immediate exportation <lb/>of cotton, white linen, and
                    mixed goods, to a <lb/>very large amount.</p>
                <p>"Monday evening the Elizabeth and Mary, <lb/>Mark Purcell, master, arrived at
                    Waterford from <lb/>Annapolis, in Maryland, after a long and dan<lb break="no"/>gerous passage, of 52 days, in which they had <lb/>nearly exhausted the whole
                    of their provisions, <lb/>having been a very short allowance of half a
                    <lb/>naggin of rum, diluted with one pint of bad wa<lb break="no"/>ter, for
                    twenty-four hours. She is heavy laden, <lb/>having on board six hundread
                    hogsheads of tobac<lb break="no"/>co, a large quantity of pipe staves, barrel
                    hoops, <lb/>&amp;c. and has been expected more than two months. <lb/>Eight per
                    cent was offered as insurance on ship <lb/>and cargo, but refused, on account of
                    the then <lb/>probability of a war."</p>
