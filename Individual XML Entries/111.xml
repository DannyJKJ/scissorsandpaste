                <p>The following letter received in town, gives a de<lb break="no"/>scription of the
                    wanton and barbarous conduct of the <lb/>American army, in destroying a
                    settlement of the <lb/>Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into
                    <lb/>province:â€“</p>
                <p>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North <lb/>America, by a
                    letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, <lb/>concerning a report of the total
                    destruction of our settlement, <lb/>
            <supplied reason="copy blur">???
                        ???</supplied> on the 6th of October, by the American <lb/>army under
                    General Harrison. It was the consequence of the <lb/>invasion of that province,
                    after the capture of the little fleet <lb/>on Lake Erie, and the defeat of the
                    s[?]al British force under the <lb/>[?] of occupying the Chapel and some other
                    houses for <lb/>our sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the
                        Chris<lb break="no"/>tian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans,
                    it was <lb/>his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation
                    <lb/>should retreat farther into the country. When the Americans <lb/>were
                    successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps <lb/>of effect it.
                    The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, <lb/>and offered to purchase
                    the houses and cottages, but their de<lb break="no"/>feat prevented it. On
                    entering the place, the Americans first <lb/>pretended to be friendly, and sorry
                    that the Indians had fled, <lb/>who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the
                        Mission<lb break="no"/>aries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged
                        Mis<lb break="no"/>sionary, Michael Young, remained.</p>
                <p>"During the first night the Americans already changed <lb/>their tone, or rather
                    showed their real character. They began <lb/>to abuse the Missionaries with
                    curses, and all manner of insults, <lb/>plundering the houses ; and General
                    Harrison, to whom we ap<lb break="no"/>pealed, would grant no redress. They took
                    every thing that <lb/>was <supplied reason="copy blur">???</supplied> away ;
                    and, under a pretence that King's stores <lb/>and English goods were lodged in
                    the houses, ransacked every <lb/>place, and every trunk and chest belonging to
                    individuals. Com<lb break="no"/>modore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito
                    fleet on the <lb/>lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest,
                        ad<lb break="no"/>vicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could.
                    <lb/>They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans <lb/>set the
                    place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every <lb/>outhouse[?]. The poor
                    Missionaries had a very tedious journey, <lb/>and reached Silitiz, a settlement
                    of the Brethren in Pennsyl<lb break="no"/>vania, December 11. Whither the
                    Christian Indians have fled <lb/>is not known ; they had proposed to go to the
                    Grand River, <lb/>about 100 miles off.</p>
