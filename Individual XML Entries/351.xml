            <pb n="6"/> By private letters and newspapers lately arrived <lb/>from
                    Philadelphia and New York we have inform<lb break="no"/>mation, that the Indians
                    are carrying on their de<lb break="no"/>predations on the back settlements of
                    the United <lb/>States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to <lb/>the
                    miscarriage of the war had been made by <lb/>Congress, and an army was collected
                    this year; <lb/>that the Americans had some expectations of get<lb break="no"/>ting free of the Indian war by treaties.</p>
                <p>We have advices of Governor Clinton's being <lb/>re-elected Governor of New York
                    state by a ma<lb break="no"/>jority of 180, but the friends of Mr. Tay were
                    <lb/>objecting to the return, as the canvassers had not <lb/>opened the boxes
                    which contained the returns <lb/>from three counties, Otsego, Clinton, and
                    Tioga, <lb/>which if opened they say would have given the <lb/>election to Mr.
                    Tay, the county of Otsego alone <lb/>being 300 majority in favours of Mr.
                    Tay.</p>
                <p>A dreadful storm happened at New York on <lb/>the 1st of July, which continued
                    with so much <lb/>violence, that several vessels were driven from their
                    <lb/>moorings, and a number of boats upset and many <lb/>lives lost.</p>
