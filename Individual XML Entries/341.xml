                </p>
                <p>By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn, that <lb/>the people are in quietness,
                    but still armed; and <lb/>that the Governor, who had been suffered to re<lb break="no"/>main, but the Intendent only having fled, is per<lb break="no"/>fectly submissive to the will of the people.</p>
                <p>For several days last week the weather at the <lb/>north side, and in some of the
                    Liguanea Moun<lb break="no"/>tains blew in most alarming gusts, and the cold
                    <lb/>is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plan<lb break="no"/>tain trees
                    have been thrown down, but we have <lb/>yet heard of no material damage.</p>
                <p>The sloop Resolution has brought into port a <lb/>part of his Majesty's 10th
                    regiment of foot, con<lb break="no"/>sisting of a serjeant, and 29 privates,
                    having re<lb break="no"/>ceived them from on board the ship Commerce, <lb/>Foot,
                    from London, off the East End on Thurs<lb break="no"/>day last, the Commerce
                    being destined for Savan<lb break="no"/>na la Mar.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Dec</hi>. 26. Late on Thursday evening his Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's ship Amphion, Captain Nichols, returned <lb/>to Port-Royal from the
                    Spanish American coast. <lb/>The Amphion was bound to Carthagena, but was
                    <lb/>prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from <lb/>entering that port.
                    Accounts are said to be re<lb break="no"/>ceived by her that a revolt has taken
                    place a<lb break="no"/>mongst the Indians in that quarter, and that the
                    <lb/>Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications <lb/>throughout the country,
                    which it has cost them <lb/>so much labour and expence to raise; so appre<lb break="no"/>
                    <lb/>hensive are they of the numbers and force of the <lb/>malcontents, should
                    they possess themselves of any <lb/>of those strong holds.</p>
                <p>We learn from Georgia, that the treaty with <lb/>the Indians, to negotiate with
                    Commissioners <lb/>were appointed by the President of the United <lb/>States,
                    has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gil<lb break="no"/>livray and his warriors
                    have declared, that nothing <lb/>short of a cession of the territory between the
                        ri<lb break="no"/>vers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; <lb/>adding,
                    that no equivalent can be given to the <lb/>Georgians for relinquishing their
                    claim to the di<lb break="no"/>strict in question, as it is founded in
                    usurpation. <lb/>The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this re<lb break="no"/>quisition are evident, as it is known that he wish<lb break="no"/>es to
                    establish a sea-port at St Mary's, as well <lb/>for thecommercial emolument, as
                    for the civili<lb break="no"/>zation of his countrymen, by an intercourse with
                    <lb/>foreign States.</p>
