ID12,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,24,inform,A letter from the Bay of Honduras dated May 26 says The Spaniards who pay an annual visit to this settlement to prevent encroachments are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore alledging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes and might be productive of mischief were it not that the British Superintendant Colonel Despar with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home and certainly will raise provisions here.ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers too will be able to take their runs so speedily that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby.
