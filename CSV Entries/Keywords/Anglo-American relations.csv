In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world.Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.,Anglo-American relations ID68,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,09,inform,We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May from which the following is extracted:–Quebec May 20.We hear late accounts from Niagara mention that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States that they had now raised an army to take their own for Niagara and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on and that they would punish those that should interfere.It was also said that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited by that event.We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them to think of accepting any more from that quarter and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic before they testify their impatience that national treaties like private agreements are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive.[As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.]May 24.The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington have received letters from the Captian Kendrick dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them that he passed the winter preceding on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had been at Nootka and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America.[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last (see Glasgow Intelligence p. 424) and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.],Anglo-American relations ID94,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,22,inform,Philadelphia June 1.We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of Penn sylvania prosecutions have been instituted against John Singleterry and Gideon Henfield charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the United States entering on board the armed schooner Genet in the service of France and with others on board the said schooner capturing several vessels the property of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said subjects contrary to the Laws of Nations and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States and his said Britannic Majesty.The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of Philadelphia to take their trial at the next Circuit Court of the United States.A letter from Charleston dated May 10 says Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived here from Augusta in Georgia who informs that six of the Creek Towns with a number of Cherokees had declared war against the United States and were actually marching under the command of Bowles and Gilpin at attack the frontiers.,Anglo-American relations ID365,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,08,30,persuade,Each day brings additional strength to the report of a rupture with America. The representtations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister Mr. Pickney include various topics of complaint. Amongst these are the withholding of the poste of Niagara Detroit &c. in violation of the treat of 1783; the exciting of of the Creek and other Indians to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwalis & in the Southern States according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic.The American Minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure.Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-judged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank) who would advise another American war –a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woes.,Anglo-American relations ID371,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,12,13,inform,Extracts from the New-York Daily Advertiser.Pittsburgh Sept. 7.SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie that day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands.By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the ???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place.New York Sept. 17.A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event proved their opinion to be just.According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467.Philadelphia Sept. 21.The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road–O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens!Sept. 25.Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward.We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights.New-York Sept. 28.Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant.You request I would endeavour to give you a particular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in a destitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there.The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead.The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others.The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day.The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush-Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations.The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now.By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers–And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush.October 2.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28.The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality.We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy.Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious–its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off.Philadelphia Oct. 7.Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart.Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore.Winchester Sept. 20.Extract of a letter from our correspondent at ??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4.Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The ???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes.From the same dated Sept. 14.On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court-House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile.New-York Oct. 16.Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.,Anglo-American relations ID373,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,27,inform,FEDERAL LEGISLATURE.House of Representatives. Dec. 3.THE Secretary of the Senate announced that the Members of the Senate were ready to admit the Members of the House of Representatives in the Senate Chamber in order to receive the President's communication.FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESSince the commencement of the term for which I havebeen again called into office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizens at large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimony of public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude for all those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoured by my country; on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for that retirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me. But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated according to its real motives; and that the people and the authorities derived from them would support exertions having nothing personal for their object I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the executive power; and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations depends to crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness.As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom the United States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehend that our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our disposition for peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained by belligerent nations. It seemed therefore to be my duty to admonish our citizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile acts to any of the parties; and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legal state of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belonging to our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will be laid before you was issued.In this posture of affairs both new and delicate I resolved to adopt general rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privileges of the United States. These were reduced into a system which will be communicated to you. Although I have not thought myself at liberty to forbid the sale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to be brought into our ports; I have not refused to cause them to be restored when they were taken within the protection of our territory or by vessels commissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the United States.It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct im prove or enforce this plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extend the legal code and the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States to many cases which though dependent on principles already recognized demand some further provisions.Where individuals shall within the United States array themselves in hostility against any of the powers at war or enter upon military expeditions or enterprizes within the jurisdiction of the United States; or where the penalties on violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked or are inadequate; those offenses cannot receive too early and close an attention and require prompt and decisive remedies.Whatsoever those remedies may be they will be well administered by the judiciary who possess a long-established course of investigation effectual process and officers in the habit of executing it.In like manner as several of the courts have doubted under particular circumstances their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace and even of a citizen of the United States although seized under a false colour of being hostile property; and have denied their power to liberate certain captures within the protection of our territory; it would seem proper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the executive is to be the resort in either of the two last mentioned cases it is hoped that he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courts when for his own information he shall request it.I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessity of placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exacting from them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United States ought not to indulge a persuasion that contrary to the order of human events they will for ever keep at a distance those painful appeals to arms with which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it; If we desire to secure peace one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity it must be known that we are at all times ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you will shew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazines and arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies cannot with prudence be neglected as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuring a warlike apparatus in the moment of public danger.Nor can such arrangements with such objects be exposed to the censure or jealousy of the warmest friends of Republican Government. They are incapable of abuse in the hands of the militia who ought to possess a pride in being the depository of the force of the Republic and may be trained to a degree of energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But it is an enquiry which cannot be too solemnly pursued whether the act more effectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniform militia throughout the United States has organized them so as to produce their full effect; whether your own experience in the several States has not detected some imperfections in the scheme; and whether a material feature in an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for the study of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever be attained by practice alone.The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremely interesting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under the knowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequent communication.When we contemplate the war on our frontiers it may be truly affirmed that every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissension with the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the Commissioners evince a moderation and equity; proceeding from a sincere love of peace and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests and dignity of the United States. The attempt however of an amicable negotiation having been frustrated the troops have marched to act offensively. Although the proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation it is doubtful how far the advance of the season before good faith justified active movements may retard them during the remainder of the year. From the papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject you will determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted by law shall be compensated by succors of militia or additional encouragements shall be proposed to recruits.An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace with the Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn and with clothing and offensive measures against them prohibited during the recess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter prosecutions have been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the papers which will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which we stand in regard to both those tribes; and it is with Congress to pronounce what shall be done.After they shall have provided for the present emergency it will merit their most serious labours to render tranquillity with the savages permanent by creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice on the violators of peace the establishment of commerce with the Indian nations in behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud without extortion; with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive in exchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be allured by the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to be reimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion of Congress they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any means yet in the hands of the Executive.GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESThe commissioners charged with the settlement of the accounts between the United and Individual States concluded their important function within the limited time by law; and the balances struck in their report which will be laid before congress have been placed on the books of the Treasury.On the 1st day of June last an installment of on million of florins became payable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loan at an interest of five per cent. for the term of ten years; and the expenses of this operation were a commission of three per cent.The first installment of the loan of two millions of dollars from the Bank of the United States has been paid as was directed by law. For the second it is necessary that provision be made.No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the redemption and discharge of the public debt: On none can delay be more injurious or an economy of time more valuable.The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected to prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will therefore it is presumed be requisite: and it is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of ourcitizens who can not but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviate a future accumulation of burdens.But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportation of public prints. There is no resource so firm for the government of the United States as the affections of the People guided by an enlightened policy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithful representation of public proceedings diffused without restraint throughout the United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current service of the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and military stores made during the recess will be presented to Congress.GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESThe several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide range to your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of our common country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude of your task:–Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the government may be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentiment its dignity may be lost.–But as the legislative proceedings of the United States will never I trust be reproached for the want of temper or of candour so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of my strenuous and warmest cooperation.GEORGE WASHINGTON.Philadelphia Dec. 3 1793The President having withdrawn the Members of the House of Representatives returned to their Chamber where the President's Address was read and referred to a Committee to report the draft of an answer.A Committee was then appointed to report the unfinished business of the last House.–Adjourned.Thursday Dec. 5.The Journal of the Commissioners for treating with the Indians was read. It is minute and lengthy. The definitive answer of the Indians contains their reasons for rejecting the proposals of the Commissioners drawn up in a masterly manner it bears all the appearance of EUropean logic faintly clad in an Indian dress. All the documents relative to this business were referred to a Committee of the whole on the state of the Union.A message was received from the President communication sundry papers relative to our European relations and also the result of the proceedings of the Commissioners appointed to settle the accounts of the United States with the Individual States.The first set of papers is introduced by a message of which the following is a copy:United States Dec. 5 1793 GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESAs the present situations of the several nations of Europe and especially of those with whom the United States have important relations cannot but render the state of things between them and us; matter of interesting enquiry to the Legislature and may indeed give rise to deliberations to which they alone are competent I have thought it my duty to communicate them certain correspondencies which have taken place.The Representatives and Executive Bodies of France have manifested generally a friendly attachment to this country; have given advantages to our commerce and navigation and have made overtures for placing these advantages on permanent ground; a decree however of the National Assembly subjecting vessels laden with provisions to be carried into their ports and making enemy goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend contrary to our treaty though revoked at one time as to the United States has been since extended to their vessels also as has been recently stated to us. Representations on this subject will be immediately given in charge to our Minister there and the result shall be communicated to the Legislature.It is with extreme concern I have to inform you that the proceedings of the person whom they have unfortunately appointed their Minister Plenipotentiary here have breathed nothing of the friendly spirit of that nation which sent him; their tendency on the contrary has been to involve us in a war abroad; and discord and anarchy at home. So far as his acts or those of his agents have threatened our immediate commitment in the war or flagrant insult to the authority of the laws their effect has been counteracted by the ordinary cognizance of the laws and by an exertions of the powers confided to me. Where their danger was not imminent they have been born with from sentiments of regard to his nation from a sense of their friendship towards us from a conviction that they would not suffer us to remain long exposed to the action of a person who has so little respectedour mutual dispositions and I will add from a reliance on the firmness of my fellow citizens in their principles of peace and order. In the mean time I have respected and pursued the stipulations of our treaties according to what I judge the true sense; and have withheld no act of friendship which their affairs have called for from us and which justice to others let us free to perform. I have gone further;–rather than employ force for the restitution of certain vessels which I deemed the United States bound to restore I thought it more advisable to satisfy the parties by avowing it to be my opinion that if restitution were not made it would be incumbent on the United States to make compensation. The papers now communicated will more particularly apprize you of these transactions.The vexations and spolitation understood to have been committed on our vessels and commerce by the cruizers and officers of some of the belligerent powers appeared to require attention. The proofs of these however not having been brought forward the description of citizens supposed to have suffered were notified that on furnishing them to the Executive Power due measures would be taken to obtain redress of the past and more effectual provisions against the future. Should such documents be furnished proper representations will be made thereon with a just resistance on a redress proportioned to eh exigency of the case.The BRitish Government having undertaken by orders to the commanders of their armed vessels to restrain generally our commerce in corn and other provisions to their own ports and those of their friends the instructions now communicated were immediately forwarded to our Minister at that court. In the mean time some discussions on the subject took place between him and them; these are also laid before you; and I may expect to learn the result of his special instructions in time to make it known to the legislature during their present sessions.Very early after the arrival of a British Minister here mutual explanation on the execution of the Treaty of Peace were entered into with that Minister; these are now laid before you for your information.On the subjects of mutual interest between this country and Spain negociations and conferences are now depending. The public requiring that the present state of those should be made known to the legislature in confidence only they shall be the subject of a separate and subsequent communication.G. WASHINGTONMr. Madison reported the draft of an Answer to the Address of the President.The remainder of this sitting was employed in beginning the reading of the papers received from the President which are voluminous.,Anglo-American relations ID375,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,21,inform,United States June 4 1794.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesLay before Congress the copy of a letter with its enclosure from the Secretary of State to the Minister Plenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty; it being an answer to a letter from the Mnister to him; bearing date the 22 ult. and already communicated.GEO. WASHINGTON.Philadelphia June 2 1794.SIRIf the letter with which you honoured me on the 22d ult. had not entered into a train of recrimination against the United States I should not now trouble you with a return to its unpleasant topics. Among the reasons which would have induced me to add nothing to my letter the 1st of lat month its would have been of some weight that by silence I should avoid the repetition of a style and manner which seem to have produced a personal excitement.As you are willing to admit the authenticity of Lord Dorcester's speech we will with your approbation reserve for a future discussion on what occasion and to what degree an explanation may be required by the government of the United States from a foreign minister.I selected only one passage of that speech because in it was concentrated the real object of the whole; which was to declare an expectation that Great Britain would be at War with the united States in the course of the present year. and if she were to cause the warriors to draw a line. this is the undisguised sense of the governor-general unaffected by the preliminary words which you have thought proper to quote. It is your own interpretation. For so far are you from contradicting my assertion that Lord Dorchester fostered and encouraged in the Indians hostile dispositions towards us that you continue the greater part of your remaining observations to vindicate his persuasion and your own that the principal aggression leading to hostility proceeded from the United States and to suggest many others of the same tendency upon which you would not dilate.I shall not shrink Sir from your charges.1st Notwithstanding the territory upon which certain inhabitants of Vermont are presented in your letter of the 5th of July 1792 to have trespassed belong to the United States; yet on the 9th of the same month did my predecessor give you as is admitted positive assurances of the determination to discourage and repress the subject of your complaint. The necessary instructions were accordingly forwarded to that state. On examining your correspondence with my department it does not appear that from the 9th of July 1792 to the 10th of March 1794 upwards of nineteen months our government ever unrdestood from yourself or any authority of his Britannic Majesty that the original dissatisfaction continued. Nor was any discontent heard from that quarter through other channels except what related to outrages upon our own citizens by British subjects. Then indeed thirty days after the hostile tribes of Indians had been assembled by Lord Dorchester at Quebec you renew your remonstrance. Although it cannot be by any means believed that this was written in order to ausher in the intelligence which soon after arrived on his speech; ye tit is difficult to account for so long an interval under the circumstances supposed. Nor ought my answer although delayed for fifty days until the 19th of April 1794 to be constured into an assent to any charge since at the end of that period having been disappointed as my letter shews in one opportunity of information and no other presenting itself we were not in a capacity of contradicting your assertions. However Sir the instructions issued in consequence of your application conveyed positive orders for the correction of what upon examination should be found irregular.2d Among the points to which you intimate that you might have adverted is enumerated the fitting out of two privateers at Charleston South Carolina. Whatever this transaction might have been it probably occurred at the commencement of the war and before the existence of the war was communicated to our government by any of the powers engaged. Had such a transaction been known to the President in time you can well judge from his actual conduct what he would then have done. His proclamation on the 2nd of April 1793 his call upon the state governors on the 26th of the same months to co-operate with him in the work of impartiality and peace; the system of rules which he established and which were imparted to you are unerring indications of the spirit of those measures on which he had determined. He suppressed the consular courts which attempted to pass sentences of condemnation on captures; he restored several vessels to British owners; prosecutions have been instituted against the violaters of neutrality. In a word Sir what has been required under the sanction of the law of nations which had not been fulfilled? How many things have been spontaneously done to evince our impartiality? Let me request you to review my predecessor’s letters to you of April 22 May 15 June 5 August 7 8 25 September 5 and 12 1793: and to say if more could be well expected from us? After such demonstrations it might have been hoped that the equipment of these two privateers would not rise again in the shape of a charge. But the letter of the 5th of June being conceived of itself to be satisfactory is here inserted.In the letter which I had the honour of writing you on the 15th of May in answer to your several memorials of the 8th of that month I mentioned that the President reserved for further consideration a part of the one which related to the equioment of two privateers in the port of Charleston. The part alluded to was that wherein you express your confidence that the executive government of the United States would pursue measures for represeeing such practices in the future and for restoring to their rightful owners any captures which such privateers might be bring into the ports of the United States.The Presidentafter a full investigation of this subject and the most mature consideration has charged me to communicate to you that the first part of this application is found to be jest and that effectual measures are taken for preventing repetitions of the act therin complained of; but that the latter part desiring restitution of the prizes is understood to be inconsistent with the rules which govern such cafes and would therefore be unjustifiable towards the other partyThe principal agents in this transaction were French citizens. Being within the United States at the moment a war broke out between their own and another country they determine to go in its defence; they purchase arm and equip a vessel with their own money man it themselves receive a regular commission from their nation depart out of the United states and then commence hostilities by capturing a vessel If under these circumstance the commission of the captors was valid the property according to the laws of war was by the capture transferred to them; and it would be an aggression on their nation for the United states to rescue it from them whether on the high seas or on coming into their ports. If the commission was not valid and consequently the property not transferred by the laws of war to the capture then the case would have been cognizable in our courts of admiralty and the owners might have gone thither for redress. So that on neither supposition would the executive be justifiable in interposing.With respect to the United States the transaction can in no wise be imputed to them. It was in the first moment of the warߝin one of the their most distant port.ߝbefore measures could be provided by the government to meet all the cases which such a state of things was to produce impossible to have known and therefore impossible to have been prevented by that government.The moment it was known the most energetic orders were sent to every state and port in the union to prevent a repetition of the accident. On a suggestion that citizens of the United States had taken part in the act one who was designated was instantly committed to prison for prosecution; one or two others have been since named and committed in like manner; and should it appear that there were still others no measures would be spared to bring them to justice. The President had even gone farther; He has required as a reparation of their breach of respect to the United States that the vessels so armed and equipped shall depart from our ports.You will see Sir in these proceedings of the President unequivocal proofs of the line of strict right which he means to pursue. The measures now mentioned are taken in justice to the one part; the ulterior measure of seizing and restoring the prizes is declined in justice to the other; and the evil thus early arrested will be of very limited effects; perhaps indeed soon disappear altogether.As to the permission from the governor of South Carolina ??? ??? departures of ??? privateers ??? ??? you may assure yourself of a proper inquiry; and I take the liberty of requesting any evidence which you may have of it3. With so many direct proofs in your hands of the opinion constantly maintained by our government against the legality of captures in general made by illegal privateers it is not easily explained why the validity of those before the 5th of June 1793 should be argued from a refusal to restore them. The above received letter of that date neither affirms nor disaffirms their validity; but declines the granting of restitutions being inconsistent with the rules which govern such cases. Those ruled are That if the commission be good the capture is good; if the commission be bad the capture is bad; but whether it be good or bad is not decided; it being enough to prove that the transaction for the reasons assigned can in no wise be imputed to the united States. But if captures of this kind prior to the 5th of June 1792 do really amount (as is conceived by some) to no very considerable value this would of itself lessen the importance of the insinuation.4th. The secretary of war has undertaken to ascertain the precise state of the privateers le Petit Democrate and la Carmagnole and the result will be communicated to you. In the mean time it is a matter of some surprise that vessels whose single employment and profit must consist in cruizing on the ocean should have remained in the port of New-York during the whole winter and probably up to the date of your letter (May 22d 1794) May it not be presumed that their activity has been checked by the intervention of the government? But sir if they have not been dismantled your letter brings the first notice of the omission.5th. It is true that the sale of prizes made by French cruizers has not been prohibited in the United States and that our treaty with France has been so interpreted as not to contemplate a freedom to sell. The next resort was to the law of nations; which was scrupulously searched by the executive with the pure desire of discovering truth and justice to all. Upon this as on many other occasions the civilians differ; Vattel declaring That a privateer may carry his prize into a neutral port and there freely sell it; Martens affirming the same doctrine if it has not been otherwise regulated by treaty; and others opposing it. in this sxhism among the writersit was resolved by the President of the United States to impose no restraint upon those sales; and to refer them; as affairs of legislation to congress at the earliest moment of their session. Thus much has been observed not as my final anser but merely to introduce an assurance that I will follow you in the main discussion whensoever you shall bring it forward in detail.6th. Undoubtedly sir you have been misinformed that the vessels of France have been permitted to depart from our ports notwithstanding the embargo. As the history of the executive proceedings is neither long nor entangled it shall be frankly stated to you. As soon as the embargo was laid expresses and advice boats were dispatched to notify the officer of the customs and revenue cutters and all others concerned in its execution. The resolution imposing it involved all foreign nations; the instructions from the United States favoured no nation directly or indirectly. A French snow La Camille which had descended the river Delaware as low as New-Castle on her voyage was stopped by an officer of the United States; and the President adhering to perfect impartiality could not think himself justified to gratify the Minister of the French Republic with a passport. Passports being kept under the special view of the President were issued only after his examinatino of each case and the total number of them does not exceed twenty-six. Among them was one to yourself; one to an agent who was sent to the West-Indies upon a business connected with the late captures and condemnation in various British courts of admiralty; one to a citizen whose vessel was under trial in Bermuda and who was anxious to forward the British instructions of the 8th January 1794 with a hope of rescuing her from confiscation; one to the friends of Joshua Barney then in Jamica; twenty for the accomodation of several unfortunate inhabitants of St. Domingo to some of whome our government was advancing money for their support and who could no longer endure their separation from home; one to some other persons in peculiar circumstances desirous of returning to the West-Indies; and in the last instance one to the Minister of the French Republic. If therefore by any other passport or permission; the embargo has been relaxed it was unauthorized by the President and unlawful. The distance of Hampton Road from this city being more than three hundred miles the officers of government resident here could not learn at the moment what was passing there. No intelligence of an official nature of any real importance. No complaint from any other foreign minister or any othe rpseron has since reached us. If Sir you should happen to possess the information I ask it as a favour of you to designate who granted the permission and under what circumstances the French vessels left that road? An investigation however has been and shall be pursued on our part without delay. If the law has been violated it shall be vindicated; but a violation of law is very remote from a permission of the government.7th. The uniformly unfriendly treatment which the British officers are said to have experienced in the United States cannot be answered until it shall be more explicitly defined. Did this treatment break forth in words or actions not cognizable by law? If so no complaint can be offered to government. Or in words or action which were so cognizable? Our courts are free to foreigners against citizens and independent of influence. To yourself let me appeal that on the representations which you thought proper to lay before the President in relation to the British consul at Baltimore the British consul at Norfolk and the commander of the DȰdalus frigate the necessary measures were promptly adopted; the result has been transmitted to you and no objection has been returned. Nor was the government backward in its interference in the late affair of Philadelphia. And these eing the only occurrences of the kind within my knowledge i trust that no example can be produced of government refusing to extend its protection on every seasonable occasion.8th. The events at Newport in Rhode-Island are accurately detailed in the proceedings which I have the honour of enclosing to you. Within the limits of the present letter I cannot do more; as it might be an useless talk to detain you with remarks when non of them might be adapted to the animadversions which you mediate. It is enough therefore for me to engage that these animadversions whenever they shall appear shall receive particular attention.Although Sir your charges against the United States are sketched only; the impression which may have been intended cannot be counteracted too soon by such general elucidations as at a future day may be more minutely unfolded. But let these facts be as they will; are they indicative of a hostile disposition in the United States and ought they ultimately to produce a state of war? This is not the place for us to retort our complaints. But compare them with the whole of your catalogue; and say what may our feeling be? Yet we prefer peace.9th. As Lord Dorchester's endeavour to stir up the Indians against us is without justification; so is the expedition of Governor Simcoe without pretext.That you have received no intelligence of such an event having actually occurred leaves room to conjecture that you may not be without intelligence of it having been designed; and that it has therefore probably taken place. But you insist that much will depend on the place intended for the fort. Let the point allotted for it on the Miami be unknown; the place is for our immediate purpose adequatley market out by eing on the river. A single glance of the eye over the map proves that its source is within the limits of the United States. In its whole length it is flanked on each side by our territory. Its very mouth is to the Southward of our line as recognised by our treaty with his Britannic Majesty. On no part therefore of the rapids can a fort be built but within out country.This being fixed your argument is that if the fort be for the purpose of protecting subjects of his majesty residing in districts dependent on the fort of Detroit or of preventing that fortress from being straitened by the approach of the American army; the principle of statu quo until the final arrangement of the point in discussion between the two countries shall be concluded will strictly apply.To change by hostile movements the condition of a thing concerning which a treaty is opened not being consonant with the spirit of adjustment the principle of statu quo has been generally adopted. The nearest point of the rapids to Detroit cannot be less than fifty miles. They have never been considered they never could be considered as appending to Detroit. But you proceed and say tha tthe proposed assumption of territory may depend on districts which depend on Detroit. It is too obvious to dwell upon the remark that if Detroit which lies within the United States becomes the first station from which a district may be generated one encroachment may beget another ad infinitum. It will however be very acceptable to understand with accuracy how much of our territory towards the Miami was actually possessed by the military establishment of Detroit at the time of peace. I mention the military establishment; because if any subjects of his Britainnic majesty reside beyond the line of actual possess they are as being within our limits under our jurisdiction.To prevent the fortress of Detroit from being straitened by the approach of the American army is either a new modification of the preceding idea or founded upon a untenable suspicion. For the question must recur are the rapids an appendage to Detroit? Were they connected with it at the peace? If convenience only were to be consulted and a wide range of unsettled territory by being suitable to the momentary circumstances of one nation is to be transferred for that reason alone from another which is the true proprietor we might even then controvert the conveniency of the rapids to Detroit. If right be consulted our right is complete. Is then our territory to be thus seized? Nay more sir I am authorized to say to you explicitly that the American army has no instructions to straiten or annoy that post; and that if the descent on the rapids was dictated by this consideration it ought to be discontinued without cause.I have the honour Sir to be with great respectYour most obedient servant EDM. RANDOLPH.Mr. Hammond MinisterPlenipotentiary of his Britannic Majesty.True Copy. GEO. TAYLOR jun.,Anglo-American relations ID376,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,11,inform,Message from General Washington to Congress May 21.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesI lay before you certain information whereby it would appear that some encroachment as about to be made on our territory by an Officer and party of British troops. Proceeding upon a supposition of the authenticity of this information although of a private nature I have caused the representation to be made to the British Minister a copy of which accompanies this Message.It cannot be necessary to comment upon the very serious nature of such an encroachment nor to urge that this new state of things suggests the propriety of placing the united States in a posture of effectual preparation for an event which notwithstanding the endeavours making to avert it may y circumstances beyond our controul be forced upon us. G. Washington.By a letter from Mr. Randolph the American Secretary of State to Mr Hammond the information alluded to we find to be That Governor Simcoe had gone to the foot of the Rapids of teh Miami followed by three companies of a British regiment in order to build a fort thereߝWhich Mr. Hammond in his answer rather qualifies than denies.In the debate in Congress on taking off the embargo several members said they had voted for the embargo merely as a part of a general plan of retaliation upon Great Britain; but that as the more effential parts of that plan particularly the prohibiting of all commercial intercourse between America and Great Britain had been over-ruled the embargo was injurious only to the subjects of teh United States and therefore ought to be taken off.In Philadelphia and several other ports the masters and mates of American ships held meetings and published resolutions declaring that they would not put to sea until they could be assured that their flag would be respected and their persons protected from such indignities as many of them had lately experienced. This they did after the embargo was at an end.,Anglo-American relations ID377,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,07,18,inform,Philadelphia June 3. [Authentic.]Copy of a letter from General Wilkins to Col. C. Biddl dated Pittsburgh 23d May 1794.I this moment received yours of the 17th inst. I arrived about fifteen minutes ago from Le Boeuf and left the detachment there well covered and in good spirits. They have built under my directions two small block-houses picketed in which I think will render them sufficiently strong until the reinforcement goes under Capt. Denny.The Indians I have conversed with still continue of the opinion that the British will make an opposition to the establishment at Presque Isle. There arrived at Cuslawago while I was there an Indian from Sandusky where he had been left by the Senecas last fall sick;ߝhe says the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada M'Kee and Elliot the Indian agent (the two last refugees from this country) were visiting all the Indian towns in that quarter and exciting them to continue their opposition to the Americans and assuring them of support from their father the British monarch. He further adds that they were ready for fighting Gen. Wayne the moment he moved; and that the British were erecting garrisons at the Miami river. He confirms the accounts of the other Indians that they were determined to oppose the establishment at Presque Isle.There were in the Port of Philadelphia on the 25th of May.62 Ships 73 Brigs 7 Snows 60 Schooners 42 Sloops. 244In the House of Representatives of the United States Thursday June 5 1794.The House according to the order of the day resolved itself into a committee of the whole House on the report of the Committee to whom was referred the remonstrance of the People west of the Alleghany Mountains relative to the navigation of the river Mississippi and after some time spent therein Mr. Speaker resumed the chair and Mr. Trumbull reported that the Committee according to order had the same report under consideration and come to a resolution thereupon which he delivered in at the Clerk's table where the same was twice read and agreed to by the House as follows:Resolved That as it appear from the communications of the Executive that the right of the United States to the free navigation of the Mississippi is now the subject of negociation with the Court of Spain; and as it is the interest of the United States and every part thereof to come to an amicable adjustment of the right in that mode rather than resort to any means constitutionally belonging to the Legislature no farther proceeding should be had on the said remonstrance during the present session of Congress.Extract from the Journal.,Anglo-American relations
