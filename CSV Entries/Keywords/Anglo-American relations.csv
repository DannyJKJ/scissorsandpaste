ID48,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,persuade,The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world.Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.ID68,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,09,inform,We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May from which the following is extracted:–Quebec May 20.We hear late accounts from Niagara mention that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States that they had now raised an army to take their own for Niagara and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on and that they would punish those that should interfere.It was also said that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited by that event.We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them to think of accepting any more from that quarter and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic before they testify their impatience that national treaties like private agreements are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive.[As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.]May 24.The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington have received letters from the Captian Kendrick dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them that he passed the winter preceding on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had been at Nootka and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America.[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last (see Glasgow Intelligence p. 424) and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.]ID94,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,22,inform,Philadelphia June 1.We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of Penn sylvania prosecutions have been instituted against John Singleterry and Gideon Henfield charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the United States entering on board the armed schooner Genet in the service of France and with others on board the said schooner capturing several vessels the property of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said subjects contrary to the Laws of Nations and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States and his said Britannic Majesty.The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of Philadelphia to take their trial at the next Circuit Court of the United States.A letter from Charleston dated May 10 says Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived here from Augusta in Georgia who informs that six of the Creek Towns with a number of Cherokees had declared war against the United States and were actually marching under the command of Bowles and Gilpin at attack the frontiers.ID365,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,08,30,persuade,Each day brings additional strength to the report of a rupture with America. The representtations which have been very forcibly urged by the American Minister Mr. Pickney include various topics of complaint. Amongst these are the withholding of the poste of Niagara Detroit &c. in violation of the treat of 1783; the exciting of of the Creek and other Indians to make compensation for the property seized by the armies under Lord Cornwalis & in the Southern States according to stipulation; the seizure of American ships bound to France; the impressing of American citizens to man our fleets; and finally the sullen silence which the British Minister is alledged to have uniformly maintained on the subject of the claims made by the Republic.The American Minister has however so little hope of efficacy from these representations that he has ordered in his tradesmen's bills and made every other preparation for an abrupt departure.Not withstanding this alarming aspect of affairs we still must hope that no consequences subversive of the pacific system at present subsisting between American and Great Britain will ensue; for ill-judged and ignorant indeed of the true interests of his country must that Briton be (whatever his rank) who would advise another American war –a war which reasoning of the future by the sorrowful experience of the past can only serve to increase the sum and to swell the catalogue of human woes.ID371,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,12,13,inform,Extracts from the New-York Daily Advertiser.Pittsburgh Sept. 7.SUNDAY last arrived an express in this town from the commissioners who were sent to treat with the Indians: he had left the commissioners on this side of Lake Erie that day eight days. They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands.By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the ???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place.New York Sept. 17.A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event proved their opinion to be just.According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467.Philadelphia Sept. 21.The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road–O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens!Sept. 25.Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward.We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights.New-York Sept. 28.Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant.You request I would endeavour to give you a particular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in a destitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there.The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead.The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others.The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day.The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush-Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations.The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now.By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers–And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush.October 2.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28.The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality.We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy.Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious–its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off.Philadelphia Oct. 7.Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart.Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore.Winchester Sept. 20.Extract of a letter from our correspondent at ??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4.Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The ???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes.From the same dated Sept. 14.On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court-House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile.New-York Oct. 16.Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–WE lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.
