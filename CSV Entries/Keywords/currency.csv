No less than 300 ton of them were contracted for by Congress in the year 1787 to be coined at the rate of 50 ton per annum ; the contracters were also bound down to make them all of the famous Jersey copper. They are a little larger than the British halfpence. No British copper no passes in the United States;–silver and gold coins of all nations however pass cur rent. The congress have not yet ordered a silver coinage.,currency ID92,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,14,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesIT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated:You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed.It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities.I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session.In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed.It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy.The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced.Gentlemen of the House of RepresentativesI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesI content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice.The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness.Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.,currency ID119,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,11,21,inform,Canada Papers.Montreal Oct. 5. On the afternoon of Saturday last the specie seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat amounting to upward of 12000 dollars arrived at his Majesty's cash-office here under the escort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's.At length we have authentic accounts relating to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very important as many ex parte details have been published - his taking Fort William by storm making all the partners of the North West Company prisoners &c. ; but the cause of the expe dition has never been explained. The Canadian Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– Mr Robert Semple the Governor-General The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River towards the close of the year 1815 took possession of two establishments belonging to the North West Company which had obtruded themselves on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. The North West traders then altered their route going into the Upper Country by circuitous ways by which much delay took place ; and in order to try Mr Semple they sent two cartloads of provisions by the former track in June last with a guard of fifty men ; the advance twenty-two of the number fell in with one of the natives whom they took forward with them to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed within four miles of the settlement ; they were perceived by the Governor and were attacked by a party from the garrison consisting of about thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place stated on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this account that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's conducting the expedition we do not justify nor indeed can we form any opinion on the subject without further authentic details ; it is however but justice to say that the Hudson's Bay Company have rights and are a chartered Company ; the North West Traders though we believe a most respectable body are only an Association of Merchants.,currency ID123,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope dated 15th Nov. 1817: –The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth White lying at anchor off Robin Island with about 120 tons of oil on board was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment and convicts about 12 in number i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts who after securing the hatches &c. obtained possession of the ship and in the same instant cut the cables loosed the sails and favoured by a strong S. E. wind succeeded in carrying her off at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day.By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier Brash laden with Government stores for Ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last having struck on the reef Roan de Nova in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved.A letter from Halifax dated the 27th Nonember says – Colonel Bouchette Surveyor- General of Lower Canada with Captain Campbell of the 60th regiment and Mr Bouchette jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes.Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard–On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock- yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11,currency ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States.

The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble.
