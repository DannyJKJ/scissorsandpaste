These emigrants are we believw to be carried out at a very small cost to themselves the largest portion of the passage money being paid by Government out of the land revenue of New South Wales which is exclusively appropriated towards the encouragement and promotion of emigration–the objects in view being as well the relief of those districts in this country which are suffering from the want of employment and subsistence as by the introduction into that colony of a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant families and individuals the promotion of the moral welfare of the colonists generally. The emigrants will we believe receive employment in New South Wales as farm-servants shepherds overseers &c. We had a brief inspection of the Midlothian on Monday afternoon and found it to be a very fine vessel fitted up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon from Leith to the Isle of Skye.,land speculation ID276,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,04,03,inform,Colonel Wyndham has sent out a commission to Canada to purchase an estate of 10000 acres and intends furnishing the same assistance to persons desirous of emigrating from his estates to Australia and Canada as was given by the late Earl of Egremont.–Morning Herald.,land speculation ID277,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1839,05,11,inform,New Zealand.–A vessel selected to carry out emigrants to New Zealand under the auspices of a company formed in this country will sail in about a fortnight.
