He has settled at Port Jackson and has leave to teach the children of some of your nation to read and write in your own way. The place is much improved since you ahve had any letters form it as there was no person without a habitation and being in some order when he left it. Except wearing apparel very little is wanting but business ; but you may thank the Dutch at Batavia for it as they have brought several useful things there. The last crops of corn and the garden grounds were in very good condition : and what makes the settlement more convenient one of the people who came in the first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use and ornament as the clay is equally good as that of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see so many people without hats or shoes and houses without windows and full of wicker and rush furniture which is used in the place of almost every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful supply of coal and iron hardly any utensils would be wanting. Your nephew has two children and says all that are born there are very healthy and more born than are buried or executed of grown people. The Christians Church was quite finished before he came away ; and he thinks if there were enough of your people they might have a place to themselves. The farthest of the lines was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was reported when he came away that as soon as more troops and a new Governor comes over they would go farther than ever up the country when some valuable discovers are expected to be made ; they have a gum which may be used for gum arabic which is veyr useful. He expects several of your people will go from Batavia to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way for sending old clothes is not yet found out. Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited that it is not worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as little is said about it there as if it was as far off as Europe &c. &c.,religion ID42,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Account of a singular Sect called Shaking QuakERS in America.IN the United States of America there are some Jews and various denomications of Christians –as Roman Catholics Lutherans Presbyterians Congregationalists Baptists Quakers Dunkers Moravians Deists Methodists Newlights Sandimanians Universalists and Shaking Quakers; all of whom are allowed to perform religious worship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences.The Shaking Quakers are a new sects that sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman called the Elect Lady with twelve disciples all of which were said to be Europeans were the founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew thousands of people after them who pretended they were visited with power from on high to work miracles heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils and speak in unknown languages.This Lady risided in the north-westerly part of the State of New York where she began to instil her tenets into some of the people there:– afterwards she rambled from place to place promulgating her religion and gaining proselytes in New England and elsewhere:–she engrossed the kingdom of heaven to herself and followers to the seculsion of all others.She pretended her mission was immediately from heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect –could speak in seventry-two unknown languages in which she conversed with those that had departed this life–that there had not been a true church upon earth since the days of the Apostles until her's was erected–that both the living and the dead must be saved in by and through her –must confess their sins unto her and procure her parson or they could not be saved;–that that she gathered her church from both earth and hell as every person that had died since the time of the Apostles until her church was set up was damned and that they were ocntinually making intercession to her for salvation which was the occasion of her talking to them in those unknown tongues.Those that entered into her church were obliged to confess their sins and deliver up their jewels rings necklaces buckles watches &c. to be disposed of as she thought fit.It has been reported that some of these confessions proved very beneficial; for some of her church members owned they had stolen things that had been laid to innocent persons.When these people carry on their worship they pretend to praise the Lord by singing dancing jumping turning round falling down tumbling &c. and in the mean time some will be trembling groaning sighing and sobbing: whilst others are preaching praying exhorting &c. others will be clapping their hands shouting hallowing screaming and making such a hideous noise that it may be heard at a great distance and will often affrighten the spectators.They often dance three hours without intermission and when any of them are tired of praising the Lord that way they are whipped by others to make the worship go on briskly. They dance till they are much emaciated ; the young women grow pale appear like ghosts or apparitions or like deserters from a church-yard –if I may use the sailor's phrase.They make no use of the Eucharist or of water baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars fighting and swearing ; they use the plain language and cry–yea and nay instead of yes and no: but the other Quakers do not approve of all their tenets.At particular times they labour very hard at their respective occupations and are very careful that no time is spent in idleness.They pretend they hold a correspondence with the saints and angels and that they frequently see and converse with the spirits of their departed friends.Many of them refuse to be with their wives because they suppose they are part of the hundred and forty and four thousand mentioned in the Revelations that were redeemed from the earth and were not defiled with women.They hold that they have already been made partakers of the first resurrection and that on them the second death will have no power.They do not allows the instrumental music in their churches because they suppose it was ceremonial and is abolished;–but pretend that they carry on their worship by the immediate power and influence of the Holy Ghost and that they have scripture warrents for their practice a[?]– Sing unto God–Praise the Lord in the dance; –O clap your hands all ye people;–Shout on to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down before the Lords&c.,religion ID48,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,persuade,The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world.Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular.,religion ID73,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,19,entertain,Court of Chancery. TheKing at the relation of theBishopofLondon versusAndersonandGipps.On the 18th of June 1692 the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary in New England to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees and the management under the trust was by the will committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit in which the city and a great number of other persons were parties for the single and indeed novel purpose of knowing whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence) the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom or to some other of his Majesty's colonies to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps and likewise the city of London must be paid their costs.,religion ID101,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,02,07,inform,The Quakers of America have addressed an humble Representation to the Legislative Body of that country praying that exhibitions Preludes Interludes yea all lewds and stage-plays may be discountenanced pointing out their pernicious tendency in corrupting the morals of the People.,religion ID141,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Extract of a letter from William Hunt esq. To H. Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better,religion ID220,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1831,06,04,inform,The brig Stirling Castle Captain Fraser sailed from Greenock on Wednesday morning for Sidney New South Wales having on board the Rev. J. D. Lang minister of the Scots Church in Sydney and two other Presbyterian Ministers ordained to new stations in that colony ; also three Professors intended for which a liberal Government grant has been obtained. There are also on board above 40 respectable mechanics with their families consisting chiefly of joiners masons and others required for the building of the College and a good many of whom are fromthis town making the number of passengers in all about 140 of whom above 20 and cabin passengers.,religion ID257,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,04,09,inform,Sir George Clerk.–As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated we believe upon good authority that he accounts for this course of proceeding by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill.Burn's Monument.–We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument which has too long remained in an unfinished state to the surprise of strangers and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod which he has generously devoted to that purpose is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect therefore that the work will forthwith be commenced and if a few pounds are still wanted we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking.Annuity Tax.–We understand that deputations from several places in the country are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon of Wallhouse M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not will be most numerously attended.Law of Scotland.–The prizes given by Professor Bell for the greatest proficiency in the examinations were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish 25 India Street in the senior and to William Spence 31 Broughton Place in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser James Gilchrist James Mason James Scott in the senior class; James Oliver David Gale John R. Banks James Charles Murray Wm. M'Naughton in the junior.Kilwinning March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday the 22d March and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson of Dalry preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns of Stewarton ordained and the Rev D. Ronald of Saltcoats gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr Tait of Barrhead introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister.Presentation of Plate.–Mr A. S. Walker late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England at Uttoxeter in Staffordshire was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return just published we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835 was 12527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12527 there were 5597 adult males 3866 females and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England 3067 Ireland 7108 Scotland 2127 From Newfoundland Nova Scotia &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada 2297 Upper Canada 9800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec 13 Returned to the United Kingdom 117 Removed to the United States 300 –12527But besides those who went to Canada 16749 landed at New York raising the whole number of emigrants to 29376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork with 48 persons on board passengers and crew of whom 41 were lost.From another part of the Report we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk.Ulster Railway.–Length 36 miles from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600000 in 12000 shares of which t393000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450000; the expected income is t93000 of which t67800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310 320 and 570 yards in length.East Lothian Railway.–We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh by Haddington and Tranent which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland from the German ocean to the Atlantic its chances of success are vastly increased.Dundee and Arbroath Railway.–The Committee's report on this railway has reached us but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100000 divided into 4000 shares which is all subscribed but authority is taken to raise t40000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88900 by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16912 goods t14654 from both t31566. There are no tunnels no inclined planes and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000 scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99844.Statute Labour Acts.–It appears from the votes of the House of Commons that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated that by the present act for this county proprietors of land and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden on account of the coaches chaises gigs or saddle horses they may keep though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards though it is stated with confidence that were the occupiers of land included beneficial consequences would follow.–East- Lothian Correspondent.Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society.– The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton Esq. one of the Honorary Members President of the Society in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers and various influential individuals in Leith and is well deserving of encouragement as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds we understand are in a prosperous state.Hay and Straw.–In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted we have made due inquiry and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers or to favour either party at the expense of the public.The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant dated the 6th of April 1836 a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland viz. a blue cornet flag with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.Heriot's Hospital.–At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital on Thursday the 7th instant the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel amounting to t935 was accepted and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel which was described by Councillor Grant and others as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants who may be thus classed :–Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital or any other institution 12 Those who have received benefit for one child 13 Do. for two children 6 Do. for three children 5 Do. for five children 1 37In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference first to children of widows (being poor) then to those who have never received benefit afterwards those who have had only one child in and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children and one for an orphan out of the above number and it is therefore probable considering the large population of Edinburgh that it is not sufficiently known that George Heriot in his will expressly points out the fatherless and poor being children of burgesses and freemen as the objects of his charity–hence if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases the Governors in filling up the vacancies may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy.–On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy delivered by Dr Thomas Murray in Elder Street Chapel was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were on the motion of one of the members of committe voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray Mr A. G. Hunter merchant was called to the Chair and some conversation having taken place the committee of management who had necessarily been self-elected were confirmed by the meeting in their office and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper some evening next week on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate.It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve Esq. of Newington Cottage died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance and his death will be long and deeply regretted.Rare Sights in London.–A young Scottish Miss who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt returned the other day by one of the steamers and was met on landing by various members of her family who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden and all the wild beasts in't!The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet Richard Macbeth Othello Shylock and King John investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar distinct and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was as usual crowded in every part and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for appeared in front of the stage and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:–Ladies and Gentlemen–I now stand before you for the last time this season but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy but a grateful heart to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive appears next in Aberdeen where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there we are told are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey from the Theatre Royal Haymarket makes her appearance here on Monday first.On Wednesday evening Mr John G. Moxey baker Castle Street was entertained at supper in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern Waterloo Place by a party of friends of about fifty in number previous to his leaving this country for America to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey.Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.–The Presbytery of Cupar at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville and Walter Malcolm Esq. Edinburgh to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken on the grounds as we understand that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election though consistent with the letter is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill Esq. that when the commissions came to be attested he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect.The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one who during a long and useful life has done so much for the cause of literature and religion the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton and even the general church-going community are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence of the pious and heartfelt warmth and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology as Professor to the General Associate Synod and afterwards to the Associate Synod he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures and of an unwearied research into the Natural History and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture–will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning and of his Oriental investigations and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant.Public Dinner to Professor Dick.–On Tuesday last the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert Esq. in the Chair and Alexander Gordon jun Esq. croupier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper Esq. of West Craigs J. R. Laing Esq. jun of Dunkenny Samuel Wordsworth jun. Esq. W.S. Dr Malcolm James Miller Esq. and George Rennie Esq.– Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson Spittal Knox and Aitken Mr Ferguson surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon Esq. Secretary to the Highland Society of Scotland ; A. T. Blackwood Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick senior &c. The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal toasts drank the chairman in a neat and appropriate speech proposed the health of Professor Dick to whom the present meeting had assembled to do honour and who at once commanded their esteem as a member of society and their admiration as a man of talent which toast was drank with the greatest enthusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland Patrons of the Edinburgh Veterinary College which was followed by a variety of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs were sung and the conviviality of the evening was kept up until a late hour.Royal Infirmary–We understand that the Stewards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the Royal Infirmary have by their judicious arrangements in the management of the ball been enabled to pay over to the trustees of that institution (after deducting all expenses) the sum of t432 7s. 8d. The managers of the Infirmary as well as the public at large are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen who acted as stewards upon that occasion for their valuable extertions particularly at the present time in support of this great and useful institution for the relief of those labouring under the united calamities of indigence and disease.,religion ID273,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1838,09,22,inform,The King of Prussia and his Catholic Sub- jects.–The German Courier in an article date Berlin 5th instant refers to the late arrests in Posen and accuses the Catholic clergy of stimulating their flocks to revolt.
