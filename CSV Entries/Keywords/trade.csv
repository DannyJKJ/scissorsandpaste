ID1,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1811,08,26,inform,Commerce of Canada.Extract of a letter.The population of Canada in 1760 was reckoned at 62000 souls whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90000l) The imports must have greatly exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas may be rated at 320000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may appear commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population.From 1763 to 1793 the exports may have varied from 120000l. to 300000l. chiefly of wheat furs and peltry. But during the last 18 years they have increased to the surprising sum of 1220963l. 10s. Sterling as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate which cannot be much over or under the truth :-Furs and skims ... 105000 0 Wheat all other grain flour and biscuit 136500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223000 0 Beets and pork 30000 0 Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16000 10 The hulls masts and yards of 28 vessels built in the province ... 84000 0 Total of domestic produce 1131000 0 Sundry goods imported and exported 4780 0 1125780 0Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65183 0 t. 1220963 10The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380000l. Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but we may safely conlude that they will make the total of import as one million Sterling leaving a balance in favour of these provinces which but a few years ago would have appeared incredible. This property is carried by 661 vessels whose tonnage is 143893 navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton being 1359788l. 17s. Sterling which without taking into consideration the charges in Britain will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed exceed 3000000l. Sterling being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom.Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years ago our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants have begun to settle amongst us I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of. ID2,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,01,05,inform,From the Jamaica Royal Gazette. Kingston Sept. 27The ship Nestor belonging to Glasgow seized several months ago by the officers of his Majesty's customs at this port for not being pro vided with a register according to Act of Parliament was condemned at a Court of Vice Admiralty held in Spanish Town on Friday last week. She was sold for 1500L. ID4,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,13,inform,Our latest accounts from the West Indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch.The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade. ID5,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from Quebec June 6.We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the Governor and Council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job.Government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States though we hear of a cargo from New York for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States.My servant is just come home from the baker's where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the Queen.Mr. Davidson one of the Council assured us on Thursday last there was not wheat and flourin the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration. ID7,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk Virginia dated April 2.By Captain Gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi- sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George from Baltimore brought in [?] days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the 30th day of March laden with bread corn; or flour. He also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk with provisions advise them to call at Bermuda. ID8,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,06,inform,THE following extract from a late publication entitled A State of the present Government of the Province of Quebec will give the public some idea of the Canada Bill which has been so much talked of an procrastinated so long and at present pending in Parliament. The work we understand to be the production of Adam Lymburner Esq; set over by the province to negotiate this afair. It is remarkablewithhis former publication for its strong nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all mankind. The security which flows from a free constitution to both political and civil liberty contributes greatly towards bringing forth the powers of the human mind and the encouragement of the industry of people ; but no constitution can be called free where the people are not allowed to participate of the legislative authority by their representatives : This is the great criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural for all British subjects as they know the value of it to struggle for such a valuable right. Great Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her Colonies; and by that means has rendered them more flourishing and prosperous than those of o ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the province of Quebec have from the general tendency of the British government to a mild administration enjoyed a certain degree of civil liberty; yet they have been from the peculiar nature of the system of their government entirely deprived of all political liberty. A more full enjoyment of these essential privileges has been the prayer of their petitions and of those now be fore the House of commons. The objects prayed for may be reduced to the following heads:–1. An elective house of assembly or representatives of the people. 2. That the members of the legislative council receive no salaries as counsellors. 3. That the habeas corpusact and the other laws of England relating to personal libertybe made a part of the constitution. 4. That trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part of the constitution and that nine out of twelve may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws and customs of Canada relative to landed property marriage settlements inheritance and dowers be continued in force in the districts or ID9,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,21,entertain,Curious Anecdote.–A few days ago a stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly Treasurer of the East India Company and desired to speak to him in private ; when the were retired the stranger said to Mr. Sibbly I am lately returned from India I have smuggled goods to the amount of about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon them? Mr. Sibbly smiled and told him That he could receive no such money without the Chairman's permission. Pray then (said the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possible. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. The Company pays for the exclusive privilege of bringing India goods to Europe; the man that deprives them of any part of the advantages they hope to reap from it cannot in my opinion look upon himself as a strictly honest man. Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly the Chairman had not had time to give him an answer ; the stranger notwithstanding gave him a letter including a Bank note of 30l. The sum Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay if he paid any thing. ID15,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,03,inform,From Quebec June 10 we are informed Canada is at present greatly distressed; provisions extremely dear ; beef if good for any thing 5[?] per pound ; mutton 7–d. butter 15d. The parishes in the upper country about Niagara and Montreal have been without bread for four months.There are orders now in town for as many goods for Quebec as will load ten ships; the trade being so exceedingly brisk and the people giving the preference to European goods. ID17,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,07,inform,Yesterday some dispatches were received from St. Kitt's which were brought over in the Matthew Capt. Slegg arrived in the Downs which are dated the 10th of June : they contain an account of all the merchant ships which were then at that island ; that they were nearly full and were fixed to sail from thence the 26th of July and the first of August ; and that the weather continued exceedingly fine. ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.THAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory.About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States.The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami.This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops.In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only!* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum. ID21,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Boston July 31.The building of an Indiaman goes on with rapidity and it is said will be launched about the 20th of October and is pronounced by judges to be an excellent piece of workshmanship. ID27,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,23,persuade,Trade is reviving in America to a very great degree–and such is the appearance of things that in a very few years we may expect to see as firm an union of mercantile interests betweixt this country and the United States as ever subsisted. it is in vain to instil prejudices agian Great Britain in the mind of an American merchant ; he knows this to be the ready money market and he will come to it accordingly. ID33,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock.No doubt Sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present. ID34,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,The American Congress having declared it to be the interest of the United States to encourage agriculture by the cultivation of large plantations and to purchase their merchandize from Europe have in consequence considerably lowered the duties on such merchandize.They have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land instead of two millions which they sold annually in the States; the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the necessity of circulating paper money any longer. ID35,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,advertisement,The MERCHANTS trading to North America Prior to the year 1776ARE desired to meet in the Merchants Hall on Friday the 18th December at 12 o'clock noon on business of importance.Glasgow 12 Dec. 1789. ID36,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Orders are sent to Plymouth for the Echo sloop of war Capt. Drew lately arrived from Newfoundland and now lying in the Sound to get ready for sea and proceed with all possible dispatch to New York–to acquaint the American Merchants that the British ports are open for the importation of American wheat :–It is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour. ID37,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,The West India merchants who were in the utmost anxiety for the arrival of the packet from the West Indies have been most agreebly relieed from their apprehensions. The account of the insurrections in Martinique which we received through France and which has been since confirmed in the National Assembly naturally alarmed them for the British islands. We are happy to inform our readers that the packet brings no intelligence whatever of tumult of insurrections. We have not heard even that the letters bring any account of the conspiracy in Martinique ; a circumstance which can only be accounted for by the little communication which exists between the islands at this season of the year. ID44,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Advices from Baltimore in Maryland say that all the wheat and flour that could be purchased was actually contracted for throughout that fertile province on the 10th of October last for the French market and it was thought the same man–uvre had taken place at New York Philadelphia and Rhode Island. ID48,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,persuade,The Minister is now said to be employed in drawing up two plans which will give rise to very warm debates in Parliament : one is for settling a commercial arrangement between Great Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a constitution to Canada. In feeling the former the Minister will have to contend with strong commercial prejudices; in the latter he will have to encounter religious principles. The British settlers in Canada are comparatively few in number. The great bulk of the Canadians are the descendants of French and are Roman Catholics. The former are Protestants.Fleaury in france and Walpole in England were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Conquests may be made by war but consequence and wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system if the first commercial nation in the world.Besides these considerations the grand secret has been discovered since the present Minister came into power that the best riddance England ever had was of her American Colonies ; because by this means she becomes thoroughly collected at home to oppose every foreign power without the expence and blood of supporting the Americans at the same time that they cannot do without BRitish manufactures in one line or another.Thus they are under the necessity of protecting themselves at the same time that like the rest of Europe they are obliged to resort to our superior mercantile market.Application has been lately made to the Lords of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue some of the new silver coin in aid of the present want of silver for circulation the scarcity of which is much felt by retail traders in particular. ID51,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,By letters from America dated the 5th ult. we learn that wheat is so great a crop all over the Provinces that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago.Two ships laden with American wheat have already arrived at Bristol where the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders are sent to America for wheat of which there has been a prodigious crop. ID52,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,The Americans have refused every kind of supply of grain to the French without the ready money. M. de Mirabeau's scheme of receiving the debt of the United States due to France proves an abortion. ID55,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,In consequence of the order of the Privy council the merchants of Bristol have sent large orders to America for wheat where the crop has been the greatest ever known. ID69,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,08,16,inform,By recent letters from America we learn that the Congress of the nited States after warm debates in both Houses particularly in that of the Representatives passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania.The two new provinces in North America Kentucky and Vermont whose population already is so very considerable were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world the position of which they ??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland Virginia and Pennsylvania and from thence as their views ???tend to every country in Europe. Thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration.Agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of American industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants on account of the remarkable encrease of population and which is still augmenting as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may therefore be deemed in future the granary of this quarter of the globe. ID78,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,By letters from the New York Packet dated October 6 from Philadelphia we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods imported the last season was immense goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for. ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuriesCarlisle Jan. 4. 1792.By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday we are informed that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin were taken by Indians and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany.Extract of a Letter from Patowmack North Amer ca Feb. 7.Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish which he left about two weeks ago and who gave us the following pleasing interesting and important intelligence viz that two days before he left Cat-fish two men arrived there from Licking who informed that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky under General Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance who when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken riding the bullocks dancing &c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott who with the main body were a few miles in the rear he divided them into three divisions advanced and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short but victorious on the side of the volunteers 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott having lost but six men returned to Licking in triumph with most of the cattle stores &c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men but finding his number was insufficient was returning but met a body of 900 volunteers when upon joining him he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful.Our informant further adds that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January at Morgan Town brought by Major Scott's expedition which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps. ID327,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,07,inform,CONGRESS. Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston.

There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained. ID335,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,09,inform,Halifax April 6.The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair.Since the retreat of the f–eral troops under General Harmar the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties.

Kingston Nov. 28.By late arrivals from Hispaniola we learn that the people are in quietness but still armed; and that the Governor who had been suffered to remain but the Intendent only having fled is perfectly submissive to the will of the people.For several days last week the weather at the north side and in some of the Liguanea Mountains blew in most alarming gusts and the cold is said to have been peculiarly sever; some plantain trees have been thrown down but we have yet heard of no material damage.The sloop Resolution has brought into port a part of his Majesty's 10th regiment of foot consisting of a serjeant and 29 privates having received them from on board the ship Commerce Foot from London off the East End on Thursday last the Commerce being destined for Savanna la Mar.Dec. 26. Late on THursday evening his Majesty's ship Amphion Captain Nichols returned to Port-Royal from the Spanish American coast. The Amphion was bound to Carthagena but was prevented by the jealousy of the Spaniards from entering that port. Accounts are said to be received by her that a revolt has taken place amongst the Indians in that quarter and that the Spaniards are demolishing the fortifications throughout the country which it has cost them so much labour and expence to raise; so appre hensive are they of the numbers and force of the malcontents should they possess themselves of any of those strong holds.We learn from Georgia that the treaty with the Indians to negotiate with Commissioners were appointed by the President of the United States has been broken off; and that Mr. M'Gillivray and his warriors have declared that nothing short of a cession of the territory between the rivers St. Mary and Altamaha will satisfy them; adding that no equivalent can be given to the Georgians for relinquishing their claim to the district in question as it is founded in usurpation. The views of Mr. M'Gillivray in making this requisition are evident as it is known that he wishes to establish a sea-port at St Mary's as well for thecommercial emolument as for the civilization of his countrymen by an intercourse with foreign States. ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers too will be able to take their runs so speedily that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby. ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND.The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade.It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces.Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture weresold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded.Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians whoOn this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request.From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk. ID346,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,10,04,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia July 22.Trade is brisk at present from the high prices and great sales of grain to Europe.

The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4.

An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man.But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God.

April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known. ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.–There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million inproduce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar.Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits.I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke.There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand–25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.–Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue. ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some aba???of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated.You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasiondoes not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the ??? river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treat of Holston made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter.I have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities.I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of ???duties on spirits distilled within the United States.These impediments have lessened and are ?ess???din local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law app??? to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting ???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of that system which some cases ???to relax their efficacy. As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of ??? upon processes out of the Courts of the United States and supplementary definition of offence against the constitution and laws of the union ??? of the punishment for such offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition ??? give that satisfaction to foreign nations which ???may sometimes have occasion to require from them.I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations as other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our own peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention ??? expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place if not re??? at the close of the present session.In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dollars; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.The regulation of some provision in the law which establishes the Post Office open to in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that upon the enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy.The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notfied to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans and the circumstance under which they have been made ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced.Gentlemen of the House of RepresentativesI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not engage your early attention.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit your particular notice.The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strength and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness.Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivatino of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.G. WASHINGTON.
