By this plan proposed to his Lordship by Mr. Fraser the settlers are to have perpetual feus of the lands subject to a very moderate quit rent. His Lordship will by this means prevent the threatened emigrations to America and deserve the highest praises of his country.,emigration ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America.[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ].Cobbett's arrival in America&c.On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow.Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.,emigration ID122,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,01,inform,EmigrationThe authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is we are told guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief :Libson Nov. 4We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations.the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at Amsterdam last August.But we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :–We passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in America what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe.We promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail.These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for after 62 days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into Belem near Lisbon.Long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal.The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance.Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends. In July a Hamburgh ship with 106 Swiss passengers was at Lisbon in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships and if they reach their destination they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.It would be a desirable thing for papers in countries where these emigrations are excited to insert the article relative to the charter party given above in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo.,emigration ID125,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Irish Emigrants. New York Nov. 27.Nothing scarcely can be conceived more distressing than the situation of an unfriended stranger arrived here from across the Atlantic without the means of helping himself and without even enough of acquaintance with the men and things about him to enable him to judge what path he should take to secure him the miseries of absolute want. Such however is actually the situation of hundres who annually land on our shores. To provide for those forlorn beings several attempts have been made by associations of humane individuals here but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising as that of which an account here follows: –At a meeting of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen held at Harmony Hall on Tuesday the 25th instant for the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emigrants; Andrew Morris Chairman WM. Sampson Secretary ;Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett the circular previously issues on this subject was read by the Secretary : –Circular It is a sentiment long felt and often expressed that something should be undertaken on behald of the emigrants who flock to these shores.Without any fixed destination they remain in the sea port until beocming victims of bad counsel and bad example they lose the pure and honest energies with which they left their native land and suffer worse than shipwreck in their moral qualities.The Government of this great Republic is well aware of the advantage to be derived from so great a mass of laborious industry when usefully directed and employed–and of adding to the nation's strength men whose attachment to the institutions of this country is assured by so many ties. But it is in the order of things that some of the friends particularly the countrymen of these emigrants who have been some time established and known should come forward to attest the necessity and guarantee the solidity of the enterprise.If his has not been done sooner it is because every advance in social improvement must come in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion and the voice of the times that now speak.It has been remarked that among the lands nows open for sale and settlement there are some tracks particularly in the Illionois territory where the Irish emigrant with the instruments to which his hands are accustomed and in a climate congenial to his habits might procure to himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and in a few years be able to repay with gratitude the benefits conferred on him.We whose names are undersigned have met to consult upon the means of promoting some establishment that might be a rallying point for the distressed and give to the wanderer a habitation and a home. We have thought of no better way than to address by this circular the friends and well wishers of Ireland who co-operation might give most weight to the measure and to submit whether it might not be advisable to join all our efforts and petition Congress early in the ensuing session for a grant of a suitable track upon a credit of 14 or 15 years subject to such conditions and modifications as the Government may see most fitting.to the Government we would offer no deceptive delusive or precarious motive rather chusing to make its wisdom benignity and patriotism the anchor of our hope.We request of our if you approve of our sentiment and of our project to advance and promote it by your best endeavours ; either by forming organized associations or by obtaining individual signatures to a petition to the effect stated. We have not yet been able to digest a plan and have rather chosen to make this humble beginning in hopes that we should soon receive additional light upon the subject from cor respondence we solicit. We shall nevertheless proceed to investigate the subject and challenge the co-operation of good and respectable men and request of you to do the same.You will please address your answers and any future correspondence to Mr James Moffit No. 15.

Mullaney John Meyher William James M'Neven Cornelius Heeny Matthew Carroll Robert Swanton James Moffit. New York Nov 18 1817Mr Emmet then stated that he had been requested by the gentlemen who called this meeting to explain the objects for which it was convenued ; that it could not be necessary to expatiate before those he was now addressin on the situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ireland ; it was at present one of unqualified misetry partly occasioned by their local oppressions and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; it compelled them to fly to these shores in such numbers and under the pressure of so great poverty that the most active individual benevolevence could neither provide them with a sufficient present succour nor procure for them within a reasonable time the means of permanent settlement. The consequence was that many of those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to this county or forced by want to become noxious and dangerous to its cities whose original dispositions and qualifications if rightly directed and employed would have made them valuable and useful members of the community. Besides the accounts transmitted back to Ireland of their disappointments and destitute situations deferred many who were suffering at home the extreme of wretchedness from endeavouring to better their condition in this more fortunate and favoured land–to the political institutions of which they were also more strongly attached.A very painful reflection on these circumstances had suggested to come gentlemen then present the hope that the general Government might be induced by a strong and united application to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms liberal and bountiful so that an asylum might be formed for industrious and enterprising farmers who would gladly fly from famine and persecution to a spot where the sweat of their brows falling on a fertile soil would yield them a rich harvest for their own exclusive benefit and where they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of that republication liberty they loved. The time for making such an application seemed auspicious ; party asperities had softened fown and probably few would now be led by political prejudices to give it opposition. Neither was it unprecedented ; a favour nearly similar had been granted to the French emigrants and to settlers from Switzerland.It is true we could not forth a pretence like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and we would not succeed by practising any delusion. We could offer nothing but an immediate accession of industrious and hardy settlers who in a congenial soil and climate would become enthusiastically attached to the country and the Government from whence they derived all their blessings and wherever they were found would form a barrier against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly be expected from the generous sympathy which the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had everywhere excited in the United States and from the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not only those that in the ordinary course of events would arrive here whose usefulness is lost by the want of proper direction and who become burdens or scourges to our cities would be rescued and placed in a situation where all the energies of active and enterprising minds would be serviceable to themselves and the community ; but also the very fact that such an asylum was open and accessible would infinitely increase the amount of emigration from Ireland and people our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is in the Illinois territory–it has been lately purchased and is not yet even surveyed. In the ordinary course of events it is not likely to be brought into market (at least to any extent) for many years ; but if Congress listen to our application and grant to the settlers an extended credit Government will receive payment for the land probably as soon as if it were suffered to remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale came round. A large body of settlers will be enabled to grow rich during the time that the land would otherwise be waste and unproductive and the value of all the contiguous property belonging to the United States would be rapidly and immensely increased to say nothing of the advantages resulting from the strength of such a settled frontier. All these considerations may be strongly urged by men who can most truly say they are actuated by no views of personal speculation or emolument ; who are willing to enter into all the labour of procuring settlers and organising the establishment without any prospect of gain or even compensation except as to what may be necessary for defraying the expences of the undertaking ; and who are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy all the advantages which Government may be willing to grant.These are our views–we conceive that they may be realized if supported by an united and active co-operation of those who think like us in other parts of the Union. We are therefore desirous of adopting and pointing out to others what seems to be the best mode of giving system to that co-operation ; namely the formation of societies totally divested of all party or political feelings and directing the attention only to this object. There are already a sufficient number of political institutions in every State in which the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they may) can act on them to their fullest extent. Let these societies be neutral groun or rather consecrated places in which when we meet we lay aside all our hostilities and join as brothers in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our common worship. They are consecrated to every man amongst us by the purity of their object by our earliest recollections by our unbroken affection and our strongest sympathies– by the unextinguished love of our native land for which most of us have already renounced all sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; which we offer as a solemn pledge to the country of our adoption that our hearts will be always alive from temperament as well as prin ciple to the emotions of patriotism ; and that those amongst us who have pledged their faith to her however they may seem to differ on some minor political subjects will always be found firmly ranged and united under the same banners and forming one phalanx whenever her more important interests are concerned.Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions which being severally put were carried with some slight amendments as follow :–1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen for the purpose of endeavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the Illinois territory to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing description who shall on or before the second day of December next pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five dollars shall be entitled to become a Member of the said Society until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to one hundred after which time the subscribers shall be at liberty to elect their own officers and no person shall afterwards be admitted except by ballot. 3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen and the descendents of Irishmen in the other cities and towns of the Union to form similar societies for the purpose of corresponding and co-operating with that which is about to be formed in this city. 4. Resolved–That as the meeting of Congress will shortly take place and in order to prevent the less of time a Committee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a memorial to that body to be submitted to the consideration of the Society when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such measures as they may think expedient for promoting and accelebrating the organization of that Society.Mr John W. Mulligan in seconding Mr Emmet's motion expressed in handsome terms how much he was gratified by the invitation to attend had given him the opportunity of claiming his title of descendent of an Irishman.A Committee was then appointed pursuant to the fourth resolution the number being upon motion and discussion augmented to twentyone.Committee–Andrew Morris Thomas Addis Emmet William Sampson John W.

Those persons who wish to become original members may do so by signing their names and paying their subscription to the Secretary before 2d December pursuant to the second resolution.After the meeting was adjourned the Committee organized itself and appointed Sub-Committees to report a draft of a constitution and a memorial to Congress and for the discharge of other requisite duties.,emigration ID126,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,28,inform,CanadaExtract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia to their Correspondents in this quarter.We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland from the British North American Provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?] at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?] and that on very moderate terms ; but in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces.The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive ; to prove this many obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists all the Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber and the import of so ponderous an article as [?] employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813 when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand that 28s. was given for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration and introduces many valuable settlers into this Province and the Canadas that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived the merchants in that line[?] as well as the ship-masters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?] what shall we do for Timber and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore in time of war Britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace.Extract of a Letter dated Savannah 25th Nov. 1817In the Southern States this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization.

To H. Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better,emigration ID330,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,07,entertain,New-York Oct. 11.

It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted.Oct. 13. The ship Betsy Rook arrived on the 6th instant at Wilmington Delaware from Londonderry in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants some of them people of property; who weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint St. Patrick have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany.The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence and has left a widow and five scorpions. I understand he died deetested and made me executioner but as the estate is like to prove insolent I was told that as you was Judge of reprobates you must send me a letter of condemnation. And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray &c.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in the county of Lincoln Massachusets dated Sept. 14.We have had a very wet season here since you went from us and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens and all the grass; of course as the natural consequences we have no milk neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insectsExtract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20A firm peace being now to all appearance secured between the United States and the Creek Indians we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and ??? in the river of St. Mary's.Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight with which they were no less delighted than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???.Boston Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port the ship Columbia Capt. Robert Gray on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen owners of the ship for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of ??? has returned to the place of its nativity.Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a ??? without being beyond doubt certain of ??? was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example.I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained.,emigration ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States.

They have also endowed public schools employed ??? and erected places of Public Worship.The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver.The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles.The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin.The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar.The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime.Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns.The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day.The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth.The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey.

The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North.,emigration
