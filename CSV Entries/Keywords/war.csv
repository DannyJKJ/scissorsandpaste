She is heavy laden having on board six hundread hogsheads of tobacco a large quantity of pipe staves barrel hoops &c. and has been expected more than two months. Eight per cent was offered as insurance on ship and cargo but refused on account of the then probability of a war. ID316,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,07,inform,MONDAY JAN. 7. By the Fanny Capt. Bryen arrived in twenty four days from New York we have American papers of which we give the following important intelligence:–It is an undoubted truth (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet Governor of Louisiana and Governor O'Neal of Pensaco la have opened the shores of the King of Spain in West-Florida to the Creeks and Cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States and that quickly that now or never was the time while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes.On the 30th of September about midnight John Buchanan's station four miles south of Nashville) at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station.During the whole time of the attack the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable.Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee and the lower Cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement.On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command of Cape Crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of Indians commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail a brother of the Bench and Talohteske consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.James Paul was killed in the knife and George Morse and Robert Sharp at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded 3 horses were killed and 7 taken off.These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part!!!We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina) that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores and 28 buildings of other descriptions. ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuriesCarlisle Jan. 4. 1792.By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday we are informed that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin were taken by Indians and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany.Extract of a Letter from Patowmack North Amer ca Feb. 7.Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish which he left about two weeks ago and who gave us the following pleasing interesting and important intelligence viz that two days before he left Cat-fish two men arrived there from Licking who informed that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky under General Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance who when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken riding the bullocks dancing &c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott who with the main body were a few miles in the rear he divided them into three divisions advanced and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short but victorious on the side of the volunteers 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott having lost but six men returned to Licking in triumph with most of the cattle stores &c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men but finding his number was insufficient was returning but met a body of 900 volunteers when upon joining him he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful.Our informant further adds that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January at Morgan Town brought by Major Scott's expedition which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps. ID321,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,05,inform,The Indian Chiefs lately arrived in town are six in number. They have been indiscriminately styled Cherokees but three of them only are of that nation and three are Creek Indians.–They are all handsome men not exceeding in age twenty- five or twenty-six. These six Chiefs have 20000 warriors ready to take the field and have the strongest wish to act in conjunction with the English. They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry.The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at. They long to make an attack upon the Spanish settlements. One of them was heard last night in the playhouse to say he hoped in six months from this time to be in the heart of Mexico. ID322,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,08,inform,When hostilities are once commenced a for fidable armament will unquestionable be sent against the Spanish South American colonies. Of its success there cannot be a doubt when we shall be aided by an army of 20000 Indian warriors beside the active support of those Mexicans now ??? under the tyranous yoke of Spain.So determined are the Cherokees the Creeks and other nations of Indians in the Southern parts of America to strip the Spaniards of their possessions on that Continent that they will unquestionably attempt the glorious achievement even though the policy of this country should prevent us from lending them effectual assistance.The rich silver mines at Potosi in Peru were accidentally discovered in 1545 by an Indian as he was clambering up the mountain in pursuit of a Lama which had strayed from his flock. Soon after the mines of Sacotecas in New Spain little inferior to the other in value were opened. From that time successive discoveries have been made in both colonies and silver mines are now so numerous that the working of them and of some few mines of gold in the provinces of Terra Firm and the new Kingdom of Grenada has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards and is reduced into the system no less complicated than interesting. ID323,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,11,08,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Muskingum to his Friend in the City of Norwich (Connecticut) dated Nov. 24 1790.The prospect of peace from our frontiers seems to me to be vanished for the present; the troops from this garrison have this morning returned and the best account I can collect of the expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amounting to about 1200 militia and about 300 regulars after seventeen days march from Miami reached the great Miami village about 170 miles without any molestation except having a number of their pack-horse stole.–On their arrival they found the village deserted and all the valuable builder a short tarry they proceeded to neighings set on flames by the Indians. Afbouring villages without molestation and deftroyed five of them and a quantity of corn computed at fifteen thousand bushels which they found buried in different places and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with a party of about 150 Kentucky militia and thirty regular troops all under the command of Col. Hardin of Kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great Miami village to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of Indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn of Franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking. After this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town the General ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by Major Wylls all under the command of Col. Harden with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of Indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect. The regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls of Hartford and Lieut. Frothingham of Middletown. Of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages.No damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe; if not we are much exposed. ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26.We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured. Such devastation may shortly be expected to take placethat the name of a Shawenese nation will be no more.that on this side the Cumberland mountains please prospects are in view; a general peace is likely to take place with the Southern Tribes; a regular and efficient system of government is about being established under the auspices of Congress: one of the mildest seasons in a temperate and salubrious climate with the most exuberantharvest gives joy to the husband and animates the diligence and industry of all.Extract of a letter from a Gentleman on the Ohio. Since my last the Gentlemen I mentioned to you are forming themselves into a Company for the purpose of building three vessels of force amounting from twenty to forty 24 pounders completely manned and quipped. They purpose loading with tobacco flour &c. and proceed tos ea by the gulph of Mexico with a full determination to punish severely every insult which in violation of treaties may be offered to the American flag sailing down the Mississippi.It is generally supposed they will embark between twelve and fifteen hundred men in orto ??? America's ??? to the navigation of the Mississippi. ID327,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,07,inform,CONGRESS. Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and ??? in the river of St. Mary's.Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example.I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained. ID333,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,06,24,inform,The Indians on the borders of Kentucky continue to commit the most horrible acts of cruelty upon such unfortunate Americans as fall in their power. The burning of the Miami villages and the destruction of their corn and vegetables instead of intimidating those ferocious savage have made them more and more vindictive and restless; and being acquainted with all the passes in the country they bid defiance to their pursuers whom they frequently surprise and cut off. ID334,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,10,inform,From theNew York Journal.

From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the ??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury.Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13.One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now Heaven knows while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country and no one will arrest them. ID335,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,09,inform,Halifax April 6.The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair.Since the retreat of the f–eral troops under General Harmar the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties. A large body of them on the 2d of February attacked the settlements called Big Bottom twenty miles from Harman on the Muilsingam which they entirely destroyed. Eleven men and two children were massacred two escaped and three were taken prisoners.Boston.The amount of the value of theexports from the United States for thirteen months agreeable to an estimate made at the Office of the Treasury in 20000000 dollars.The greatest apprehensions are entertained of an invasion from our savage neighbours; as accounts from Philadelphia state that there has been a confederation of all the South West Indians to fall on our frontiers early in the spring.Similiar apprehensions have driven the inhabitants in the country of Marcetta from their plantations into the city where they do military duty.According to the late Census the number of inhabitants in this commonwealth is 470000.Philadelphia April 7. Congress met here to-day and made a house Articles of the Constitution that were not liked by many of us are altered much for the better– among other things we were dissatisfied that not any notice was taken of Religion as we wanted it expressly declared that not any sect should ever be established in preference to another.–This is now done. In this part of the world we know not any thing of Toleration–all are equally free.It is said we have land for upwards of an hundred millions of people; we are yet about three so thatfor sometime we have have not any great cause to fight for territory. ID336,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,13,inform,The Indian war in America is now become an object of considerable importance by the junction of several tribes of Indians hitherto ??? with those already engaged in it. General Washington is expected to take the command of the army intended to serve against them in the present summer. ID337,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,20,inform,Letters dated Halifax Feb 7 brought by the Schooner Joseph arrived at Glasgow say the Indians have beat the Americans in a second action in which 48 officers and 800 men were killed of the American army besides the loss of all their field pieces arms and stores. since this battle the Indians are increasing and become very powerful. ID338,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,inform,Abstract of American Finances as laid before Congress January 23 by Alexander Hamilton Esq; Secretary to the Treasury of the United States.Revenue.Dollars.Duties on Imports for the year 1792 estimated at 3300000 Duties on home made spirits for 1792 estimated at 400000 ___________Total 3700000Expences.Dollars.

That M'Gilvray and his army of savages after an unsuccessful and bloody engagement had fled to the woods where the General left them and returned to Savannah.– This expedition was undertaken about the beginning of March winch has been crowned with the expected catastrophe and though the Cherokee Miami and Chiquesaw tribes may mediate revenge at some future period; it is not likely they will be in a condition to disturb the settlers for some years to come. ID342,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,12,inform,Letters from Alexandria in Virginia dated the 9th May last mention that General Wayne had been dispatched in the beginning of March on an expedition against the Cherokee Miamis and Chickesau Indians who have for some time past had as their chief warrior one Macgillivray a Scotchman who has long resided among these Indians. General Wayne at the head of two thousand Provincials had completely routed them after a great slaughter. After the battle Macgillivray and his savages took refuge in the woods. General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river which is the boundary of Georgia after which he returned to Savannah. This defeat is so total that it will put it out of the power of these Indians to be again troublesome to the State of Virginia. ID343,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,06,18,persuade,The American States having now gained their independence have no cause of quarrel let with this country; but matters are very different between them and Spain. It is well known that the Indians on the back settlements have been regularly supplied with arms and ammunition from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies to enable them to distress the Americans and prove at least a hindrance to their growing prosperity.The free navigation of the Mississippi has been denied them?and the Spaniards now in possession of the Floridas have been continually quarrelling with them about their boundaries.It may therefore be considered as almost certain that the American states will take an active part against Spain. This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands. Their privateers too will be able to take their runs so speedily that the Spanish trade must be very materially injured thereby. ID349,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,07,25,entertain,Norfolk April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion John Simmons master in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind the Albion shipped a sea which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught and belonged to Greenock.Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio to his relation in Winchester Virginia. dated April 13 1791.I wrote to you from Fort Pitt which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats and proceeded to Limestone without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a French station loaded with bacon butter &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston lost 25000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience.Salem May 31.

They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus with the motto Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man.But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre.To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence.In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness.George-Town. April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known. ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties.We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost. ID352,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,20,inform,Extract of a letter from New York ???A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians commanded by one of their greatest Warriors who was left dead on the field amongst many hundreds of his followers.The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June by a company of Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New York aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants; and after a contest of three hours put them totally to the rout. The carnage was general amongst the Indians and no quarter given as it might operate as a terror in future to those savage Freebooters whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and oftentimes ??? with personal cruelty to those in their power has exasperated the Communities to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an opportunity offered. ID353,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,12,14,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia dated Nov. 1.Advice received from Governor Blount dated the latter end of September informs us that the Cherokees of the five lower towns on the Tenesee headed by John Watts and Esquaka or the bloody fellow has declared war against the United States and that the warriors according to various authentic accounts amount to near 600 including about one hundred banditti Creeks; another letter mentions that the above force had actually set out on some expedition against the frontiers; it is feared they will fall first on Cumberland settlement. ID354,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,10,08,entertain,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses.Newtown June 27.On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made.
