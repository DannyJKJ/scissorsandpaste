It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require.Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyFrom the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations.The speech concludes with a call for supplies.ProclamationThe unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government.Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain.[The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.]Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.,war ID107,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,11,09,inform,War in CanadaExtract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25 Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New York a few days ago. On his way he passed three days at Plattsburgh the head-quarters of the American army which from ocular observation he states to consist of 8 or 10000 men under the command of General Bloomfield Mooar and Petit. This force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars about the same number of militia and some volunteers from the southward. The militia is almost all from the state of New York for the Yankees still refuse to march. with this force no doubt is entertained here but theywill make an attack ; and if they mean to make it this season they must be prompt in their movements for the weather is getting cold and they are not well clothed or appointed. Mr – indeed states half of them to be without shoes or stockings which will never do for a winter campaign in this country. To repel the threatened attack we are making every preparation in our power and the Canadians seem well disposed to second the Government. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon the left of which is at Chambly and extending to Chateaguny ; the main encampment is half way between St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-au Noix is strongly fortified with a boom and a chain secured across the river. This line of defence is composed of four regiments of the line and 2000 drafted militia with a corps of about 400 Canadian voltigeurs raised last spring. The Royals a very strong battalion lately arrived from the West Indies are now marching to join the camp. The citizens both here and at Quebec mount guard and do garrison : indeed there are in this island (Montreal) five battalions of militia say 3 to 4000 men pretty well disciplined and who on an alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– A new regiment of embodied militia has lately been formed by drafts from the different regiments of inrolled militia in this island and old Major Murray is appointed Lieutenant-Colonel. The gentlemen of the North-west Company army are forming a corps of their voyageurs who will be most useful troops to act in advance with the Indians. The number originally proposed was 200 but the men have come forward so handsomely that they are to consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of this corps Mr Shaw Major and the other partners of the Company are Captains and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded by those whom they have accustomed to obey may be considered as already disciplined at least in point of subordination.Sir George confines his operations to mere defence. La Motte with about 70 Indians advanced through the woods about ten days ago within hearing of this redoubtable army and set up a war whoop which so completely terrified them that though they could see no enemy they lay on their arms for two two successive nights in no expectation of an attack–to prevent which they cut down their best bridge and destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean to invade us. Mr – who was several days at their headquarters and who was offered the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army has it is said proposed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 men ; and Sir George is said to have replied that his plan was fixed not to make any attack nor to send a man across the line.This forebearance which the Yankees impute to fear or weakness tends only to increase their insolent swaggering and their enmity is to inveterate to be allayed by any thing but hard knocks.,war ID108,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,16,inform,CanadaThe Rota frigate arrived on Monday off Plymouth with a fleet from Halifax under convoy and passed up the channel with the chief part of the trade. From the Hydra transport which put into Plymouth we have received the following official notification of Sir James Yeo's success on Lake Ontario the American notices of which have already been published.Bulletin.Head-quarters Kingston Aug. 14. 1813 By accounts received from his Excellency the Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces from Commodore Sir James Yeo dated off York half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant the following particulars have been transmitted of the capture and loss of the enemy's armed schooners:–On Thursday evening last the 10th instant the enemy's squadron under the Command of Commodore Chauncey got under weigh from their anchorage off the mouth of Niagara River and with a fine breeze from the east stood towards our fleet which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile Creek. At sun-set a breeze coming off the land gave us the wind of the enemy when our squadron stood for them on which immediately bore away from us under as much sail as their schooners could carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's fleet formed a long. The Pike Madison Oneida and six schooners (two schooners were placed to windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our squadron as it should come up). At eleven the squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners when they opened a brisk fire and from their going so fast it was more than an hour before the Wolf our headmost ship could pass them ; at this time the rest of the squadron was two and three miles astern of the Wolf and on her coming up with the Madison and Pike they put before the wind and made sail firing their stern-chasers.– Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squadron up with the enemy as the Wolf was the only ship which could keep up with them then made sail between them and the two schooners to wind ward which he captured and which are called the Julia and Growler each carrying one long 32 pounder and long 12-pounder and 40 men.– Two of the enemy's largest schooners the Scourge of 10 and Hamilton of nine guns upset on the night of the 9th in carrying sail and all on board perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and capture the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 vessels and our's increased to eight. It is ascertained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders and 420 men the Madison 22 long 32 pounders and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on board the enemy's squadron on Monday last for the purpose it is supposed of repelling the boarders.– The Wolf has not received any material injury and not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on the 11th instant and the Growler's damage repaired. She had lost her bowsprit and was otherwise cut up.Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthusiasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a close engagement.,war ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,Canada. (From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13.By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser.In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it.A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed.Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813.G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt.Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed.

The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars.

Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans.General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd.The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief.Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as marinersThere were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole.

Morrison consisting of the 49th[?] and 89th regiments with some companies of the Canadian militia and a body of American troops amounting to 4000 men which ended in the defeat of the latter with great loss. This action was produced by the attempt of the American General to advance to Montreal from which it appears however he has now begun to measure back his steps having crossed to the American side of the river where the action was fought and being actively pur sued in his retreat by the British troops.The following information has been received by the Alexander Captain Henry which arrived at Liverpool on Tuesday:–Quebec Nov. 26. 1813 The enemy's whole force was about 8000 men under the command of General Wilkinson. The division commanded by General Boyd consisting of about 3000 to 4000 infantry cavalry &c. was alone engaged upon the 11th instant.The enemy lost in the action Brigadier Gen. Conington and Colonel Preston killed–probably 600 men killed wounded and taken.The consequence was a precipitate retreat across the St Lawrence at Cornwall on the 13th and evacuating the province.

By the Fanny Capt. Bryen arrived in twenty four days from New York we have American papers of which we give the following important intelligence:–It is an undoubted truth (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet Governor of Louisiana and Governor O'Neal of Pensaco la have opened the shores of the King of Spain in West-Florida to the Creeks and Cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States and that quickly that now or never was the time while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes.On the 30th of September about midnight John Buchanan's station four miles south of Nashville) at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station.During the whole time of the attack the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable.Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee and the lower Cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement.On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command of Cape Crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of Indians commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail a brother of the Bench and Talohteske consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.James Paul was killed in the knife and George Morse and Robert Sharp at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded 3 horses were killed and 7 taken off.These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part!!!We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina) that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores and 28 buildings of other descriptions.,war ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come.

They travelled 3000 miles before the reached Halifax and were near 12 months in performing the journey. From Halifax they went in an English frigate to Quebec to Lord Dorchester by whom they were sent over to England to concert their plans in person with the Ministry.The object of their coming to this country may be easily guessed at.

Hardin of Kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great Miami village to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of Indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn of Franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking. After this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town the General ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by Major Wylls all under the command of Col. Harden with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of Indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect. The regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls of Hartford and Lieut. Frothingham of Middletown. Of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages.No damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe; if not we are much exposed.,war ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26.We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured.

Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston.

There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's.

April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut.

On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes.
