To my utter astonishment my rustic landlord did not take in own newspaper; so there was I stuck down with my friend in the country–knowing no more of what passed in town than if I had been in Lapland. Intending every day should be my last I went on without ordering your or any other paper till two months had passed away at which period I returned to town. And there Sir I was quite a new man and just as if I had dropped down from the clouds. Every day I heard people talking of occurrences of which I knew nothing : Revolutions in France by Fishwomen ; and battles in Flanders against the Emperor who I thought was fighting against the Turks.But even this was not the most distressing–for one day meeting a friend I inquired very cordially after his wife who I found a few days afterwards had eloped just before with another gentleman ; and meeting with a lady I inquired kindly for her sister who I found had departed to the other world a fortnight before.On this account I never will stir again out of the world unless your paper goes along with me. I hold a newspaper to be a kind of viaticum with which every man should be provided and which become the more necessary the further we remove from town It. is the only way to keep pace with what is going on every day in the fashionable or literary world–and to prevent talking about dead friends or wives that have absconded.In short Sir a newspaper is my creed–and never will I again travel without my faith along with me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness of being sent back into the world as ignorant as if I had been born again–I hereby give notice– That if an hottentot friend of mine invites me who does not take in your paper or some other– I will not visit him.DICK DESPERATE.,humour ID75,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,19,entertain,CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT From the PITTSBURGH GAZETTEPittsburgh Dec. 23 1789.

DENNIS O'BRYAN.,humour ID89,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,miscellny,Longevity.–At Taconey a small village about seven miles from Philadelphia there is now living a shoemaker of the name of Robert Glen who in December last attained the great age of one hun- dred and fourteen years. Scotland was the place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and was present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his memory nor his sight are in the least impaired; and such is his strength that after working all the week at his profession he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia and back. His third wife is now living nd is not more than thirty years old.,humour
