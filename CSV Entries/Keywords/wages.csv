Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place.I think I never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farm-house are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye [sic] idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many [pence?]. ID141,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Extract of a letter from William Hunt esq. To H. Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful ???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England.The abolition ofNegro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795.The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies.Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed ??? and erected places of Public Worship.The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver.The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles.The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin.The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar.The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime.Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns.The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day.The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth.The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace.The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North. ID346,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,10,04,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia July 22.Trade is brisk at present from the high prices and great sales of grain to Europe. Our farmers and giving above 6 s. currency (about 3s. sterling) to workmen per day and their meat to enable them to take in new grounds which is a great discouragement to our rising manufactories which are obliged to give high wages to their journeymen on that account.A Mr. Doylden from Europe has lately purchased two millions of acres of lands from Congress Mr. Scriba merchant in New York has purchased four millions of acres all from Congress a society of gentlemen with whom it is said some Dutch houses in Amsterdam are concerned have purchased from the State of Georgia about fifteen millions of land on the frontiers of that State. The very highest price paid for any of these purchases has been twenty cents per acre (about ten-pence British money) payable by installments at different periods and that in Congress money.
