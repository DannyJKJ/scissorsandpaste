Walker from Liverpool. They are dated the 16th November and contain an account of the arrival of several ships from Newfoundland and some from Halifax; that provisions of all kinds were very plentiful and reasonable.,agriculture ID4,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,13,inform,Our latest accounts from the West Indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch.The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade.,agriculture ID5,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from Quebec June 6.We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the Governor and Council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job.Government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States though we hear of a cargo from New York for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States.My servant is just come home from the baker's where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the Queen.Mr. Davidson one of the Council assured us on Thursday last there was not wheat and flourin the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration.,agriculture ID7,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk Virginia dated April 2.By Captain Gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi- sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George from Baltimore brought in [?] days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the 30th day of March laden with bread corn; or flour. He also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk with provisions advise them to call at Bermuda.,agriculture ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.THAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory.About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States.The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami.This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops.In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only!* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.,agriculture ID22,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Philadelphia Aug. 5.We are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government.,agriculture ID33,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock.No doubt Sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present.,agriculture ID34,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,The American Congress having declared it to be the interest of the United States to encourage agriculture by the cultivation of large plantations and to purchase their merchandize from Europe have in consequence considerably lowered the duties on such merchandize.They have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land instead of two millions which they sold annually in the States; the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the necessity of circulating paper money any longer.,agriculture ID36,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Orders are sent to Plymouth for the Echo sloop of war Capt. Drew lately arrived from Newfoundland and now lying in the Sound to get ready for sea and proceed with all possible dispatch to New York–to acquaint the American Merchants that the British ports are open for the importation of American wheat :–It is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour.,agriculture ID44,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Advices from Baltimore in Maryland say that all the wheat and flour that could be purchased was actually contracted for throughout that fertile province on the 10th of October last for the French market and it was thought the same man–uvre had taken place at New York Philadelphia and Rhode Island.,agriculture ID51,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,By letters from America dated the 5th ult. we learn that wheat is so great a crop all over the Provinces that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago.Two ships laden with American wheat have already arrived at Bristol where the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders are sent to America for wheat of which there has been a prodigious crop.,agriculture ID52,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,The Americans have refused every kind of supply of grain to the French without the ready money. M. de Mirabeau's scheme of receiving the debt of the United States due to France proves an abortion.,agriculture ID55,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,In consequence of the order of the Privy council the merchants of Bristol have sent large orders to America for wheat where the crop has been the greatest ever known.,agriculture ID71,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,10,04,inform,Extract of a letter from New York Aug. 3.Our harvest is over westward and through the southern counties of this State. This week will finish it in the northern and I am confident we have not had so fine a crop since 1774 and all gathered without a drop of rain which will render wheat fit for exportation in OCtober. The Summer grains are also abundant and those on the ground especially Indian corn equally promising. Should Europe require wheat at even two thirds of the prices given last year we shall draw a very large balance from them in specie.The public debt of this country having in course of a few days been funded brought many foreigners into deep speculations which reduced bills of exchange to par.,agriculture ID78,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,By letters from the New York Packet dated October 6 from Philadelphia we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods imported the last season was immense goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.,agriculture ID102,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1802,07,01,inform,New South WalesThe following particulars respecting this flourishing colony will not be unacceptable to our readers :–We are informed by Lieutenant Grant who is lately arrived from New South Wales of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left Port Jackson in November last when the crops were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut down without having suffered that year from the floods.Governor King had opened a communication with Otaheite for the purpose of supplying the colony with pork in which he had been singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship Porpoise having made one trip and the Norfolk brig having sailed on the same employ previous to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney.The most friendly understanding exists between the natives of Otaheite and the settlement of New South Wales. We are happy to hear that the latter country is longer in want of a staple commodity the article of coals of an excellent kind being found in abundance in Hunter's River together with plenty of wood well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good Hope round Cape Horn in the brig Anna Josepha loaded with spars for masts and coals which latter sold immediately at the Cape at 36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.)Governor King had formed a small settlement at Hunter's River for the purpose of working the coal which is of the same nature with that of Newcastle.Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady Nelson in order to obtain the survey of it. He penetrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up the same accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel Paterson without being able at that time to discover its source. A wood resembling sustic had also been found.Mr Grant in his passage from England to Port Jackson in the Lady Nelson a vessel of only 60 tons burthen with three sliding keels and built on Captain Schank's construction was the first that passed through the straits which separate Van Diemens Land from New Holland and sailed along a great extent of coast to the westward of any land before seen by those who had visited that country going into no higher latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes that the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. fourth. He found those he sailed along bold with very deep water wherever he attempted to land ; and in general he had with a very moderate offing from 50 10 45 and 30 fathoms water fine land and sometimes shells.By order of Governor King he returned into those straits and obtained the survey of the coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western Port with the survey of that harbour which is well sheltered and capable of containing many sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood easily to be got and plenty of water ; though the latter is rather difficult to be procured on account of the distance and from several shoals lying in the way which render it necessary to take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very favourable report of that part of the country.,agriculture ID117,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1816,01,15,inform,New South WalesA journey into the interior of New South Wales across the Blue Mountains performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac quarrie Governor of the settlement. From the official account dated Sydney June 10. 1815.The Governor desires to communicate for the information of the public the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue Mountains undertaken for the purpose of being enabled personally to appreciate the importance of the track of country lying westward of them which had been explored in the latter end of the year 1813 and beginning of 1814 by Mr George William Evans Deputy Surveyor of Lands.To those who know how very limited a track of country has been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Walves extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of Port Jackson only 80 miles and westward about 40 miles to the foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its western boundary it must be a subject of astonishment and regret that amongst so large a population no one appeared within the first twenty-five years of the establishment of this settlement possessed of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a passage over these mountains ; but when it is considered that for the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country beyond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an impenetrable forest the surprise at the want of effort to surmount such difficulties must abate very considerably.The records of the colony only afford two instances of any bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the westward of the Blue Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass and the other by Mr Caley and both ended in disappointment; a cirumstance which will not be much wondered at by those who have lately crossed these mountains.To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson of the Royal veteran company the merit is due of having with extraordinary patience and much fatigu effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part of the Blue Mountains.The Governor being strongly impressed with the importance of the object had early after his arrival in this colony formed the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the western country and willingly availed himself of the facilities which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly on the 20th of November 1813 he entrusted the accomplishment of this object to Mr George William Evans deputy surveyor of lands the result of whose journey was laid before the public through the medium of the Sydney Gazette on the 12th of February 1814.The favourable account given by Mr Evans of the country he had explored induced the Governor to cause a road to be constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and provisions to the interior ; and men of good character from amongst a number of convicts who had volunteered their services were selected to perform this arduous work on condition of being fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour and being granted emancipations as their final reward on the completion of the work.The direction and superintendence of this great work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be encountered and sees what has been done he effected its completion in six months from the time of its commencement happily without the loss of a man or any serious accident. The Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony in the execution of this arduous work which promises to be of the greatest public utility by opening a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising. When it is considered that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the comforts of his own house and the society of his numerous family and exposed himself to much personal fatigue with only such temporary covering as the bark hut could afford from the inclemency of the season it is difficult to express the sentiments of approbation to which such privations and services are entitled.Mr Cox having reported the road as completed on the 21st of January the Governor accompanied by Mrs Macquarrie and that gentleman commenced his tour on the 25th of April last over the Blue Mountains and was joined by Sir John Jamieson at the Nepean who accompanied him during the entire tour. The following gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: Mr Campbell Secretary ; Captain Antill Major of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts Aide de camp ; Mr Redfern Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr Oxley Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan Deputy Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin Painter and Naturalist ; and Mr G. Evans Deputy Surveyor of lands who had been sent forward for the purpose of making further discoveries and rejoined the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst Plains.The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the first depot and thence to a resting place now called Spring Wood distant twelve miles from Emu Ford was through a very handsome open forests of lofty trees and much more practicable and easy than was expected. The facility of the ascent for this distance excited surprise and is certainly not well calculated to give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards to encounter. At a further disstance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the quality of the soil the former becoming stunted and the latter barren and rocky. At this place the fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. Here the country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th mile (it is to be observed that the measure commences at Emu Ford) a pile of stones attracted attention. It is close to the line of road on the top of a rugged and abrupt ascent and is supposed to have been placed there by Mr Caley as the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Governor gave that part of the mountain the name as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so far was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a succession of steep and rugged hills some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether ; but at this place a considerable extensive plain is arrived at which constitutes the summit of the western mountains ; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town of Windsor the river Hawkesbury Prospect Hill and other objects within that part of the colony now inhabited of equal interest are distinctly seen from hence. The majestic grandeur of the situation combined with the various objects to be seen from this place induced the Governor to give it the appellation of the King's Table Land. On the south-west side of the King's Table Land the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth at the bottom of which is seen a glen as romantically beautiful as can be imagined bounded on the further side by mountains of great magnitude terminating equally abruptly as the others and the whole thickly covered with wood. The length of this picturesque and remarkable track of country is about 24 miles to which the Governor gave the name of the Prince Regent's Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile on the top of a hill an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the Prince Regent's Glen from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and grand–mountains rising beyond mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the fore ground here strike the eye with admiration and astonishment. The circular form in which the whole is so wonderfully disposed induced the Governor to give the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side of the Prince Regent's Glen and there it suddenly terminates in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high as ascertained by measurement. The road constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and tremendous descent through all its windings is no less than three-fourths of a mile in length and has been executed with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him. The labour here undergone and the difficulties surmounted can only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to perpetuate the memory of Mr Cox's services the Governor deemed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name to this grand and extraordinary pass and he accordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descended into a valley at the bottom of this pass the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain is magnificently grand. Although the present pass is the only practicable point yet discovered for descending by yet the mountain is much higher than those on either side of it from whence it is distinguished at a considerable distance when approaching it from the interior and in this point of view it has the appearance of a very high distinct hill although it is in fact only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The Governor gave the name of Mount York to this termination of the ridge in honour of his Royal Highness the Duke of York.On descending Cox' Pass the Governor was much gratified by the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultivation which was the first he had met with since the commencement of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount York he called the Vale of Clwyd in consequence of the strong resemblance it bore to the vale of that name in North Wales. The grass in this vale is of a good quality and very [?]dant and a rivulet of fine water runs along it from the eastward which unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another rivulet containing still more water. The junction of these two streams forms a very handsome river now called by the Governor Cox's River which takes its course as has been since ascertained through the Prince Regent's Glen and empties itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjectured from the nature of the country through which it passes that it mut be one of the principal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkesbury into which the Nepean discharges itself. The Vale of Clwyd from the base of Mount York extends six miles in a westerly direction and has its termination at Cox's River. Westward of this river the country again becomes hilly but it is generally open forest land and very good passage.Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd Messrs Blaxland Wentworth and Lawson had formerly terminated their excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which they had to contend with especially until they had effected the descent from Mount York to which place they were obliged to pass through a thick brush-wood where they were under the necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage horses the severity of which labour had seriously affected their healths their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much surprise and admiration. In commemoration of their merits three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their tour at this place have receieved their names in the following order viz. Mount Blaxland Wentworth's Sugar Loaf and Lawson's Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and narrow vallies alternately form the track of country from Cox's River for a distance of 16 miles until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this range the Governor gave the name of Clarence Hilly Range.Proceeding from the Fish River and at a short distance from it a very singular and beautiful mountain attracts the attentions its summit being crowned with a large and very extraordinary looking rock nearly circular in form which gives the whole very much the appearance of a hill fort such as are frequent in India. To this lofty hill Mr Evans who was the first European discoverer gave the name of Mount Evans. Passing on from hence the country continues hilly but affords good pasturage gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley which is distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight miles. The land here is level and the first met with unencumbered with timber. It is not of very considerable extent but abounds with a great variety of herbs and plants such as would probably highly interest and gratify the scientific botanist. The beautiful little valley runs northwest and south-east between hills of easy ascent thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth Valley the country becomes again hilly and in other respects resembles very much the country to the eastward of the valley for some miles. Having reached Campbell River distant 13 miles from Sidmouth Valley the Governor was highly gratified by the appearance of the country which there began to exhibity an open and extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains. Judging from the height of the banks and its general width the Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently prevailed on the western side of the mountains equally as throughout this colony for the last three years has reduced this river so much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than a running stream at the present time. In the reaches or pools of the Campbell River the very curious animal called the Paradox or Water Mole is seen in great numbers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly rich and the grass is consequently luxuriant. Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses the Campbell River there is a very fine rich track of low lands which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here growing in considerable quanities. The Fish River which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the northward of the road and bridge over the latter has also two very fertile plains on its banks the one called O'Connel Plains and the other Macquarrie Plains both of considerable extent and very capable of yielding all the necessities of life.At the distance of seven miles from the bridge over the Campbell River Bathurst Plains open to the view presenting a rich track of champaign country of 11 miles in length bounded on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River which is constituted by the junction of the Fish and Campbell River takes a winding course through the Plains which can be easily traced from the high lands ajoining by the particular verdure of the trees on its banks which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent of the plains. The level and clean surface of these plains gives them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state of cultivation.It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling of admiration and surprise whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man created a degree of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined than described.The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains on Thursday the 4th of May and encamped on the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie River–the situation being selected in consequence of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for many miles in every direction around it. At this place the Governor remained for a week which time he occupied in making excursions in different directions through the adjoining country on both sides the river.On Sunday the 7th of May the Governor fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town at some future period to which he gave the name of Bathurst in honour of the present Secretary of State for the Colonies. The situation of Bathurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may occur and is at the same time so near to the river on its south bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to themselves at this place will have the highly important advantages of a rich and fertile soil with a beautiful river flowing through it for all the uses of man. The Governor mut however add that the hopes which were once so sanguinely entertained of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea have ended in disappointment.During the week that the Governor remained at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a south-west direction and on that occasion as well as on all the others he found the country chiefly composed of vallies and plains separated occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil throughout being generally fertile and well circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing.The Governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to communicate to the public that the favourable reports which he had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains have not been by any means exaggerated. The difficulties which present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great and inevitable but thsoe persons who may be inclined to become permanent settlers there will probably content themselves withvisiting this part of the colony but rarely and of course will have them seldom to encounter. Plenty of water and a sufficiency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support of such cattle as may be sent over them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords are fully extensive enough for any increase of population and stock which can possibly take place for many years.Within a distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst there is not less than 50000 acres of land clear of timber and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil well calculated for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in proportion as the soil improves the timber degenerates ; and it is to be remarked that everywhere to the westward of the mountains it is much inferior both in size and quality to that within the present colony ; there is however a sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within the district around Bathurst for the purposes of house-building and husbandry.The Governor has here to lament that neither coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in the western country ; articles in themselves of so much importance that the want of them must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled.Having enumerated the principal and most important features of this new country the Governor has now to notice some of its live productions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great quantity of fish but all of one denomination resembling the perch in appearance and of a delicate and fine flavour not unlike that of a rock cod. This fish grows to a large size and is very voracious. Several of them were caught during the Governor's stay at Bathurst and at the halting place on the Fish River. One of those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught some weighing 25 lb.The field game are the kangaroos emus black swans wild geese wild turkies bustards ducks of various kinds quail bronze and other pigeons &c. &c. The water mole or paradox also abounds in all the rivers and ponds.The site designed for the towns of Bathurst by observation taken at the Flag Staff which was erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that name is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House In Sydney and 94 1/2 west of it bearing west 20. 30. north 83 geographic miles or 95 1/2 statute miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney to Bathurst being 140 English miles.The road constructed by Mr Cox and the party under him commences at Emu Ford on the left bank of the river Nepean and is thence carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. This road has been carefully measured and each mile regularly marked on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding towards Bathurst.The Governor in his tour made the following stages in which he was principally regulated by the consideration of having good pasturage for the cattle and plenty of water :–1st stage–Spring Wood distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley or 2d depot distant from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 3d ditto–Blackheath distant from ditto . . . 41 4th ditto–Cox's River distant from ditto . . .56 5th ditto–The Fish River distant from ditto . 72 6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley distant from ditto . 80 7th ditto–Campbell River distant from ditto . 91 8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2At all of which places the traveller may assure himself of good grass and water in abundance.On Thursday the 11th of May the Governor and suite set out from Bathurst on their return and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 19th Ult.The Governor deems it expedient here to notify to the public that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the westward of the Blue Mountains until he shall receive the commands of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject and in reply to the report he is now about to make them upon it.In the mean time such gentlemen or other respectable free persons as may wish to visit this new country will be permitted to do so on making a written application to the Governor to that effect who will order them to be furnished with written passes. It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed that no person whether civil or military shall attempt to travel over the Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and obtained permission in the above prescribed form. The military guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shall not have obtained regular passes. The necessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to every one who will reflect on it to require any explanation here.The Governor cannot conclude this account of his tour without offering his best ackowledgements to William Cox Esq. for the important services he has rendered to the colony in so short a period of time by opening a passage to the new discovered country and at the same time assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious services on this occasion to the favourable consideration of his Majesty's Ministers.,agriculture ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America.[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ].Cobbett's arrival in America&c.On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow.Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.,agriculture ID122,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,01,inform,EmigrationThe authenticity of the following details of the miseries endured by some German emigrants proceeding from Amsterdam to America is we are told guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost too shocking to admit to belief :Libson Nov. 4We have just been witnesses here of an event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions which the friends of humanity have indulged ever since the commencement of the emigration from Germany and Switzerland to America. We have deplored the error which led so great a number of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores of the new world. But it is less to the blindness of the victims of this error than to the abominable speculations of cupidity that we are to attribute these numerous emigrations.the misery of the people of Germany and Switzerland occasioned by a superabundance of population and by the bad harvests of late years serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men who seek to establish criminal projects upon bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former slave trade. Such calculations deserve the attention of Governments and it is with this view that we think is our duty to make known the fate of an expedition of this kind fitted out at Amsterdam last August.But we shall first transcribe from the original the article of the charter party relative to the power reserved by the Captain over the persons of the passengers as inlcuding stipulations which are most characteristic of the nature of that odious traffic :–We passengers promise to fulfil faithfully the following conditions:– With respect to the price of the passage above stipulated for so much as we have not yet paid we engage to gain by our labour in America what we owe and we who owe the whole amount of our passage are bound if required and if we are unable to find better conditions to hire ourselves for four or five years in order to pay for our passage ; and we who have only paid for a part of our passage equally promise to let ourselves out to work for the same time for the sum we still owe.We promise besides we passengers men or women fathers or mothers children and families here assembled the children for their parents the parents for their children the brother for his brother and the sister for her sister when we shall find an opportunity to employ ourselves in America to engage ourselves in service and to answer for one for the other one for all the others whether he be of our family or not so that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as much as shall be necessary until we all and our families have employment and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very well that we passengers who have children a family brothers and sisters ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands our children our brothers our sisters being sent separately to whatever place in order to gain in private service profession or labour or in any manner that shall be deemed best the price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case refused the engagements proposed to us or contract others without the permission not knowledge of the capain it is agreed for those who have not yet paid for their passage for those who still owe part and for those who cannot find an engagement that they must consent to me the captain carrying them to such place in America as it shall please me and wherever I may find it expedient to proceed or wherever it may suit me to sail.These horrible conditions were signed by 300 passengers. They had contracted with the Captain of a Dutch ship which was to proceed first to Baltimore. She in the worst state when she sailed from Amsterdam and in defiance of the clauses of the contract by which the Captain had engaged to feed them properly during the voyage he had not even embarked the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for after 62 days navigation the leaks had so gained upon the ship that she was in danger of sinking and famine had already made frightful ravages. It was at the end of that time and in this deplo rable condition that she was forced into Belem near Lisbon.Long before her arrival on our coasts the passengers had been reduced to the greatest misery not more by the small quantity than by the bad quality of the provisions. The water was gone and sea-water was their only drink. So much had they been wasted that forty had already died of famine. Among the rest there were a great many sick some of who have died since their arrival in Portugal.The situation of the vessel had at first given great alarm to our Council of Health who apprehensive of contagion were for an instant fearful that it would be necessary to force her out to sea. That would have been a misery so much the more formidable because the ship was not in a state to keep the sea and all must infallibly have perished. Happily this was deemed unnecessary and a quarantine was ordered. The Regency of Lisbon determined that provisions and other succours should be furnished at the expence of the State. All the Consuls were most active and benevolent in affording assistance.Such was the result of the expedition. Many others have no doubt answered as little the expectations of those who seduced by deceitful promises have emigrated to America in search of happiness which they could not find abandoning their country their parents and their friends. In July a Hamburgh ship with 106 Swiss passengers was at Lisbon in nearly the same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said here that there is a company in Holland which has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. It heaps them pell mell on board ships and if they reach their destination they are soon con vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes.It would be a desirable thing for papers in countries where these emigrations are excited to insert the article relative to the charter party given above in order that the simple and credulous may see what they have to undergo.,agriculture ID319,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,02,inform,Nassau New England March 12.The red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected.The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.A letter from Great-Ogreechee in Georgia dated December 9th says since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some ill-natured state- bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians.

Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.
