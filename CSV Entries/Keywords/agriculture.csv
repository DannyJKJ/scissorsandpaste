ID3,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,01,05,inform,This morning some dispatches were received from Boston which were brought over in the Sally Capt. Walker from Liverpool. They are dated the 16th November and contain an account of the arrival of several ships from Newfoundland and some from Halifax; that provisions of all kinds were very plentiful and reasonable.ID4,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,13,inform,Our latest accounts from the West Indies say that no supply from the islands either of wheat or flour can possibly be obtained from the American states in consequence of the great bounties given by his Most Christian Majesty on these articles. Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch.The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade.ID5,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from Quebec June 6.We are dreadfully alarmed at present on account of the great scarcity of flour throughout the province. Common flour sold this morning in the market at six dollars per cwt. bran from 7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel and pease 20d. per bushel. There has been an account taken of the quantity of flour and wheat in this city and liberties by order of the Governor and Council and we find there is not more than will serve as ten days. They ar much worse off in the district of Montreal than we are here: We have sent them frequent supplies.Wheat which was found too bad to be shipped last year at three livres now sells at two dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of fifteen hundred pounds by this job.Government for the relief of the poor have caused to be issued by the contractor here rise at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dollar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth in this way.In consequence of letters by last Thursday's post from Montreal two thousand bushels of damaged wheat were shipped yesterday for that market. We have not had a grain of flour from England or the States though we hear of a cargo from New York for Montreal. The vessel was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more than probably that people there being in great want themselves have detained her. The Government have done now what they should have done five or six months ago and then we should not be in this starving condition ; that is we are to have a proclamation to permit the importation of grain and flour from the States.My servant is just come home from the baker's where I had sent him for half a dollar's worth of bread. After watching for two hours till the bread came out of the overn he could get but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves indeed weighing only two pounds each. Thirty-five shillings have been paid for ship biscuit. The Lord knows what will become of us–except Government will distribute some of the flour that is come for the troops in the Queen.Mr. Davidson one of the Council assured us on Thursday last there was not wheat and flourin the country for five weeks. He has taken a great deal of pains to be well informed on the subjuct; and to him are we indebted for the proclamation to allow the importation from the States. He stood forth alone and offered at his own expence to get an account taken of the quantities of wheat and flour in the town and liberties of Quebec and insisted on its being taken into consideration.ID7,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,07,20,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman in Bermuda to his friend in Norfolk Virginia dated April 2.By Captain Gilbert the bearer of this you will learn our distress for want of provi- sions: There has not been in the whole island one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. Capt. George from Baltimore brought in [?] days ago two bushels of corn which sold immeddiately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 360 barrels of flour common and superfine which sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No vessel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. George; and no vessel belonging to the island is expected to relieve us. A great number of poor people have been for ten days past obliged to live on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton by advice of his counsel has opened the port of Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever for thirty days to be computed from the 30th day of March laden with bread corn; or flour. He also allows for three months the importation of salted provisions from any foreign port whatever in vessels belonging to these islands. IT is said what if any foreign vessel should come here after the time permited by proclamation they will be allowed to dispose of their cargo if they can prove they set out with an intent to come here. If any vessels be ready to sail from Norfolk with provisions advise them to call at Bermuda.ID18,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,09,21,persuade,A short DESCRIPTION of and REMARKS upon a new State called THE WESTERN TERRITORY being one of four settled by the Americans since 1774.THAT no nation can serve the Americans with goods equal in quality and price to Britain is wha the whole world knows and from experience the most obstinate rebel American dare not deny: It is with pleasure therefore we inform our readers that the United States are paying more attention to agriculture than to manufactures–They have already laid out four new States since the beginning of their rebellion viz. Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory.About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States.The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami.This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops.In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only!* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.ID22,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Philadelphia Aug. 5.We are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government.ID33,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in America to his friend in Greenock.No doubt Sir you have been expecting this some time a remittance in money for your goods; but as part of them is still on hand I could not properly answer you in cash or bills ; however if you will accept of wheat in return it shall be immediately sent you ; for our wheat crop has been so plentiful that we can supply you with many thousand bolls of an eceeding fine quality ; and to my knowledge there are several ships loading for your market at present.ID34,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,11,inform,The American Congress having declared it to be the interest of the United States to encourage agriculture by the cultivation of large plantations and to purchase their merchandize from Europe have in consequence considerably lowered the duties on such merchandize.They have also resolved to sell four or five millions of acres of land instead of two millions which they sold annually in the States; the produce of which will son suffice to prevent the necessity of circulating paper money any longer.ID36,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Orders are sent to Plymouth for the Echo sloop of war Capt. Drew lately arrived from Newfoundland and now lying in the Sound to get ready for sea and proceed with all possible dispatch to New York–to acquaint the American Merchants that the British ports are open for the importation of American wheat :–It is to be hoped this salutary measure will reduce the present high price of wheat and flour.ID44,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Advices from Baltimore in Maryland say that all the wheat and flour that could be purchased was actually contracted for throughout that fertile province on the 10th of October last for the French market and it was thought the same man–uvre had taken place at New York Philadelphia and Rhode Island.ID51,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,By letters from America dated the 5th ult. we learn that wheat is so great a crop all over the Provinces that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper currency about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Holland than it was four months ago.Two ships laden with American wheat have already arrived at Bristol where the cargoes were immediately purchased by the dealers. Large orders are sent to America for wheat of which there has been a prodigious crop.ID52,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,25,inform,The Americans have refused every kind of supply of grain to the French without the ready money. M. de Mirabeau's scheme of receiving the debt of the United States due to France proves an abortion.ID55,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,In consequence of the order of the Privy council the merchants of Bristol have sent large orders to America for wheat where the crop has been the greatest ever known.ID78,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,By letters from the New York Packet dated October 6 from Philadelphia we learn that there has been a very fine harvest in the Southern States and that the wheat has been wonderfully productive. A very large quantity had been bought up for the Spanish markets. The quality of European goods imported the last season was immense goods selling for considerable loss ; and such will always be the case when the Merchants in England anticipate a ray of fruitfulness of the American Soil.–The appearance of a Spanish war had given them great prospects of commercial advantages and a seven years war is what the Americans were all earnestly wishing for.ID319,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,02,inform,Nassau New England March 12.The red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected.The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.A letter from Great-Ogreechee in Georgia dated December 9th says since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some ill-natured state- bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These however we expect will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State. As to the Creeks Siminoles and other nations adjoining our Western frontier nothing is clearer than that so far from being injurious to us they may henceforward be made useful to the real interests of this State provided the faith of treaties be observed. They now show every disposition to copy our manners arts agriculture and mode of living.ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26.We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured. Such devastation may shortly be expected to take placethat the name of a Shawenese nation will be no more.that on this side the Cumberland mountains please prospects are in view; a general peace is likely to take place with the Southern Tribes; a regular and efficient system of government is about being established under the auspices of Congress: one of the mildest seasons in a temperate and salubrious climate with the most exuberantharvest gives joy to the husband and animates the diligence and industry of all.Extract of a letter from a Gentleman on the Ohio. Since my last the Gentlemen I mentioned to you are forming themselves into a Company for the purpose of building three vessels of force amounting from twenty to forty 24 pounders completely manned and quipped. They purpose loading with tobacco flour &c. and proceed tos ea by the gulph of Mexico with a full determination to punish severely every insult which in violation of treaties may be offered to the American flag sailing down the Mississippi.It is generally supposed they will embark between twelve and fifteen hundred men in orto ??? America's ??? to the navigation of the Mississippi.ID327,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,07,inform,CONGRESS. Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The one track consists of 7000 acres and is divided into 15 plantations of 500 acres each; eight of these plantations are still unsold and are now offered at the low price of 137l. being only 5s. 6d. per acre. The other track counsists of 3086 acres and is to be sold in one lot at 5s. 6d. per acre. There is a fine stream of water running through these two tracks of land which communicates with the great river Ohio so that Mills may be erect.In Fayette County is Lexington where the Courts of the State of Kentucky are held and where all public business is transacted Lexington is in the neighbourhood of these lands and Fayette county is the nearest and most convenient for Philadelphia Baltimore City of Washington &c. The soil of Kentucky is deep and black and lies upon a bed of lime-stone and coal. THe natural grown of the country are large walnuts honey poplar and sugar trees. The surface is covered with blue grass clover and wild rye grape vines running to the tops of the trees. Shrubs and plants grow spontaneously and afford a beautiful blossom of a rich and exquisite fragrance. Cotton and sugar are manufactured to advantage. wheat barley oats flax and hemp yield abundantly; indeed it is assumed that there have been raised 100 bushels upon one acre but the common produce is from 40 to 60 bushels an acre.Owing to the peculiar richness of the soil and fine climate of the country no part of America has been to repidly settled. The returns made to Congress upon 1st May 1792 state them at 76 000. In March 1793 there were upwards of 100000. And from their astonishing increase since they may be estimated at 200000. Eleven years ago Kentucky lay in a forest but now she exhibits an extensive settlement divided into seven populous counties in which are a great number of flourishing towns and contains more inhabitants than are in Georgia Delaware and Rhode Island States. There are about 70 churches in Kentucky and mostly PResbyterians. There is a College; and Schools are established in every town. There is a Printing-office; a Weekly Gazette published. There are Paper Mills O??? Mills ???ing Mills Saw Mills and a great number of Grist Mills. Considerable quantities of Sugar are made from the Sugar Trees. Salt-works are in every part of the country and the inhabitants are supplied at a low price.The taxes upon land are very low. Any person who goes from Europe becomes an American Citizen on his arrival in this new State and is entitled to be elected to any office in the Commonwealth.For farther particulars apply to MR. John Granger writer to the signet; David Niven writer Glasgow; or to Mr. John Finlayson writer Cupar Fife;
