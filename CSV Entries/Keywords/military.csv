The French General after the and endeavoured to bring over a part of the military to his side against the people : He began with subalterns several of whom took a certain oath of attachment which he administered to them ; but when he came to the Major that officer declined saying he had already engaged himself on the side of the people. Incensed at this reply he reviled him in very opprobrious terms and at last laid his cane upon him !Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry he made his next application to the regiment of artillery but with as little success. They informed him that themselves and Culverins were stationed there for the protection of the people and for them only should be used.Driven to the last shift his distress suggested the sorry expedient of having recourse to the people of colour who here form a considerable corps. By a small dose of flattery these people so readily to be caught by a little seeming attention promised to stand by him ; and did so as long as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is till their fears for their own persons became an object of more weighty concern–they then abandoned him.The humiliating familiarities to which he descended to this motley rabble were truly disgusting. He embraced them; called them his enfans and cher amis and practised all the dirty condescensions which those only who are conversant in the praise-worthy art of cajoling can form any conception of.The effect of this conduct was as might be expected insolence–one of this banditti presumed to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the military and the peopl–the consequence was their doughty leader was laid hold of when his trusty defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into confinement and had the pleasure of beholding from the windows of his prison him whom he had inspired with the insolent temerity to strike White suspended on a gibbet.The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled to confer on the measures to be taken on this occasion when ten deputies were chosen to bring the deposed Commander to that part of the island for trial and twelve Judges were chosen to preside at that very important tribunal.Thus stood matters on Thursday last at which time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary and ingenious method of being put between two planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.,military ID76,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,22,entertain,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain with an equal degree of curiosity andamazement.

Some those drafted from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to Lapraire for the purpose of joining the division stationed there ; in consequence of which Major Leprohon belonging to this particular battalion was sent on Tuesday last with 22 attendants to apprehend these refractory persons as deserters.They apprehended four with some opposition ; and on their way to town with them they were followed by a considerable number of persons who rescued one prisoner and threatened that they would next day proceed to the depot at Lapraire and bring away by force from thence the young men of the parish who were there on duty. Accordingly on Wednesday a large body of these people assembled at La Chine with the intention of carrying their threats into execution.Thomas M'Cord Esq. one of the Police Magistrates about four o'clock in the afternoon left town accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regiment and a detachment of the royal artillery with two field-pieces under the command of Major Plenderleath and took post on a point opposite to the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons 87 of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] of about two acres. Mr M'Cord with some other respectable citizens pointed out the impropriety of their conduct and the fate that would unfortunately await their perseverance ; urging them by every persuasion to disperse and return peaceably to their horses and obey the law.They replied that they did not consider the militia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it had not received the Royal sanction ; and that although it might have passed the House of Assembly where it originated it had not obtained the approbation of the other branches of the Legislate ; that the law if really enacted had not been promagated amongst them and that they were not properly made acquainted with it ; as such they could not pay obedience to it.Under this false and unfortunate impression these deluded people persisted ; but at the same time declared with shouts of Vive le Roi that if the Government wanted their services at any time they were ready one and all to come forward with their lives in the defence of their country and that they would prove themselves in the hour of danger to be faithful subjects to a Government to which they were firmly attached by every principle.Finding however that they still persisted in their determination on this particular object Mr M'Cord in his Magisterial capacity read the riot act to them and ordered them to disperse ; which not being complied with a round shot was fired by the artillery but elevated above injury which was returned by the insurgents in a spirited fire with ball deserving of a better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball and grape but still too much elevated to do any harm which was also returned by another discharge from the mob upon which a few direct shots were fired at them (it being nearly dark) by the military which made them disperse and one man was found killed and another wounded it is feared mortally.,military ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28.Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :–Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyThe urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention.But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country.Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms.We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require.Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyFrom the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations.The speech concludes with a call for supplies.ProclamationThe unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government.Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain.[The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.]Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.,military ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec PapersProvincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council–Aug 1.This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said–May it please your ExcellencyHis Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment.In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent.His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent.His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.,military ID109,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1813,10,07,inform,Canada. (From the Quebec Mercury.) Attack on Fort Schlosser. Head-quarters Kingston July 13.By accounts from the army under Major-General De Rottenburg dated the 9th instant the following particulars have been received of a bold and successful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort Schlosser.In the night of the 4th instant a party consisting of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th regiment under Ensign Winder and thirty-four of the militia the whole under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Clarke of the Lincoln militia crossed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser which they reached a little before day-break and completely surprised the guard consisting of two Lieutenants one serjeant and eight privates whom they made prisoners together with three civilians and three of our own subjects found in the Fort.– The party remained in the Fort about one hour loading their boats form the public stores and wharf and brought with them one brass six-pounder 57 stand of arms two and a half kegs of musket ball cartridges 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for boats one gun-boat two batteaux 20 barrels of salt 17 casks tobacco eight barrels of pork and one barrel of whiskey with a number of spades oars and axes ; a small party of the enemy had collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore and several shots were fired but the boats returned to Chippawa with their prisoners and the articles they had captured without a man being hurt on this service. Further accounts have also been received from the army highly creditable to the Indian warriors serving with it. On the 8th instant a party of the King's regiment and a body of Indian warriors were sent to endeavour to recover a considerable quantity of medicines and surgical instruments which had been buried near the Fort George when our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in consequence between the Indians and the enemy in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men killed and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medicines and instruments were brought off by the party of the King's; the only loss sustained being three Indians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons for reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were deposited and conducting the party to it.A few nights ago the barracks at Gravelly Point burnt by our gun-boats and more than 100 barrels of pork flour and other articles brought away from thence together with a very fine Durham boat–500 oars colleced and partly loaded in her for Sacket's Harbour being destroyed.Attack on Black Rock Head-quarters Kingston July 15 1813.G. O.–His Excellency the Commander of the forces has received a dispatch from Major General De Rottenburg reporting a successful attack upon the enemy's post and dockyard at Black Rock at daybreak on the morning of the 11th inst. by detachments of the King's and 41st regiments together with Liutenant Fitzgibbon's party of the 49th and about 40 militia the whole amounting to 240 men under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. The enemy's position was carried by a spirited attack without the loss of a single man. Several large boats loaded with stores and provisions and three field pieces a twelve and two six-pounders were brought away ; a vessel and all the naval store-houses and barracks have been burnt.Unfortunately before the evacuation of the post was completed a strong reinforcement of the enemy aided by Indians pressed this small detachment by which Captain Saunders of the 41st and 15 men were killed ; Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp Lieutenant Montpesson of the 41st and 15 rank and file wound ed. The wounded were brought over.Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp has received three wounds severe but not considered dangerous.By his Excellency's commandEdward Baynes Adjutant-GeneralBritish Expedition to PlattsburghThe following is an extract of a letter from a respectable citizen at Burlington dated Aug. 1. 1813An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th July with intelligence that the British had left the Isle au Noix with a force consisting of the two armed sloops of 11 guns each and four gallies of one gun each and 100 batteaux full of men and had progressed within one mile of the town. The camp was instantly alarmed and the troops under arms but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that about 1000 troops under the command of Colonel Murray had landed and took possession of Plattsburgh without opposition there being no force to oppose them except the militia of the town and vicinity who being only 400 in number retreated as the enemy advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State Pike's encampment barracks at Serenac cantonment and every building belonging to the United States were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 50000 dollars.

Messrs Lawe M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected that the inhabitants would have joined the Americans.General Dearborn resigned the command of the Niagara army on the 23th June on account of indisposition. General Lewis says in his dispatch to Secretary at War that he did not think the General would ever again be fit for service ; that the unfortunate events of the war had deranged his understanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state of convalescence he uniformly relapsed when military topics were alluded to. General Lewis having been nominated to command at Sacket's Harbour is succeeded at Fort George Niagara and on the Canadian frontier by General Boyd.The Indian chief Tecumseh has seized the favourable moment of the diversion by our shipping in Virginia for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the possibility of receiving supplies. General Clay who commanded there had written urgently to General Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting his army to march to his relief.Sir James Yeo after the retreat of the enemy's army at Fort George swept the American side of Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great Sodus and took the whole of the provisions consisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At Genessee River he inflicted the same loss on the enemy taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels of corn. The provisions were delivered to General Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were embarked on board the fleet to serve as marinersThere were at Quebec on the 22d July 1000 American prisoners of war captured since the commencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 50 officers including three General. In consequence of the conduct of the American Government and of the officers the latter are no longer permitted to return home on parole.

The commercial world is flourishing here but in political matters I am sorry to say we are sadly in the back ground. The old defensive system is still adhered to and I fear much with all our reinforcements we shall do little good till we have another commander in chief. There is now a great body of regular troops in this country and a handful of brave fellows have recently been almost sacrificed par la petite guerre at Chippawa whilst in the lower province there are at least 10000 regulars doing nothing.Some of the officers of the regiments lately arrived from France do not conceal their sentiments– On inspecting one of the regiments the other day our chief took occasion as usual to make some remarks on the cut of the men's clothes when the Colonel commanding stepped forward and told him plainly that such systems were now completely exploded–that he had had the honour of serving very lately under a much more celebratedGeneral that it was probable he would ever serve under again–that his men had been accustomed to fight not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was called on to follow he should certainly retire from the service. Such language you may suppose was not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy to find that we now have military men amongst us who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the numberless representations of civilians are not much attended to.Montreal July 14. I consider this country now as perfectly secure against any attempts that the Americans may make not withstanding the system of our chief does not seem to be changed. He has received a great many more troops this year than he had any idea of and does not seem pleased at having so large a force unhis command as the country will now look to him for some offensive operation against the enemy. He has done nothing the whole summer but parade about 6000 men at Chambly where he makes them march past him twice a-week bowing and scraping instead of employing them where they ought to be.You will have heard of an American army of about 6000 under General Jacob Brown having crossed the river at Fort Erie when General Rial with a force of 1500 only gallantly assailed them but was overpowered by numbers and sustained considerable loss. I inclose a general order published yesterday about this unfortunate business whereby you will find that our loss has been great.Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly any force and it appears very singular indeed that so great a body of men as are now on the other side of the river from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix at least 10000 men should be left for the purpose of parade when they are so much wanted in the upper province.I sincerely hope that some investigation will take place into this business as it is really disgraceful to think that such an enemy should be able to make an attack upon us with impunity.,military ID114,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,10,15,inform,Private CorrespondenceQuebec Sept. 10.

The attack was made in three columns under Colonel Scott of the 103d regiment Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment and Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two former were directed to scale the fort and the latter to get possession of a small hill named Snake-Hill which the Americans had fortified and being situated only about eight hundred yards from Fort Erie was of consequence to us. This latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns destined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses inside the fort when their own guns were turned against them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place which blew up the magazine and battery and with them a number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused by this was so great and we were obliged to abandon our conquest and retreat to our original position with great loss of both officers and men.The large ship-building by the British at Kingston on Lake Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– also will carry about 100 guns.The battalion of royal marines commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Williams and which has been stationed lately at Isle au Noix and parts adjacent have been broken up and distributed among the fleets on the Lakes.
