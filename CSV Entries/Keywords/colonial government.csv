His Grace died at Spanish Town July 4th 1736 in the 45th year of his age.The death of these two Noblemen in their government gave so bad an impression of the climate of Jamaica and the insalubrity of its air that few persons of rank and fortune have been ambitious of becoming governors of it notwith standing the brilliancy of the appointments an nexd to the situation.,colonial government ID65,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,12,entertain,By the last letters from India we understand they were going on in the plodding way with nothing new or important.–The markets are overstocked with British goods so as to enable our countrymen to supply themselves with most articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever who is expected to remain another year among them to the no small regret of those who left England for the sake of Oriental wealth.Our female adventurers have also found it a bad market ; British beauty never fails of finding its admirers ; but the late restriction in the East have rendered wives forbidden fruit of which neither civil nor military dare to think of tasting.,colonial government ID103,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1810,06,09,inform,Canada Extract of a letter from a Gentleman to his Friend in GlasgowQuebec March 23 1810.–A number of leading characters among the Canadians who were Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissolved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a French paper called La Canadien have been arrested and thrown into jail upon a charge of treasonable and seditious practises ; the printing press types &c. also taken possession of. This vigorous measure of Sir James Craig has astonished the Canadians not a little but the consequences will be no doubt beneficial to the country as it has crushed a faction which has for some years been gaining strength and acquiring dangerous influence over the minds of the inhabitants who are without education and ignorant of course in the extreme ; therefore easily misled by demagogues among their countrymen who seize every opportunity of stirring up all those prejudices which the people of this country naturally have against the British : for having been allowed to preserve their language they are nearly as much Frenchmen now as they were at the conquest.Quebec March 22.–On Sunday afternoon the printer of the Canadien Mr Charles Lafrancois was arrested and committed to jail under a warrant from the Executive Council on a charge of treasonable practises. On Monday evening Dr Blanchet and Mr Bedard and last evening Mr T. Taschereau were also arrested and committed by the same authority on the same charges.The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an elegant dinner at head-quarters on the 4th curt. to celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of the Nobility and Gentry Generals and Field-Officers of the army were present.Among the other accidents that occurred on the King's birth-day from the imprudent use of gunpowder is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– Her clothes were set fire by a squib and although immediately taken to the Infirmary was so severely burnt that she died before morning.A very melancholy accident happened at a place called the Pease Berwickshire. As one of the baggage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping there a fine boy about eight years of age belonging to Serjeant-Major Nicol got out of the cart and was climbing on the wheel when the horses suddengoing off threw him on the ground and the wheel passing over his body crushed him to death. The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this unhappy accident happened.On Thursday night a spirit shop in Gibson-street Glasgow was broken into and about five pounds in silver a seven shilling piece about eight shillings of copper a counterfeit half-guinea and a pocket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; some partial payments are marked on the bills. The villains appear to have entered the shop by forcing up the window shutter with an iron bar and then breaking a pane of glass by which they got the iron bolts and the window opened.On Saturday last a porter was killed in the hold of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pully was supported giving way the measure fell down upon him and killed him instantly.A few days ago a mason of the name of Stevenson was killed by the blowing up of some stones at Templeton in the parish of Auchterhouse. The match unfortunately communicated too early to the powder and the explosion took place before he could get out of the way. He has left a wife and two children to lament his loss.,colonial government ID105,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Upper Canada York July 28.Yesterday at an early hour his Honour Isaac Brock Esq. administering the Government of Upper Canada and Major-General commanding his Majesty's forces therein arrived at this place from Fort-George and accompanied by a numerous suite proceeded to the Government Building at four p.m. when he opened the present extra session of the Legislature and delivered the following speech to both houses :–Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyThe urgency of the present crisis is the only consideration which would have induced me to call you together at a time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand your care and attention.But Gentlemen when invaded by an enemy whose avowed object is the entire conquest of this province the voice of loyalty as well as of interest calls aloud to every person in the sphere in which he is placed to defend his country.Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; they have evinced by the promptitude and loyalty of their conduct that they are worthy of the King whom they serve and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me particular satisfaction that while I address you as Legislators I speak to mean who in the day of danger will be ready to assist not only with their counsels but with their arms.We look Gentlemen to our militia as well as to the regular forces for our protection ; but I should be wanting to that important trust committed to my care if I attempted to conceal (what experience the great instructor of mankind especially of legislators has discovered) that amendment in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is for you to consider what further improvements they still may require.Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the House of AssemblyFrom the history and experience of our mother country we learn that in times of actual invasion or internal commotion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private treachery as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws restraining for a limited period the liberty of individuals in many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the particulars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the province might justify me in the exercise of the full power reposed in me on such an emergency yet it will be more agreeable to me to receive the sanction of the Houses.A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of this province is such as to authorise a just expectation that their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– The disaffected I am convinced are few–To protect and defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations is an object worthy of your most serious deliberations.The speech concludes with a call for supplies.ProclamationThe unprovoked declaration of war by the United States of America against the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and its dependencies has been followed by the actual invasion of this province in a remote frontier of the western districts by a detachment of the United States. The officer commanding that detachment has thought proper to invite his Majesty's subjects not merely to a quiet and unresisting submission but insults them with a call to seek voluntarily the protection of his Government.Without condescending to repeat the illiberal epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American Commander to the people of Upper Canada on the administration of his Majesty every inhabitant of the province is desired to seek the confutation of such indecent slander in the review of his own particular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian subject who can truly affirm to himself that he has been injured by the Government in his person his property or his liberty? Where is to be found in any part of the world a growth so paid in prosperity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled not thirty years by a band of veterans exiled from their former possessions on account of their loyalty not a descendant of these brave people it to be found who under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. This unequalled prosperity would not have been attained by the utmost liberality of the Government or the persevering industry of the people had not the maritime power of the mother country secured to its colonists a safe access to every market where the produce of their labour was in request. The unavoidable and immediate consequence of a separation from Great Britain must be the loss of this inestimable advantage and what is offered to you in exchange? To become a territory of the United States and share with them that exclusion from the ocean which the policy of their Government enforces ; you are not even flattered with a participation of their boasted independence ; and it is but too obvious that once exchanged from the powerful protection of the United Kingdom you must be re-annexed to the dominion of France from which the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and treasure from no other motive than to relieve her ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire of France was the stipulated reward for the aid afforded to the revolted colonies now the United States ; the debt is still due and there can be no doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consideration for commercial advantages or rather for an expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over the commercial world. Are you prepared inhabitants of Canada to become willing subjects or rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of Europe with a rod of iron? If not arise in a body exert your energies co-operate cordially with the King's regular forces to repel the invader and do not give cause to your children when groaning under the oppression of a foreign master to reproach you with having too easily parted with the richest inheritance of this earth–a participation in the name character and freedom of Britain.[The proclamation concludes with a declaration that should the Americans refused quarter in consequence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take place.]Isaac Brock Major-Gen. and President Head-quarters Fort George July 22 1812.,colonial government ID106,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1812,10,03,inform,Quebec PapersProvincial Parliament of Lower Canada Legislative Council–Aug 1.This day at two o'clock his Excellency the Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the Legislative Council Chamber and being seated on the Throne the Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod was sent to command the presence of the Assembly which being come up the Honourable Speaker of the Assembly said–May it please your ExcellencyHis Majesty's faithful subjects the representatives of the province of Lower Canada have passed a bill intituled An Act of facilitate the Circulation of Army Bills. Their loyalty and the happiness of this province in being connected with and powerfully protected by the British nation are the basis of their constitution and the just grounds which gave rise to the formation of the militia and the firm determination to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust war that the United States have lately declared ; they are therefore under the greatest obligation to your Excellency for having communicated to them your wise precautions on the means to ameliorate and insure for several years the punctual payment of the army by circulating bills the reimbursement of which is guaranteed in England. To give them greater credit the bill limits the sums necessary and moreover provides for the interest the advantages accruing therefrom and even for the payment of the principal in specie in this province which has become expressly bound for the same at a fixed period to any person whatever who from the state of his private affairs would prefer such payment.In full confidence that under the present and any unforeseen circumstance your Excellency is invested with all necessary authority the representatives of the province and their constituents rely on the wisdom already experienced of your administration and in the name of the Commons of Lower Canada I have the honour to present this bill to your Excellency humbly requesting thereto his Majesty's assent.His Excellency was pleased to signify the Royal assent.His Excellency then addressed both Houses and the Provincial Parliament was prorogued to the 16th of September.,colonial government ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26.We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured. Such devastation may shortly be expected to take placethat the name of a Shawenese nation will be no more.that on this side the Cumberland mountains please prospects are in view; a general peace is likely to take place with the Southern Tribes; a regular and efficient system of government is about being established under the auspices of Congress: one of the mildest seasons in a temperate and salubrious climate with the most exuberantharvest gives joy to the husband and animates the diligence and industry of all.Extract of a letter from a Gentleman on the Ohio.

Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The Legislature have also resolved that a Convention be called for taking into consideration the constitution of the United States; the members to be elected in December and the Convention to Meet the first week in Jauary. The Legislature have adjourned to meet again on the first Thursday in January for the purpose (we suppose) of choosing Senators and affixing the time and manner of electing Representatives for Congress.New York Nov. 18.The following resolution has passed the House of Representatives of the State of Virginia now in session: Resolved That so much of this act entitled An Act making provision for the provision for the debt of the United States in their redemption of the public debt is dangerous to the rights and subversive of the interest of the people; and demands the marked disapprobation of the General Assembly.Portland Nov. 15.The stone work of the light house at the entrance of our harbour is now completed. On Tuesday the 9th instant the last stone was laid by Mr. Nichols of this town master builder. The work is extremely well executed. The lighthouse is now 70 feet high.

The lanthorn is now preparing and will probably be raised and lighted by the first of next month.Baltimore Nov. 23.A society of respectable gentlemen of this place have raised an adequate fund for the establishment of an extensive manufacture of gunpowder and the necessary mill-works will be speedily erected in the vicinity of this town. This important insituation will not only prove highly advantageous to this State and town but may if properly encouraged become a national benefit.York (Pennsylvania) Nov 10. From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the ??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury.Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13.One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment. How the State can pacify the Indians now Heaven knows while at this moment the other murderers are at large in this country and no one will arrest them.,colonial government ID335,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,09,inform,Halifax April 6.The late violent rains have done much damage in the country:–The bridge at Sackville is nearly torn down and the Mill there is much injured: the Bridge at Nine Mills River is partly carried away; and the different roads and causeways are supposed to have suffered more than 2000l. will repair.Since the retreat of the f–eral troops under General Harmar the Miami Indians have committed unparalleled cruelties.
