ID57,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Charles Town South Carolina September 2 1789 to a friend in Bristol.My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the water that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched have I been at times that I can hardly support the regret I feel that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation England for the dreary the desolate scenes of America.Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State. They are all in the secret sighing for the comforts of Old England. A bare pittance there would be preferable to the largest possessions here.ID63,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,01,04,inform,November 12. On Thursday last the Viscount de Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and ball to a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of this town on board l'Illustre of seventy-four guns. The boats of the fleet the state yacht and barge received the company at Foster's wharf before 12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first boat having ladies on board a signal gun was fired from l'Illustre and in an instant the squadron was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all nations. On arriving at the ship the company were very politely received by the Viscount and conducted to the state room–the marines saluting as the company passed them. At one o'clock the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with a profusion of luxuries and delicacies in a hall erected for the occasion which was very fancifully decorated. At the head of the table was a castle of pastry having thirteen metal guns by which from tubes that communicated through the table and the company were saluted with a f–deral dis charge. On the top of the castle waved a small white ensign–the device two hearts–the motto The United hearts of America and France. The head of the hall was ornamented with a heart pieced with arrows–and in the motton Homage to the fair daughters of America a fine compliment made by the noble Viscount to his female guests. After dinner the ball began and closed before nine o'clock and on departure his Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let off from a boat moored at some distance from the ship.Rhode Island and North Carolina yet remain averse to the new government; they refuse allegiance to all acts of the States and of course do not participate in any privilee; they are treated in respect to port entries &c. as foreign States.ID90,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,inform,CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller.The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his sons by writing and accounts to become servants of the Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ who were very ill paid. Their salaries indeed were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of such a conduct was that each became a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house. The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale ; and those who ranked high in government and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to their names felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed avowedly but through the medium of their slaves. In fact the minds of every class the Governor the Clergy the F[?]l and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted were wholly bent on trade. Knopman or merchant was a title that conferred rank at the Cape to which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese who have degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society.That portion of the day not employed in the concerns of trade is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste for reading and none for the cultivation of the fine arts.–They have no kind of public amusements except occasional balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which usually consist of card playing or dancing. Money-matters and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are opulent though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole colony and but a few who are objects of public cha rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities from alms donations and collections made after divine service and not from any tax laid upon the public. Except indeed a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works the inhabitants of the Cape have little drawback on their profits on the produce of their labour.It has been the remark of most travellers that the ladies of the Cape are pretty lively and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women in the same family is inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in their shape awkward in in their carriage and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter are generally of a small delicate form below the middle size of easy and unaffected manners well dressed and fond of social intercourse; an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents and which they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on and less subject to the caprice of parents than else where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children male and female share alike in the family property. No parent can disinherit a child without assigning on proof on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian Code.By the law of the colony a community of all property both real and personal is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists the children on the death of either parent are entitled to that half of the joint property which was supposed to belong to the deceased and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age.It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords. In the better families most of them are taught music and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. Many understand the French language and some have made great proficiency in the English. They are expert at the needle and all kinds of lace knotting and tambour work and in general make up their own dresses following the prevailing fashion of England brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to India from whom they may be said to Catch the manners living as they riseNeither are the other sex while boys deficient in vivacity or talent ; but for want of the means of a proper education to open their minds and excite in them a desire of knowledge they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating smoaking [sic] and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate with the English except such as hold employments under the Government. This backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations and partly perhaps to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel in mixing with their conquerors.ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.–There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million inproduce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar.Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits.I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke.There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand–25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.–Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.
