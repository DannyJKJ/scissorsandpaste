Vermont Kentucky Indiana and The Western Territory.About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wilderness; they only began to settle it about the year 1774. Kentucky ten years ago lay in forest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid has been the population that there are not less than one hundred thousand inhabitants already in each of these states. The State of Indiana was only laid off this present year in 1789 and contains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From a description of these four States published in America in May last we give our readers a short abridged description of the last of them called The Western Territory; and it must rerejoice the heart of every Briton to read it and think that the settling of these countries though the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 20 years will long keep them from manufacturing and is every day opening a field for new customers to Great Britain; for who will work as a tradesman even though wages are very high when he can for twenty pounds purchase a thousand acres of land that being the present price fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufactures will continually increase with the increasing population of America.–Desponding politicians may derive comfort from the prospect that new channels of commerce will be opened and the inland parts of the Continent will require an increasing supply.–British manufactures will for ages ascend the great rivers of that Continent and by means of a most extraordinary inland navigation will be diffused through a country more fertile more extensive than all the Thirteen United States.The Western Territory Is the name given to this new State by Congress. It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river –north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania? south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains according to Mr. Hutchins Geographer General to the Congress 411000 square miles equal to two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres from which he deducts forth-three millions of acres for water; there will then remain two hundred and twenty millions of acres belonging to the fed–ral government which is to be sold for the discharge of the debt owing to the United States. But a very small proportion of these lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and disposed of by Congress*.On the lands which have been purchased by Congress from the Indians two settlements are already commenced–one at Marietta the other at Miami.This State was only laid out by Congress in the end of the year 1787 and already contains above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are the Mississippi Ohio Muskingham Hockhocking Sioto Miami Wobash&c–Coal and iron mines and salt pits abound in this State; the soil is excellent?as rich as can be imagined and may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy pleasant and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth known to the Europeans or Americans–exceeding the soil of any of the United States. The timber is tall and in great variety?Streams for mills abound here. Wheat indigo hemp and cotton thrive well. Many years will probably not escape before a good part of the country will be brought to that degree of cultivation that will exhibit all its latent beauties and fulfill the description of travellers who call it the garden of the world. It is here probably also that the center of a great empire will be fixed in some future period. It is the most centrical place for Congress to accommodate themselves at. No country is better stocked with wild game of every kind; herds of deers elks bears &c fill the extensive meadows of thie country?turkies geese swans and partridges &c. are innumerable. The rivers are excellently stored with fish and almost all navigable for small sloops.In the ordinance published by Congress for the government of this territory they are to be allowed an Assembly when their number amounts to 30000 persons; and when they acquire a certain degree of population they are to have representatives in Congress; and when fifty millions of acres are settled they are to be divided into States.Rejoice O Britons! that they must all be supplied with manufactures by you and you only!* No more than about twelve millions of acres have yet been purchased of the poor natives for which Congress gave them only eight thousand dollars value in goods and rum.,Native Americans ID23,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Albany Aug. 10.By a gentleman who arrived in this city on Friday last from the county of Ontario in the Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we are informed that four days before he left that county Colonel Brant from Niagara at the head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal Sachems and other Indians of the Six Nations had arrived at Conadoque the seat of Oliver Phelps Esq; on a visit of friendship and at the same time to receive the money due them for the lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque four miles from that place and conducted into town –That they were highly gratified with the treatment they received and with the manner in which they had disposed of their lands.–The gentleman further informs that there is now about 3000 inhabitants in the above county and that the land is of a good quality.,Native Americans ID28,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,23,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Danville(Kentucky) to his friend in BaltimoreIt is with great concern I communicate to you the following truly melancholy intelligence: –About three weeks ago Mr. Richard Chenoweth had six or eight men allowed him by the officer of the garrison at the Falls to guard his exposed plantation in Bear Crab Settlement below the Falls. In the evening of their arrival before they had taken their station as a guard a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's house killed two of the soldiers and three of Mr. Chenoweth's children and tomahawked and scalped his wife leaving her on the floor for dead– Mr. Chenoweth (who had his arm broke by the savages) with the rest of the men made their escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's children sick in a chamber and it is reported she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; but next morning crawling down stairs she was inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved parent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned next day to his house and carried his wife to a neighbouring plantation where they are both likely to recover and what is remarkable she wants to return to her own house.–The savages have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. –A small company are gone to White River to extirpate 80 or 90 Indians who as spies have informed have upwards of 300 horses &c. at that place.,Native Americans ID29,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,23,inform,Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Pittsburgh to his friend in Philadelphia dated Sept. 2.The Indians have killed six soldiers at the mouth of Little Sandy Creek below the Great Kanawa where the New Englanders were forming a settlement.,Native Americans ID46,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,18,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia Aug. 23.Congress is still sitting at New York and from the multiplicity of business before them there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. We are curious to know what foreigners will sayof our new commercial arrangements. Among ourselves there is but one opinion and that is faavourable. o our own vessels a preference is undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and merchandise there is no discrimination in our import and tonnage acts every nation being on the same footing. With respect to the duties themselves they could not be laid lower considering the demand of supplies which the Committee appointed to give in an estimate state at upwards of eight millions of dollars.Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of improvement in politics and commerce we feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expecttion of the f–deral government's acting with the energy and effect that will give it respectability. The prejudices and animosities created by the late contest are gradually dying away ; and to the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same source industry has in a great degree succeeded. A progress has also been made in manufactures of various kinds that was not expected ; and the persevering in them affords a strong presumption of those concerned deriving advantage.Throughout the union the public opinion on matters of government has of late experienced rapid changes. Vice President Adams in his highly esteemed work has fully demonstrated the absurdity of democracy and the superior excellence of a mix form such as that of Britain. His deductions from premises admitted as just have abated much of the popular aversion to monarchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in our transatlantic soil it would not surprise many were United America to have a sovereign earin the next century.In no one instance has our new admnistration given general satisfaction more than in their conduct towards the Indians. The interests of those unfortunate people will be studiously attended to ; and they will be effectually protected against the lawless violence of the individuals or States who wished to wrest their lands from them. This determination is dictated by policy as well humanity ; for it is now become the interest of the States to check by every means short of violence the erratic disposition of their citizens who when removed to the wilds beyond the mountains cannot be regarded as of any value in a political view.,Native Americans ID62,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,01,04,inform,October 31. We are informed by very respectable authority that Mr. M'Gillvry has written to the President of the United States a full and sensible account of the rise and progress of the disputes subsisting between the Georgians; from which statement he expected to prove to a demonstration that he has not acted the inconsistent part which some have alleged neither has there been such cruelties committed by the Indians.From Mr. M'Gillevry's abilities and considering he was educated in Europe being the son of a Scotchman and Indian women we have no reason to expect any savage cruelties from an of his people; but on the contrary it is rather to be presumed that his proposals which are contained in his letter to the President are of a rational nature and many probably bring about a final and an advantageous treaty with the United States.,Native Americans ID68,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,07,09,inform,We have this day received Quebec newspapers down to the 24th May from which the following is extracted:–Quebec May 20.We hear late accounts from Niagara mention that the Indians in that quarter are much alarmed in consequence of a message said to be received by them from the States that they had now raised an army to take their own for Niagara and that two thousand men of that army were now on their way from New York–desiring the Indians to lye still and look on and that they would punish those that should interfere.It was also said that the people of New York were determined of themselves to lay open the post of Oswego and that emissaries had been employed to persuade the Indians they would be greatly benefited by that event.We are rather inclined to believe the Indians are too sensible of the great benefits already conferred upon them by our neighbours in buying their lands from them to think of accepting any more from that quarter and we would recommend it to the new-born Sovereignty on this side the Atlantic before they testify their impatience that national treaties like private agreements are not to be infringed by one and performed by the other party–Pay and you shall receive.[As to the Americans making an attempt upon Niagara they have long had it in contemplation to get possession of our posts upon the lakes in Canada.]May 24.The concerned in the ship Columbia and sloop Washington have received letters from the Captian Kendrick dated at Nootka in July last; he informs them that he passed the winter preceding on the north-west coast of America; that he was then bound on a voyage further northward and from thence intended to proceed to Canton.– The letters were forwarded to Mexico by a Spanish fleet that had been at Nootka and from thence to the Spanish Charge des Affaires at New York. They were covered to the President of the United States of America.[From what appeared in our paper of Friday last (see Glasgow Intelligence p. 424) and what is mentioned above it seems very probable that the affair of Nootka Sound had been a preconcerted scheme between the Americans and Spaniards as Capt. Kendrick addresses his dispatches for the President of the States without making the least mention (from what is made public) of any British ships being then at Nootka Sound.],Native Americans ID69,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,08,16,inform,By recent letters from America we learn that the Congress of the nited States after warm debates in both Houses particularly in that of the Representatives passed an act for the purpose of fixing permanently their seat of Government at German Town in Pennsylvania.The two new provinces in North America Kentucky and Vermont whose population already is so very considerable were formed by the vast numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruction and ravages of the unhappy contest between Great Britain and her colonies and though the greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists yet they have now jooined the American confederation. Seated on the banks of the great river Mississippi far to the westward of all the other states they can either navigate northerly to the lakes or southerly to the Spanish settlements on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico and carry on a lucrative trade with the Indians. They are possessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the world the position of which they ??? also s???d by navigable rivers to Maryland Virginia and Pennsylvania and from thence as their views ???tend to every country in Europe. Thus from the most distressed situation to rise to opulence and independence ina few years must excite admiration.Agriculture at present seems to be the peculiar province of American industry from whence wealth will flow into every part of that vast country as it abounds in large tracts of rich land level grounds with a deep soil and extended savannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of an equal fertility; and though not so abundant in coin yet the provinces produce the finest meadows form whence a provision trade will be every year increasing. The southern countries of Europe not affording sufficient crops of grain for the support of their inhabitants on account of the remarkable encrease of population and which is still augmenting as arts and manufacturers are every where extended: America may therefore be deemed in future the granary of this quarter of the globe.,Native Americans ID73,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,19,entertain,Court of Chancery. TheKing at the relation of theBishopofLondon versusAndersonandGipps.On the 18th of June 1692 the Hon. Mr. Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid out in lands in Yorkshire out of the rents of which the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the College of William and Mary in New England to be applied for the purpose of propagating the Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back settlements in North America ; and likewise a further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College for the support of two missionaries to preach the gospel. The city of London were left trustees and the management under the trust was by the will committed to the care of the Bishop of London. The present Bishop instituted this suit in which the city and a great number of other persons were parties for the single and indeed novel purpose of knowing whether (as the teststor had originally devised the several sums for the use of British subjects and the Americans having ceased to be in that situations since their independence) the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom or to some other of his Majesty's colonies to be applied to similar purposes. This being the first determination of that nature since the American Revolution the Lord Chancellor decided it with that superior dignity of sentiment that always attends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– all charitable devices are to be held sacred– we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead in search of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears must be paid and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps and likewise the city of London must be paid their costs.,Native Americans ID80,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,26,inform,When the Cherokee Chiefs first visited Coventgarden Theatre one of them appeared much delighted with the splendid appearance of an Indian cap worn by one of the pantomime actors; this being observed the performer was directed the performance; the Chief amazed at the offer of the magnificent present said through his interpreter that even in his won country he should be unable to repay it ; however at present he would do the utmost in his power ; on this he ordered the actor to approach him and then lighting his Cherokee pipe stuffed with a variety of nauseous combustibles he too three whiffs himself and presenting the tube desired the actor to take three whiffs also–the greatest favour a Cherokee could confer ; the actor aastonished at the singularity of this unexpected honour reluctantly complied with the requestto the great entertainment of the Dramatic circle.,Native Americans ID85,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,12,13,inform,THE INDIANS.IT is our wish in imitation of other newswritters to give now and then an account of such new publications as deserve the attention of the public; but in a paper pubished only twice a week where so much naturally occurs under the article of temporary news it is but seldom we can find room for this purpose:–when however any ting remarkable appears in the literary world we never fail to notice it although it may not be in our power to give an extensive and critical account of its excellencies. We take up the pen with real pleasure at present to announce the publication of a tragedy intitled THE INDIANS the reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this University. The great applause with which this play was received when performed at Richmond Theatre has raised the expectations of those who were not present at the performance to the highest pitch; and we think we may take upon ourselves to assert that upon perusing it even their highest expetations will not be disappointed.– The plot of the piece is taken from a well known story published at the end of a volum of poems written by the same gentleman. In the choice of a plot where so many dramatic writers of respectable talents have erred our author is peculiarly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of Horace:Denique sit quid vis simplex dumtaxat et unum.It is simple and yet it does not disgust by an appearance of nakedness.–It is one for the complaints of Maraino and the return of Oniyo form a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and defeat of those arts an end which combined wake up a compleat and connected whole. In the delineation of character the author has on al every occasion attended to the quid quemque decent–there are hoever some few parts which the critic halts to consider but which amidst so many beauties he blushes to censure–Some lines for instance in the character of Ononthio do not strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem as to prompt him to spare a victim about to be destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; that victim a captive of war and not only so but a Briton who has been fighting against his coun- trymen amongst whom was his only son whom he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much in favour of a stranger and a foe at the risk of displeasing the village and consequently of losing his power? Or is it likely that he would have greater influence with the superstitious crowd than he who was deemed of skill to bend to his purpose the demons that sway the fortune of mankind?–Another question concenring Ononthio and we leave him. Is it consistent with the phlisophic firmness of the Sachem so to despair on receiving news of his son's death as to declare that he should know no comfort but to die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave Maraino at such a period of distress when she most stood in need of his kind offices?–The first and best supported character in the piece is that of Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence of Ononthio her unaffected piety and her humanity in intfering to save an unknown captive from death are pleasing ??? which give ??? an insight into her nature. In the breast of Mariano every thing is subordinate to her love for Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is properly kept in view during the course of the piece. But even in this master-piece the author has perhaps once deviated a little from nature. The sentiments Maraino utters during the conversation with Sydney in the fifth act are rather those of a Phiosopher and Divine than a young creature the chorus of whole heart are tuned to the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can she who had lately discovered a long lost brother talk so coldly in his presence; Can she who had so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband so entirely banish his imag from her mind as to converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gentle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this one exception the part of which we are speaking is finely drawn and highly intersting.–The language of the piece is every where elegant and in many places where the sentiment requires it sublime. The uathor has requently dignified his verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this in general produces a good effect–but there is a danger of using them too often and of chusing them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult talk where all is so excellent to refer to any particular passage of scene as deserving most notice: it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. If there is any preference to be given it is perhaps to that scene in the 2d act where Onaiyo gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and the scene in the 4th act where Maraino is prompted by Neidan to slay her brother–who proves his innocence by the production of her husband's belt the sight of which draws an elegant speech from the enraptured fair. This scene however would be improved did it conclude with something more apt to the joyful moment than the solemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in itself and containing a very fine sentiment Sed nunc non erat his locus.–Upon the whole the tragedy upon which we have guided by impartiality spoken so freely is in our opinion far superior to most of those plays which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevitably please.,Native Americans ID86,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,02,01,inform,Advice from Charlestown South Carolina says that the Indians in Washington county commit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. They have set fire to several houses; and a woman who had a sick husband telling them from a window of her calamity they shot her dead on the spot and then set fire to the spot. The sick man was consequently burnt.A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on a part of the American frontiers. This gentleman with two hundred men even went into the very heart of an Indian settlement and defeated the savages. He then penetrated the country destroying all before him and returned without the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledgement was made of his services and bravery and a liberal subscription made for his gallant little army.,Native Americans ID87,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,23,inform,QUEBEC December 2 1790 Yesterday's post from Montreal conveyed letters to several gentlemen in town all corroboratiing the following extract.SIR I have to inform you by several letters received here on Saturday from Detroit we are informed the Americans under General Sinclair had been twice defeated about the 19th ult. with the loss of from 500 to 600 men by the Indians The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse which they had drawn into a snare and cut the whole of them off. In a second engagement they were likewise victorious having nearly killed as many. On account of which Sinclair thought proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the Indians having divided themselves into small parties had so harrassed him that he was obliged to leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his artillery a cohorn and grass-hopper. It is said the Indians are very much elated at their success and that numbers were daily joining them at their head quarters about the Maimis towns– One Indian it is said killed 30 with his own hand.The Indians were extremely civil to the traders from Detriot having assisted them when they knew of the approach of the Americans to remove their property to safety except ammunition and arms. These are facts so well ascertained that there does not remain the least doubt of them:They may be attended with very serious and important consequences to the province as I dare say all will be imputed to the British for supplying these Indians with arms and ammunition.– In short I would not be surprized to hear of an American army raising to attack this country. * The loss is here specified but other letters differing in number we shall only say the estimate in general does not appear considerable.,Native Americans ID92,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,14,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 1792 gives an impartial account of the situation of tha country we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesIT is some abatement of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated:You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable purposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the event or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally that such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thus far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favorable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by anything that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed that besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the Tennessee River have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treaty of Holston made with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive precautions only have been enjoined and observed.It is not understood that any breach of treaty or aggression whatsoever on the part of the United States or their citizens is even alleged as a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete and pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expense of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition of no material extension of the spirit of hostilities.I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by competent rewards the employment of qualified and trusty persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue has been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United States. These impediments have lessened and are lessened in local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law appears to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in certain quarters I judged a special interposition on my part proper and advisable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for their object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend upon me shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of the laws. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full cooperation of the other departments of the Government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I can not forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of the system which in some cases tend to relax their efficacy. As connected with this subject provisions to facilitate the taking of bail upon processes out of the courts of the United States and a supplementary definition of offenses against the constitution and laws of the union and of the punishment for such offenses will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary. It would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition to give that satisfaction to foreign nations which we may sometimes have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration of the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations and other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose which takes place if not renewed at the close of the present session.In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dimes the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.The regulation of foreign coins in correspondency with the principles of our national coinage as being essential to their due operation and to order in our money concerns will I doubt not be resumed and completed.It is represented that some provisions in the law which establishes the Post-Office operate in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should this upon due enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy.The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notified to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins–one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans and the circumstances under which they have been made are confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced.Gentlemen of the House of RepresentativesI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec tual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made of the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not will engage your early attention.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of RepresentativesI content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.Various temporary laws will expire during the present session. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit particular notice.The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solid and durable advantages to our constituents; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strengthen and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness.Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivation of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.,Native Americans ID94,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,22,inform,Philadelphia June 1.We are informed that in consequence of instructions from the Executive Council of the United States to the Attorney for the District of Penn sylvania prosecutions have been instituted against John Singleterry and Gideon Henfield charged with violating their duty as Citizens of the United States entering on board the armed schooner Genet in the service of France and with others on board the said schooner capturing several vessels the property of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and otherwise annoying the trade and commerce of the said subjects contrary to the Laws of Nations and the Treaty of Peace subsisting between the United States and his said Britannic Majesty.The above named persons have been committed to the goal of the County of Philadelphia to take their trial at the next Circuit Court of the United States.A letter from Charleston dated May 10 says Yesterday evening a gentleman arrived here from Augusta in Georgia who informs that six of the Creek Towns with a number of Cherokees had declared war against the United States and were actually marching under the command of Bowles and Gilpin at attack the frontiers.,Native Americans ID95,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,07,29,inform,A great number of white people and white families have been killed and scalped by the Indians in the back settlements of America.

They waited on Colonel Trigge of the 12th regiment of foot and some other officers of distinction. One of them who was born in England named Bowles speaks English indifferently well and is extremely communicative. He went over to America with his parents who were in the army when a boy and by some means strayed to an Indian camp where he was most hospitably received and afterwards rais ed to the highest honours of their nation.The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this day to deliver their ??? to Mr. Secretary Grenville.,Native Americans ID316,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,07,inform,MONDAY JAN. 7. By the Fanny Capt. Bryen arrived in twenty four days from New York we have American papers of which we give the following important intelligence:–It is an undoubted truth (Strange as it may appear) that the Baron D'Carondolet Governor of Louisiana and Governor O'Neal of Pensaco la have opened the shores of the King of Spain in West-Florida to the Creeks and Cherokees and delivered them arms and ammunition in abundance advising and stimulating them to go to war against the frontier inhabitants of the United States and that quickly that now or never was the time while the United States were engaged with the northern tribes.On the 30th of September about midnight John Buchanan's station four miles south of Nashville) at which sundry families had collected and fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of Creeks and Lower Cherokees supposed to consist of three of our hundred. Their approach was suspected by the running of cattle that had taken fright at them and upon examination they were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of the gate and from the place and distance they received the first fire from the man who discovered them John M'Rocy. They immediately returned the fire and continued a very heavy and constant firing upon the station blockhouses surrounded with a stockade for an hour and were repulsed with considerable loss without injuring man woman or child in the station.During the whole time of the attack the Indians were never more distant than ten yards from the Block House and often in large numbers close round the lower walls attempting to put fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch where he was shot and falling to the ground renewed his attempts to fire the bottom logs and was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through a port hole of the over???ing which lodged in the roof in the circumference of the bat and those sticking in the walls on the outside are innumerable.Undoubted advices have been received that as early at the 18th of September as many as 500 Creeks passed the Tennessee and the lower Cherokee towns and below as on their way they decared to make war on Cumberland–and that they were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those towns.–This must have been the party that attacked Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was expected but it is now hoped that the check they have received will induce them to return without making further attempts upon that settlement.On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the head of Crooked Creek (a branch of Little River) at which there was a serjeant's command of Cape Crawford's company was attacked by surprise about an hour and a half in the night by a party of Indians commanded by a Cherokee of Will's Town called the Tail a brother of the Bench and Talohteske consisting of 3 other Cherokees and 5 Creeks.James Paul was killed in the knife and George Morse and Robert Sharp at a fire on the outside and John Shankland wounded 3 horses were killed and 7 taken off.These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is due to Mr. Paton their chief instrument to add he has well acted his part!!!We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina) that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire broke out in that town owing to the negligence of a small negro girl which consumed about 40 dwelling houses and stores and 28 buildings of other descriptions.,Native Americans ID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come.

The ineffectual attempts of last summer to prevent the future depredations of the Miamis and some other tribes of Indians and the barbarities before and since committed on the setlers must occasion other people to be very cautious of removing to places where they would hold their lives and property on a very precarious teure unless the arms of the State prove remarkably successful in their future attacks.,Native Americans ID319,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,05,02,inform,Nassau New England March 12.The red bugs which did so much injury to the cotton last year have again made their appearance but not in such numbers as was first expected.The hops in many States of America have been particularly productive.A letter from Great-Ogreechee in Georgia dated December 9th says since the completion of the treaty with the Creeks all has been very quiet unless we except some ill-natured state- bickerings and heart-burning amongst ourselves chiefly occasioned by a few influential men who find themselves great losers by a general act of common justice towards the Indians. These however we expect will subside by degrees; notwithstanding the formidable combination in a certain part of the State.

Afbouring villages without molestation and deftroyed five of them and a quantity of corn computed at fifteen thousand bushels which they found buried in different places and very large quantities of vegetables of every kind. The first opposition that was met with a party of about 150 Kentucky militia and thirty regular troops all under the command of Col. Hardin of Kentucky were detached from the main body lying in the great Miami village to pursue the track of a party of Indians which had the day before been discovered. After a pursuit of about six miles they came up with and were attacked by surprise by a body of Indians who were concealed in the thickets on every side of a large plain; and on the first onset the militia without exchanging a single fire made a most precipitate retreat and left the regular troops to stand the whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was short and bloody; the troops were soon overpowered by numbers and all fell except the two offiers and two or three privates after defending themselves at their bayonet points with the greatest possible obstinacy. Ensign Hartshorn of Franklin was one of the four that escaped and his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat and by that means screening himself from the eye of his pursuers that from any other circumstance. Captain Armstrong who commanded the party likewise made his escape by plunging himself into a pond or swamp up to his neck within two hundred yards of the field of action where he remained the whole night as a spectator of the horrid scene of the War Dance performed over the dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that had fallen the preceding day where their shrieks mixed with the horrid yells of the savages rendered his situation shocking. After this some few skirmishes succeeded but nothing material until the second capital action which happened two days after the army left the Miami village. At ten miles distance from the town the General ordered a halt and detached from four to five hundred militia and about sixty regular soldiers commanded by Major Wylls all under the command of Col. Harden with orders to march back to the town. On their first entrance into the town there appeared a small body of Indians who immediately fled at the first onset and by that means decoyed the whole body of militia by making their flight into different directions and encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means the regular troops were left alone and the Indians had effected their design; for the moment they found the small handful of regular troops detached from the main body of militia they commenced the attack with their whole force excepting the flying parties that had diverted the militia; and although they soon found some part of the militia returning on their back pursued their object of routing and destroying the troops; as the only sure plan of success; which after the bloody conflict on each side they effect. The regular troops all to nine including two commissioned officers were killed and disabled and a total defeat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls of Hartford and Lieut. Frothingham of Middletown. Of the militia it is said about an hundred were killed among whom were a number of brave and valuable characters. The Indians it appears from some cause did not think it prudent to pursue their successes from the field of action for most of the troops that were not killed or sorely wounded made their escape which they never could have done had the Indians pursued with their usual fury.Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the Indians on this occasion; the militia they appeared to despise and with all the undautedness conceivable threw down their guns and rushed upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great number of them fell; but being so far superior in numbers soon overpowered them for while the poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. The defeat of our troops was complete the dead and wounded were left on the field in possession of the savages.No damage of any consequence has been sustained in this part of the country from the Indians; but what effect the expedition may have on us as relates to our frontier it uncertain.– If the Western Indians have any idea of treating for peace we shall be safe; if not we are much exposed.,Native Americans ID324,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,21,inform,Extract of a letter from Norfolk (Virginia) Oct. 26.We learn from the West Country that the Kentucky Convention has determined in favour of a separation and large preparations are making in the country for offensive operations against the Indians who have committed so many murders and harassed the country so much that it can no longer be endured.

Wednesday Dec. 8.The SPEECH of George Washington Esq; President of the Congress on ??? the ???Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIN meeting you again I feel much satisfac tion on being able to repeat my congratulations on the favourable prospects which continue to ditinguish our public affairs. The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our country with plenty and with the means of flourishing commerce. The progress of the public credit is witnessed by a considerable rise of American stock abroad as well as at home; and the revenues allotted for this and other national purposes have been productive beyond the calculation by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof the fertility of our resources but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and credit; and let me add as it bears an honourable testimony to the patriotism and integrity of the marine part of our citizens. The punctuality of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.In conforming to the power vested in me by acts of the last session a loan of 3000000 of florins towards which some provisional measures had previously taken place has been completed in Holland.–As well the exchange with which it has been filled as the nature of the terms (considering the more than ordinary demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) give a reasonable hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and success. The secretary of the treasure has my direction to communicate such further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.Since your last sessions I have received communication by which it appears that the district of Kentucke at present a part of Virginia has concurred in certain propositions contained in a law of that state in consequence of which the district is to become a distinct number of the Union; in case the requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid before you. The liberality and harmony with which it has been conducted will be found to do great honour to both the par ties; and the sentiments of warm attachment of the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow-citizens of Kentucke cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare to the great national impressions under which you will declare on the case submitted to you.It has been heretofore known to Congress that frequent incursions have been made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the north west side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being emboldened by the impunity of their crimes and aided by such parts of the neighbouring tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat for their prisoners and plunder they have instead of listening to the humane invitations and overtures made on the part of the United States renewed their violence with fresh alacrity and greater effect–The lives of a number of valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the western settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the government of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes than it is disposed to respect their rights and rewards their attachments. As this object could not be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the act which empowers the President to call out the militia for the protection of the frontiers; and I have accordingly authorised an expedition in which the regular troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of militia as were sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me The Secretary at War is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it is founded as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.The disturbed situation of Europe and particularly the critical posture of the great maritime powers whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the general peace and security enjoyed by the United States reminds us at the same time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings. It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even of preparations for war among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country to abridge in means and there by enhance the prince of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend it to your serious reflections how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies by such encouragements to ur own navigation as will render our commerce andagriculture less dependant of foreign bottoms which may fail us in the moments most interesting to both of these great objects. Our fisheries and the transportation of our own produce offers us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering the present state of it destresful to us that you will not think any deliberations misemployed which may lead to its relief and protection.The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a judiciary system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider in your wisdom whether improvement of a judicatory system have opened the doors of justice to all descriptions of person. Yu will consider in your wisdom whether im provements in that system may yet be made and particularly whether ??? ???process of execution on sentences issuing from the Federal Courts be not desirable through all the States.The patronage of our commerce of our merchants and seamen has called for the appointment of Consuls in foreign countries. It seems expedient to regulate by law the exercise of that jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted them either by express convention or by a friendly indulgence in the places of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty has stipulated in certain cases the aid of the National authority to his Consuls established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations into full effect.The establishment of the Militia of a Mint of Standards of Weights and Measures of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume of course and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.Gentlemen of the House of Representatives The sufficiency of the revenues you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated leaves no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me moreover to hope that it will be a favourite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the interest of the debt founded but as far and as fast as the growing resources of the country will permit to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation you have made of the western lands explain your dispositions on this subject and I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt the more salutary will the measure be toe very public interest as well as be more satisfactory to our constituents.Gentlemen of the Senate and House of RepresentativesIn perusing the various and weighty business of the present session I indulge the fullest persuasion that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom and animated by the love of your country. In whatever belongs to my duty you shall have all the co-operation which an undiminished zeal for welfare can inspire. It will be happy for us both and our best reward if by a successful administration of our respective trusts we can make the established government more and more instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow citizens and more and more the object of their attachment and confidence.

The Miamis Indians had been for a long time extremely troublesome to the Americans and it was determined to drive them to the back country. General St. Clair completely accomplished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the Indians on the River St. Joseph where a severe battle was fought. Many Indians were killed but the Americans lost the field; several Officers and 150 men were killed and they were not able even to bring off their wounded. This success will in all probability give the Indians new courage and induce them again to make head against the American army.,Native Americans ID329,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,31,inform,Extract of a letter from Boston New England Dec. 11.The demands for the produce of America are most rapidly increasing: one single house has actuallyexported and sold within a very short time 2000 barrels of pot and pear ashes 2000 barrels of beef 500 ditto of pork 70000lb. weight of butter and 1500 bushels of bean and peas.Our news from New York is very disagreeable indeed.

The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and ??? in the river of St. Mary's.Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle.

We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got.

General Wayne has destroyed the most part of the habitation of these Indians in the extent of 200 English miles along the river which is the boundary of Georgia after which he returned to Savannah.

This will be a great acquisition to Britain in every point of view; for though American cannot furnish money she can furnish men and provisions; and afree intercourse with her ports must prove of infinite advantage for the security of our West-India Islands.

A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect.On the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the General immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded.A proclamation was then issued offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken.From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion Capt.

Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces.Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture weresold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded.Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians whoOn this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request.From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility.

A hand-bill just come to Bourbon contains an extract of a letter from Governor St. Clair to General Wilkinson which mentions that our army had met with but little opposition. The Miami villages were abandoned from thence a detachment was sent up to St. Joseph's river which fell in with a party of Indians and had a severe engagement.General Harmar made a shew of retreating and marched about eight miles when he detached a strong party to the field of action in hopes of finding the Indians on the ground; as they expected so they found them and an action immediately commenced which was obstinate on both sides.A vast number of Indians were killed in crossing the St. Joseph's river. Major Fountain of Fayette and General Scott's son were killed the second fire; Capt. M'Murty and 73 militiamen were killed; Major Willis Lieut. Fotheringham of the F–deral troops and 77 privates also fell in the action.General Harmar did not send a single man to reinforce the detachment consisting of 400 men (who had to sustain the fire of the whole Indian army) although he had with him in camp upwards of 1100 men. Our men at last lost ground Colonel Harding's wing was beaten and finally broke. Lieutenant Colonel Hall of Bourbon and Majors M'Million and Willis broke the other wing of the Indians which occasioned the amazing slaughter in the river St. Joseph.General Harmar never sent to bring off the wounded nor bury the dead. Captain David Thrope and Lieut. Clark fell in the field. The Bourbon militia has suffered very much nearly one third of them having fallen on the spot.The army is now at Licking and is expected home hourly.This is the best account that I have been able to collect; it will be delivered to you by Major Jones who before he leaves the district may be enabled to obtain further particulars.,Native Americans ID348,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,02,21,inform,Musquito Shore. Intelligence has been received that in some trivial dispute with a native Indian a Spaniard has stabbed him to the heart with a stiletto and then fled. The nation to whom the Indian belonged being made acquainted with the murder sent a deputation to the Governor demanding that five Spaniards should be instantly delivered up as an attonement. This was peremptorily refused as being more than commensurate to the offence but the murderer was offered as a satisfaction; the Indians would not accept him singly and departed vowing the severest revenge: a few days afterwards intelligence was received that they had surprised and massacred sixteen men who had been at work in the woods; and when the vessel departed the Spaniards were flying with the utmost precipitation and terror from all parts of the country seeking shelter in the forts.,Native Americans ID349,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,07,25,entertain,Norfolk April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion John Simmons master in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind the Albion shipped a sea which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught and belonged to Greenock.Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio to his relation in Winchester Virginia. dated April 13 1791.I wrote to you from Fort Pitt which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats and proceeded to Limestone without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a French station loaded with bacon butter &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4.

They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus with the motto Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man.But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre.To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence.In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness.George-Town. April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known.,Native Americans ID351,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,17,inform,By private letters and newspapers lately arrived from Philadelphia and New York we have informmation that the Indians are carrying on their depredations on the back settlements of the United States with great vigour; that an enquiry as to the miscarriage of the war had been made by Congress and an army was collected this year; that the Americans had some expectations of getting free of the Indian war by treaties.We have advices of Governor Clinton's being re-elected Governor of New York state by a majority of 180 but the friends of Mr. Tay were objecting to the return as the canvassers had not opened the boxes which contained the returns from three counties Otsego Clinton and Tioga which if opened they say would have given the election to Mr. Tay the county of Otsego alone being 300 majority in favours of Mr. Tay.A dreadful storm happened at New York on the 1st of July which continued with so much violence that several vessels were driven from their moorings and a number of boats upset and many lives lost.,Native Americans ID352,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,08,20,inform,Extract of a letter from New York ???A complete overthrow has lately been given to a numerous body of Indians commanded by one of their greatest Warriors who was left dead on the field amongst many hundreds of his followers.The attack was commenced on the morning of the 28th of June by a company of Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Morton of New York aided by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants; and after a contest of three hours put them totally to the rout. The carnage was general amongst the Indians and no quarter given as it might operate as a terror in future to those savage Freebooters whose depredations on the property of every description of individuals and oftentimes ??? with personal cruelty to those in their power has exasperated the Communities to the highest pitch of vengeance and retaliation when an opportunity offered.,Native Americans ID353,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,12,14,inform,Extract of a letter from Philadelphia dated Nov. 1.Advice received from Governor Blount dated the latter end of September informs us that the Cherokees of the five lower towns on the Tenesee headed by John Watts and Esquaka or the bloody fellow has declared war against the United States and that the warriors according to various authentic accounts amount to near 600 including about one hundred banditti Creeks; another letter mentions that the above force had actually set out on some expedition against the frontiers; it is feared they will fall first on Cumberland settlement.,Native Americans ID354,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,10,08,entertain,Extract of a letter from Luxene County. On Saturday the 1st of July I left Tioga point near the middle of the day; about half after one o'clock P. M. a shower appeared to be rising from the north west and I had scarcely time to take shelter in the house of Obadiah Gore Esq; at Sheshequen before the storm came on attended with heavy thunder and lightening and a violent gale of wind with rain. The storm continued up wards of half an hour during which time to see the tumbling of timber during the storm was surprising. After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes. Col. M'Dowell with 300 men pursued them to the Ohio; but not falling in with them he crossed the river leaving 100 men to take care of his horses; after marching about 12 or 15 miles overtook a large party when a severe engagement ensued but being overpowered by numbers was obliged to retreat. He then sent for the men left behind and came up with the Indians the next day and after engaging some time obliged them to make a precipitate retreat. Col. M'Dowell took six Indian warriors two Englishmen and a Frenchman from Detroit and all the negroes and horses.Newtown June 27.On the 13th instant the meeting house in Newtown was removed about eight rods the removal was effected in one hour and an half after previous preparations for the purpose had been made. The house is between 70 and 80 feet long and about 50 feet wide with a steeple at one end; the whole of which was removed entire with the least injury to any part.,Native Americans ID366,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,01,24,inform,Letters from Quebec dated Nov. 17 say that every thing was quiet in that province.Some letters from Quebec were on Saturday received at the General Post Office which state that the American army under the command of General Wayne had been routed by the Otoway Indians; an advanced party of 200 men had been entirely cut off: his army consisted of 400 regulars and 2000 volunteers.,Native Americans ID369,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1793,01,11,inform,As the following Speech of Gen. Washington at the opening of the Congress of the United States at New York Nov. 6 gives an impartial account of the situation of that counttry we are persuaded it will be found not unentertaining to our readers.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives IT is some aba???of the satisfaction with which I meet you on the present occasion that in felicitating you on a continuance of the national prosperity generally I am not able to add to it information that Indian hostilities which have for some time past distressed our western frontier have terminated.You will I am persuaded learn with no less concern than I communicate it that reiterated endeavours towards effecting a pacification have hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs of preserving hostility on the part of the tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop the further effusion of blood–to arrest the progress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of the nation for peace has led to strenuous efforts through various channels to accomplish these desirable puposes:–In making which efforts I consulted less my own anticipations of the events or the scruples which some considerations were calculated to inspire than the wish to find the object attainable; to ascertain unequivocally the such is the case.A detail of the measures which have been pursued and of their consequences which will be laid before you while it will confirm to you the want of success thu s far will I trust evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could have been devised have been employed. The issue of some of them indeed is still depending; but a favourable one though not to be despaired of is not promised by any thing that has yet happened.In the course of the attempts which have been made some valuable citizens have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly respected even among savages has been found in this instance insufficient to protect from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will I presume be duly considered whether the occasiondoes not call for an exercise of liberality towards the families of the deceased.It must add to your concern to be informed what besides the continuation of hostile appearances among the tribes north of the Ohio some threatening symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.A part of the Cherokees known by the name of Chickamagas inhabiting five villages on the ??? river have long been in the practice of committing depredations on the neighbouring settlements.It was hoped that the treat of Holston made with the Cherokee nation in July 1791 would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas aided by some banditti of another tribe in their vicinity have recently perpetrated wanton and unproved hostilities upon the citizens of the United States in that quarter.I have reason to believe that every predictable exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative of a prosecution of the war in the event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised have been recruited though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed. A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing towards a pacific termintion of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the number of troops raised and some other points which have been suggested will afford more precise information as a guide to the legislative consultations and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional stimulus to the recruiting service may not be advisable.In looking forward to the future expence of the operations which may be found inevitable I derive consolation from the information I receive that the product of the revenues for the present year is likely to supersede the necessity of additional burthens on the community for the service of the ensuing year. This however will be better ascertained in the course of the session; and it is proper to add that the information alluded to proceeds from the supposition of no material extention of the spirit of hostilities.I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy to the laws throughout our interior frontier; and for restraining the commission of outrages upon the Indians; without which all ??? plans must prove nugatory. To enable by ???ent rewards the employment of qualified ??? persons to reside among them as agents would also contribute to the preservation of peace and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these expedients an eligible plan could be devised for promoing civilization among the friendly tribes and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale equal to their wants and under regulation calction its influence in cementing their interest with ours could not but be considerable.The prosperous state of our revenue had been intimated–This would be still more the case were it not for the impediments which in some places continue to embarrass the collection of ???duties on spirits distilled within the United States.These impediments have lessened and are ?ess???din local extent; and as applied to the community at large the contentment with the law app??? to be progressive.But symptoms of increased opposition have lately manifested themselves in certain quarters; I judged special interposition on my part proper and adviseable and under this impression have issued a proclamation warning against all unlawful combinations and proceedings having for this object or tending to obstruct the operation of the law in question and announcing that all lawful ways and means would be strictly put in excution for bring to justice the infractors thereof and securing obedience thereto.Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders. And Congress may be assured that nothing within constitutional and legal limits which may depend on me shall be wanting ???sert and maintain the just authority of the law. In fulfilling this trust I shall count entirely upon the full co-operation of the other departments of the government and upon the zealous support of all good citizens.I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the legislature the subject of a revision of the judiciary system. A representation from the judges of the supreme court which will be laid before you points out some of the inconveniences that are being experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws considerations rise out of the structure of that system which some cases ???to relax their efficacy. As connected with the subject provisions to facilitate the raking of ??? upon processes out of the Courts of the United States and supplementary definition of offence against the constitution and laws of the union ??? of the punishment for such offences will it is presumed be found worthy of particular attention.Observations on the value of peace with other nations are unnecessary; I would be wise however by timely provisions to guard against those acts of our own citizens which might tend to disturb it and to put ourselves in a condition ??? give that satisfaction to foreign nations which ???may sometimes have occasion to require from them.I particularly recommend to your considerations the means of preventing those aggressions by our citizens on the territory of other nations as other infractions of the law of nations which furnishes just subject of complaint might endanger our own peace with them. And in general the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented to your attention ??? expiration of the law for that purpose which taken place if not re??? at the close of the present session.In execution of the authority given by the legislature measures have been taken for engagement of our mint–others have been employed at at home. Provision has been made of the requisite buildings and therefore now putting into proper condition for the purpose of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half-dollars; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them.The regulation of some provision in the law which establishes the Post Office open to in experiment against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts of the country.–Should that upon the enquiry be found to be the fact a full conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence and information will I doubt not lead to the application of a remedy.The adoption of a constitution for the state of Kentucky has been notfied to me. The legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the nation to which it relates and conducive to the general order.It is proper likewise to inform you that since my last communication on the subject and in further execution of the acts severally making provision for the public debt and for the reduction thereof three new loans have been effected each for three millions of florins—one at Antwerp at the annual interest of four and one-half per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in lieu of all charages.–The rates of these loans and the circumstance under which they have been made ar confirmations of the high state of our credit abroad.Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied the payment of the debts due to certain foreign officers according to the provision made during the last session has been embraced.Gentlemen of the House of RepresentativesI entertain a strong hope that the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you to enter upon a systematic and effecttual arrangement for the regular redemption and discharge of the public debt according to the right which has been reserved to the government –no measure can be more desirable whether viewed with an eye to its intrinsic importance or to the general sentiment and wish of the nation.Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has been made for the Bank of the United States pursuant to the section of the act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations in this particular it is expected a valuable saving will be made.Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year and for such extraordinaries as may require provision will demand and I doubt not engage your early attention.Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives I content myself with recalling your attention generally to such objects not particularized in my present as have been suggested in my former communications to you.Various temporary laws will expire during the present sesssion. Among these that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes will merit your particular notice.The results of your common deliberations hitherto will I trust be productive of solide and durable advantages to our constituentes; such as by conciliating more and more their ultimate suffrage will tend to strength and confirm their attachment upon which under Divine Providence materially depend their union their safety and their happiness.Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends there is nothing which can have a more powerful tendency than the careful cultivatino of harmony combined with a due regard to stability in the public councils.G. WASHINGTON.,Native Americans ID370,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,09,17,inform,EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS.New York July 5.This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed last Sabbath about four o'clock M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado which continued about 20 minutes twisting off limbs of trees unroofing houses and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city. Unused to such unruly gusts the citizens particularly the fair were thrown into a momentary d???ation. Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment in the twinkling of an eye were they hurried to the bottom and melancholy was the scene. It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty. Report says that a Mr. Wade his wife and two of their children his brother and a young man were all except the last mentioned drowned from one boat near Yellow Hook a few miles from the city. It is also said a sloop overset with 16 persons all but one of whom were drowned.We learn that the ??? extended to Philadelphia that ship was driven from her moorings there and sunk and that the road from thence to this city shrewn violent tokens of its visitation.July 14.The society for promoting the manufacture of maple sugar met at Albany July 3 have granted 75 dollars bounty to Thaddeus Scribner of Herkermer county for having produced 600 lb. of grained maple sugar of superior quality– of 50 dollars to Comfort Cook of Otsego for producing sugar of equal quality but a less quantity –and of 25 dollars to J. Harris and R. Huntley of Saratoga county for the third rate quantity. The society resolved to exhibit samples from each of these parcels to the legislature at their text session in order to induce them to give larger bounties for the further encouragement of this important manufacture.Aug. 4.On Saturday last arrived in this city directly from Scotland.–Nesbit Esq. a gentleman who comes warmly recommended by the celebrated Dr. Robinson and several other literary characters of eminence in that country as a master of the science of canaling from several years experience both in Holland and in Scotland.The President of the Northern Inland L. ?.

The Indigo plantations when the last vessels sailed were almost despaired of for the next crop and the rice swamps promised not much better.July 18.We are sorry to learn from New York that spirit of party respecting a late election of Governor of the State has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week. On Thursday morning last Colonel W??? and Mr. Wilcocks both of New York had a meeting and exchanged pistol shot but their friends in ??? prevented any bad consequences.–Colonel Willet is friendly to Governor Clinton's election which Mr. Wilcock opposes.We hear from Maryland that a number of gentlmen of the state are about establishing a society in Port-To??? for the dissemination of useful political knowledge the study of the constitution of their country and the keeping up among the people if possible a knowledge of their rights as free citizens of the greatest and perhaps the only true republic in the universe.August 6.On Thursday morning was witnessed a very melancholy event at Mr. Henry Kizer's power mill in lower Merion township Montgomery country between the hours of 9 and 10. There was a large quantity of powder in the mill which by accident took fire and blew up with a great explosion which was heard at Schuylkill ferry and was there supposed to be an earthquake. Mr Kizer and three others who were in the mill were blown to pieces; and a Mr. Henry Fraily a copartner of Mr. Kizer was so wounded that his life is dispared of. A young woman who happened to be near the mill at the time it blew up had both her legs broken and was otherwise very much injured by one of the rafters which was carried from the building in the violence of the explosion.Petersburgh July 10.We learn from North Carolina that a fire broke out in the town of Washington on Wednesday the 27th ult. which burn nearly half the town.–The loss in houses goods &c. is said to be very considerable.???sburgh July 21.Extract of a letter from Captain Paul of the State Levies dated Middle Block house of the frontiers of Washington country July 16 1792.The Indians on Tuesday last killed two men and one woman and stole seven horses between the states of Crays Creek and Col.

They had been met at Niagara by Indian commissioners and with them had sailed in separate vessels to the mouth of Detroit river 18 miles from Detroit where our commissioners were directed to remain until an asswer should be brought from the great council of Indian nations assembled at the rapids of the Miami and the Lake. On the 2d of August an answer was brought to this effect that the only terms onw hich peace could be made was our ceding the country on the west of the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The commissioners suggested the impossibilities of doing this as the lands had been sold by the Congress and people had settled on them but that the United States would be willing to give more goods than they had given at any other time. The Indians replied that if the Congress would give one half these goods to the people that had settled the would leave the land and remove the difficulty. Our commissioners replied that the land they must have and would not give it up. The Indians said it was well and there need no more be said. However desired them to remain if they thought proper until they returned to the council and laid this before them. On the 16th of August two Indians came and informed that the final result of their deliberations was the country in question or war. The express is of opinion from the language of individual Indians in private and from other circumstances that the British wholly conduct their council and dictate their demands.By the arrival of some person from Fort Washington on Monday last we are informed that the Indians still contiue hovering about our garrisons and occasionally stealing horses that the army is in high spirits anxiously waiting the event of the treaty and hoping that a campaign will take place as no idea of peace is entertained by any one; that the greatest pains has been taken by the commander in chief in training his men in the act wood fighting and that from their proficiency and the ???imity prevailing throughout the whole army success may be expected should a campaign take place.New York Sept. 17.A Mr. Spier was removed from his lodgings in this city on Sunday last to Governors Island where he died this morning. He arrived from Philadelphia last Thursday was seized with Fever on Friday.–The Doctors pronounced it the malignant putrid fever and the event proved their opinion to be just.According to a list published of the births and deaths in the several religious societies of Philadelphia it appears that from August 1 1792 to August 1 1793 the Births amounted to 2511 and the Death to 1467.Philadelphia Sept. 21.The stages for New-York returned to this city with all the passengers (mortified and fatigued.) One of the drivers had a very narrow escape with his life being cruelly fired upon at Trenton; the ball passing within a few inches of his head! The ladies &. have been without any refreshment on the road as the panic and terror with which every mind is possessed by the writings and measures above alluded to prevented their obtaining any accommodations on the road–O tell it not in Gath! declare it not in the streets of Askelon! Ye New Yorkers and ye Baltimorians you have been generous to strangers; but forgot the charitable and fraternal attention due to your own fellow-citizens!Sept. 25.Extract of a letter from a gentleman who lately left his city on his way to the southward.We were stopped about seven miles from Baltimore by armed men who used us with every indignity and hatred truly indicative of malice prepense. These detained us in the stage from five to the afternoon until ten the ensuing morning; during this interval one of these ruffians who appeared to be a German snapped his piece at one of this party who seemed inclined to leave the stage with an apparent design to go among the bushes nears the road; this guard in their tender mercy wre pleased to hand us a piece of dry cheese on the end of a pitch-fork. After this quarantine we were permitted to go to Gray's Garden and there to perform another for the space of two days and nights.New-York Sept. 28.Extract of a letter from Philadelphia to a gentleman in Baltimore dated the 20th instant.You request I would endeavour to give you a particular account of the state of the city in general and the rise and progress of the malignant fever now raging here.I believe it will be difficult precisely to determine its origin; but it is generally admitted to have been imported from Cape-Francois in a vessel which came to a wharf betwen Arch and Race-street beause the infection broke out ina house connected with that vessel and it was afterwards traced to that vessel. The disorder overtook several families thereabouts. But most people apprehended it to be the general fall-fever which acted severly on those who had the influenza–To that there was no material danger apprehended until the death of Peter Ashton in Vine-street who after a short illness died about one month past; after which the disorder was clearly discovered to be the putrid or yellow fever and each person became after of his neighbours insomuch that if any became sick they were avoided and many fled from the sick leaving them in a destitute situation perhaps shut up in a house and the neighbours alarmed merchants and housekeepers moved into the country and fear was stamped on every countenance–infirmness possessed the hearts of the people–little business was done except packing up–engaging waggons to move goods into the country and searching for shelter for their families; many families set off without having a particular place to go to. Thus the country became alarmed. Individuals died in the country–but I cannot learn ?hat it spread there.The overseers duty became exceedingly heavy and several of them were taken sick; others abandoned their post and the business bore very hard on the remaining few. Finding deaths increasingly abundantly they procured carpenters to make coarse coffins by the do???. The malady still increasing in Water Front Race and Vine-street threatened desolation in those quarters. The overseers moved by the distresses of the helpless took possession of Bush-Hill mansion (it being empty) and erected a hospital employed some physicians and nurses; sent out some accomadations and provided for interring the dead.The overseers became inadequate to the business by reason fo fear; few in number and the funds exhausted; added to this the extravagant wages of the nurses two and three dollars per day most of the magistrates fled; the house of employment and hospital shut their doors against all indigent and indisposed persons. Thus were the people who had been private patientes on the poor list abandoned and had no sheltering place and those who were slightly indisposed were sent to Bush-Hill and became victims with many others.The inhabitants were requested to meet by public advertisement and a committee of 40 was appointed to take charge of the Bush-Hill hospital and to relieve the distressed in the city and its vicinity they became organized Ianto693 negociated a loan in the bank two of the number voluntarily offered their service to see the business of Bush-Hill properly conducted; bedsteads were procured the house cleaned matrons appointed and nurses under their direction; an apothecary with medicine &c. and four physicians to attend once a day.The remainder of the committee attend at the State House receive information from the committee at Bush-Hill and supply their demands; receive all sheets shirts &c. &c. at the State-House also keep a supply of ready made coffins to furnish as occasion required. Several carts are procured for the various purposes of carrying out the sick whom the doctors pronounce to have the fever of disposing the corpsand for carrying provisions and other necessaries to and from the hospital. THere is also a house fitted up and under the care of a matron to be for the use of those children whose parents have died with the fever; as all their relations and neighbours are shy of them; the governor has directed the State Treasury to be open for their use and they to be accountable to him for their expenditures.–The city seems quite solitary and business at a stand; deaths numerous and no parade at the interment of any; the bells do not ring nor is there any invitations to the funeral of any. I think about 1000 have died since the disorder first made its appearance but it cannot be ascertained with precision; and we think between 15 and 20000 removed from their habitations.The doctors suppose the disorder a little checked by the cool weather; how that is I know now.By a passenger arrived from Albany this morning we learn that in order to prevent the introduction of the Yellow Fever in Albany they have formed Committees and fixed a Gun-Boat at some distance from the city where all vessels are stopt till the Doctors examine the passengers–And that Colonel Hamilton and Lady were arrived but were denied admittance into the city and had taken lodgings at a Mr. M'Gown's at Green-Bush.October 2.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadelphia to the Printers of this PAper dated September 28.The papers must have amply informed you of the melancholy situation of this city for five or six weeks past. Grave digging has been the only business carrying on; and ndeed I may say of late Pit digging where people are interred indiscriminately in three tiers of coffins. From the most accurate observations I can make upon matters I think I speak within bounds when I Say eighteen hundred persons have perished (I do not say all of the yellow fever) since its first appearance on the 3d of August in North Water-street; others think a larger number–but I confess we are a good deal in the dark on the subject at present and it will take some time to have accurate returns made.People have been hitherto so panic struck that little has been attnded to but the means of self-preservation; gloom and melancholy is on every persons countenance; nothing but the yellow fever is talked of; the street are often seen without a passenger; the wharfs are deserted the markets miserable and uncommonly high and nearly one half the citizens departed. The city is truly republican; pomp and distinction have in a great measure disadpeared and bad Plato himself come among us to preach up the practice of true republicansim his lectures could not have had a greater effect upon the minds of men than the present mortality.We make use of no other precaution for avoiding the contagion than not going into infected houses–keeping our own well aired clean and frequently having the walls white-washed. considering the general terro I have more than once felt my pulse to discover whether I was really alive or not; however I now begin to hoep we may escape as cool weather is fast approaching and one-street in general healthy.Of all things this yellow fever is the most insidious–its approaches are generally gradual–a person imagines himself well when he is dying–other loss the use of reason entirely and die in that situations. with those few that recover its effects are long left. It acts like a steeltrap–when once it gets hold of a person it does not easily let him get off.Philadelphia Oct. 7.Died of Sunday the 29th ult. Samuel Powell Esq. Speaker of the Senate of this commonwealth a gentleman of a benevolent disposition an improved mind a sound understanding and an honest heart.Died on Friday evening after a short illness with the present maligant fever at Mrs. Grant's–Mr Chase a yong gentleman of respectable connections of Baltimore.Winchester Sept. 20.Extract of a letter from our correspondent at ??? Creek Territory South of the Ohio dated Sept. 4.Times here were but a gloomy aspect. The ???le daily harassed by the Indians. On the 27th of August a party consisting of about 300 killed Lieut. Janks Tedford of the United States troops and a Mr. JAckson as they were gathering corn in a field for their horses near Henry's stations–They have lately burnt many houses on the Nine Mile and destroyed a prodigious quantity of wheat rye and corn. WE hope Governor Blount on his return to this territory will be invested with power to desstroy these barbarous tribes.From the same dated Sept. 14.On the 30th of August some Indians killed one young woman and scalped another in Washington county; and on the 5th instant a part of them wounded four persons and scalped one about nine miles from Green Court-House; a house was also attacked by them but they were forced to retreat by the owner thereof and one of his daughters who fired several rounds and wounded some of them. On the 16th another party of the savages killed a woman and child on Nine-Mile.New-York Oct. 16.Monday evening last a number of persons assembled in the fields when they commenced the demolition of Mother Cay's house which in a short time was intirely resed to the ground floor; the furniture beds clothing &c. were all destroyed. another house of ill fame tenanted by Mother Giles under went a similar fate. It is aid that three persons were wounded one dangerously from the firing of small arms by some persons who were placed in the house for its defence.–We lament that our worthy Mayor received some injury in endeavouring to disperse the people.,Native Americans
