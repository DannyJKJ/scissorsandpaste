Just as we arrived there was a famine and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead but burn them to ashes if they can afford it; if not throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed it carried him off. If a man woman or child dies at night the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it that I took no notice of it.I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission and many souls perished. Now consider first an inundation; second a famine; and third a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last and arrived at Calcutta after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days) hearty and well thank God.,fire ID123,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,19,inform,Extract of a letter from the agent to at the Cape of Good Hope dated 15th Nov. 1817: –The following most daring instance of piracy was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. viz.– The Elizabeth White lying at anchor off Robin Island with about 120 tons of oil on board was boarded at about one a. m. by a party of armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regiment and convicts about 12 in number i. e. five soldiers and seven convicts who after securing the hatches &c. obtained possession of the ship and in the same instant cut the cables loosed the sails and favoured by a strong S. E. wind succeeded in carrying her off at six a.m. The captain and crew having refused to listen to their invitation to join them in their piratical undertaking with the exception of the mate were permitted to leave the ship in the boat which reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock the same day.By a letter received to-day we learn that the Admiral Gambier Brash laden with Government stores for Ceylon was totally lost on the morning of the 20th of June last having struck on the reef Roan de Nova in the Mozambique Channel ; crew saved.A letter from Halifax dated the 27th Nonember says – Colonel Bouchette Surveyor- General of Lower Canada with Captain Campbell of the 60th regiment and Mr Bouchette jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes.Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard–On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock- yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11,fire ID244,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,09,24,inform,The St Nicholas Morgan which has arrived off Aberdeen from Bathurst New South Wales reports that timber was very scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that 250 tons of cut timber had been burnt and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.,fire ID349,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,07,25,entertain,Norfolk April 11. This day arrived the ship Albion John Simmons master in 47 days from Rotterdam; on the 8th lying to in a heavy gale of wind the Albion shipped a sea which carried away all her boats and every loose article from the deck; there were three men of the watch one of whom is washed overboard and perished– his name is John M'Naught and belonged to Greenock.Extract of a letter from a gentleman at the falls of the Ohio to his relation in Winchester Virginia. dated April 13 1791.I wrote to you from Fort Pitt which place we left the 3d. inst. in company with two other boats and proceeded to Limestone without meeting or apprehending danger–at that place we were informed of several disasters which had befallen boats going down the river and one to a boat going up to a French station loaded with bacon butter &c. The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4. It is supposed that the adventures of the town of Boston lost 25000 dollars in the late lottery; besides 'wear and tear' of conscience.Salem May 31.

They had likewife hold laced hats; with silk bandeaus with the motto Long live the President. An immense number of people assembled near the Quay and on board the vessels in the river which as well as works saluted him with several discharges of artillery. The day was afterwards devoted to conviviality–The lodge of St. John addressed his Excellency as follows:–Right Worshipful Sir We the Master Officers and Members of St. John's Lodge No. 2 of Newbern beg leave to hail you welcome with three times three! We approach you not with the language works have proved you to be the true and faithful Brother the skilful and expert Craftsmen the just and upright Man.But the powers of eloquence are too feeble to express with sufficient energy the cordial warmth with which our bosoms glow towards you–We therefore most frevently wish–more ardently and devoutly pray that the Providence of the Most High may strengthen establish and protect you in your walk through life–and when you are called off from your terrestrial labours by command of our divine grand master and your operations sealed with the mark of his approbation may your soul be everlastingly refreshed with the streams of living water which flow from the right hand of God. And when the Supreme Architect of all world's shall collect his most precious jewels as ornaments of the Celestial Jerusalem–may you eternally shine among those of the brightest lustre.To which the President returned the following answer:– Gentlemen I receive the cordial welcome which you are pleased to give me with sincere gratitude. My best ambition having aimed at the unbiassed approbation of my fellow citizens it is peculiarly pleasing to find my conduct so affectionately approved by a fraternity whose association is founded on justice and benevolence.In reciprocating the kind wishes contained in your address be persuaded that I offer a sincere prayer for your present and future happiness.George-Town. April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut. Jeffers at Fort Franklin mentions that an Indian had arrived there who brought him intelligence that 300 warriors of the Chippawa and other nations had set out for war and that they were determined to strike on the Allegheny or Ohio near Petersburgh; that 1000 men were preparing but their destination was not known.,fire ID370,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,09,17,inform,EXTRACTS FROM LATE NEWSPAPERS.New York July 5.This city and its vicinity were exceedingly alarmed last Sabbath about four o'clock M. P. by a tremendous westerly tornado which continued about 20 minutes twisting off limbs of trees unroofing houses and tumbling down chimneys in various parts of the city.

Terrible was the havoc on the water–in vain did the Sabbath breakers cry for mercy–in a moment in the twinkling of an eye were they hurried to the bottom and melancholy was the scene. It is said that 29 persons lost their lives in this neighbourhood but we have not been able to ascertain who they were for certainty.

The Indigo plantations when the last vessels sailed were almost despaired of for the next crop and the rice swamps promised not much better.July 18.We are sorry to learn from New York that spirit of party respecting a late election of Governor of the State has arisen to such a height as to have occasioned several duels a week.
