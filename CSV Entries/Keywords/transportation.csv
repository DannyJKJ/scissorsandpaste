These unhappy wretches are almost destitute of every sort of covering and some of them are labouring under sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurateas follows: About the middle of last June this miserable class of beings to the amount of 102 men and boys and twelve women all of whom were convicts were embarked at Dublin on board the Duke of Leinster transport the owners of which who are Dublin merchants contracted with the Government of Ireland for carrying the convicts to the North American States.After the ship had been at sea five weeks part of which was foul weather the provision is said to have fallen short ; the master of the transport Capt. Harrison accordingly stood in for Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he disembarked at Bull's Bay and a little distance from it with as much secrecy as possible his desperate freight.To prevent this proceeding being too early early known he landed with them provision for the immediate supply of their wants and bore away with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived for three days in a state of warfare quarrelling about their food ; the strongest beat the weak and over a cask of rank butter or beef there was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom had been at stake.They reached the town of St. John's on the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appaling procession ever seen in that country : the inhabitants had immediate councils; and the military and navy co-operating a place of security was fixed upon at a distance from the town and they were lodged ; here under a guard.Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full chorus and the centinels were frequently frighted with the noise while on their posts. A battle or two every half hour kept them festive all day; and when the provision supplied to them by the inhabitants was lessening they broke away and laid hold of every thing that was eatable without enquiring whether it had an owner.Some of these poor wretches were anxious to be received into the service of the inhabitants and probably might have reformed if so fostered. But all of them have a claim to the charity of this country for that supply of raiment which is necessary to guard them against the inclement weather.,transportation ID100,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,02,14,inform,At four o'clock yesterday morning Mess. Muir Skirving and Margarot were taken from their beds without any previous notice hand-cuffed and put into a post-chaise to be conveyed to Woolwich where a vessel waits to sail with them immediately for Botany Bay.Mr. Palmer has we understood been sent from on board the hulks in the same manner to take his passage on board the same vessel.Between 10 and 11 o'clock about sixty female convicts were put on board a vessel at Blackfriars bridge destined to the same voyage. These latter behaved in a most turbulent manner and even fought in the hold of the boat. There were among them one or two well dressed women ; and what was more lamentable in the eyes of the spectator some of had infants with them.,transportation ID112,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1814,05,26,inform,New South Wales IntelligenceA proclamation issued by Governor Macquarrie appears in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May stating that Peter Mills Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple Van Dieman's Land and George Williams Acting Deputy Commissary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement had absconded from their habitations and fled to the woods ; that their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which they had armed themselves and taken the command of a gang of 26 desperadoes with whose aid they had committed numerous robberies–entering the lands of settlers driving away their cattle and plundering their houses.

The good understanding between the natives and our settlers which had been maintained for the last six years has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal consequences. On Saturday a body of 60 natives commenced plundering the fields of a settler when three privates of the veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The narushed upon them before they could load again and killed on private Isaac Eustace and compelled the other two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs Milehouse and Butcher.

The only information I can yet give you is that the exploring survey has been extended from the source of the St Croix river to the river Restigouche in line about 100 miles ; in this short distance both parties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the severest nature. The Americans employed on the same line with our English Commissioners are represented as men of great ability and acting with that spirit of liberality that infuses confidence on each side rendering their arduous task less severe and gloomy than was to have been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this quarter. Our trade continues dull and money scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent advance but expected to be lower in consequence of the Commissary-General having refused to take the provincial notes.Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard–On Friday night about half-past nine o'clock this place was thrown into the greatest consternation by the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard the beating of drums and the firing of the men of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire having broken out in the house belonging to the steam engine erected for carrying on the new works situated in the southern part of the dock- yard near the kilns used for burning cement stone. The most serious apprehensions were entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and what was more distressing to the feelings of the spectators was its coniguity to the workhouse which from the pressure of the times and want of employment is crowded with many unfortunate individuals. Providence however averted the impending danger and about twelve o'clock we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames subdued with only the loss of the engine-house. No lives it is understood have been lost but one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker of the Northumberland and the officers of that ship Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter and Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary with the military officers and soldiers of the garrison assembled on the first alarm. The latter were under arms the whole time and were of great service in keeping off the spectators. The inhabitants of the twon were at one time under serious apprehensions as the fire was not far from the Fountain tavern and the residence of Mr Miller in High Street. At the former the landlady of the house had but recently lain in and was removed on the first alarm being given. Sir Robert Barlow from Chatham who superintends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle was here yesterday to investiage into the cause which it is suspected arose from carlessness – The damage however has not been so great as was at first expected and which it might have been but for the prompt and effectual assistance that was given – Sheerness January 11,transportation
