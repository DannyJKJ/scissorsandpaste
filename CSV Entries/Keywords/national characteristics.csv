ID13,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,28,inform,Extract of a letter form Philadelphia dated 25th May 1789.I have travelled through several of the States and see no appearance of the poverty which you hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. All the manufactured goods imported from Europe are from Britain and they cannot have goods equal in quality and price from any other place.I think I never say so many children as are in this country every town village and farm-house are full of them.–The people of this country increase like rabbits: It is supposed they double their numbers every fifteen years; but I should think they do it in a shorter period.–What a grand prospect for the sale of British goods for when so many hundreds of millions of acres of land lye [sic] idle to be granted or purchased at a small price the people of this country never will manufacture ; At present wages are high and 1000 acres of land in the back settlements may be purchased for as many [pence?].ID90,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,23,inform,CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.The following account of the inhabitants of this settlement is given by a late traveller.The education of youth has hitherto been very much neglected: the government never hit upon any successful plan for the establishment of public schools; and the individual had no other ambition but that of qualifying his sons by writing and accounts to become servants of the Company. This body of merchants had a number of persons in their employ who were very ill paid. Their salaries indeed were sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the consequence of such a conduct was that each became a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little private shop in some corner of his house. The most paltry articles were in the list of their commodities for sale ; and those who ranked high in government and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to their names felt no sore of indignity in retailing the produce of their gardens ; not indeed avowedly but through the medium of their slaves. In fact the minds of every class the Governor the Clergy the F[?]l and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted were wholly bent on trade. Knopman or merchant was a title that conferred rank at the Cape to which the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chinese who have degraded the merchant into the very lowest order of their society.That portion of the day not employed in the concerns of trade is usually devoted to the gratification of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste for reading and none for the cultivation of the fine arts.–They have no kind of public amusements except occasional balls ; nor is there much social intercourse but by family parties; which usually consist of card playing or dancing. Money-matters and merchandize engross their whole conversation : yet none are opulent though many in easy circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole colony and but a few who are objects of public cha rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the interest of a fund established out of the church superfluities from alms donations and collections made after divine service and not from any tax laid upon the public. Except indeed a few colonial assessments for the repairs of the streets and public works the inhabitants of the Cape have little drawback on their profits on the produce of their labour.It has been the remark of most travellers that the ladies of the Cape are pretty lively and good humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic temper which is a principal trait in the national character of the Dutch. The difference in the manners and appearance of the young men and the young women in the same family is inconceivably great. The former are clumsy in their shape awkward in in their carriage and of an unsocial disposition; whilst the latter are generally of a small delicate form below the middle size of easy and unaffected manners well dressed and fond of social intercourse; an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained by their parents and which they as seldom turn to abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on and less subject to the caprice of parents than else where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; but all the children male and female share alike in the family property. No parent can disinherit a child without assigning on proof on at least of the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian Code.By the law of the colony a community of all property both real and personal is supposed to take place on the marriage of two person unless the contrary should be particularly provided against by solemn contract made before marriage. Where no such contract exists the children on the death of either parent are entitled to that half of the joint property which was supposed to belong to the deceased and which cannot be withheld on application after they are come of age.It is but justice to the young females of the Cape to r emark that many of them have profited much more than could be expected from the limited means of education that the place affords. In the better families most of them are taught music and some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. Many understand the French language and some have made great proficiency in the English. They are expert at the needle and all kinds of lace knotting and tambour work and in general make up their own dresses following the prevailing fashion of England brought from time to time by the female passengers bound to India from whom they may be said to Catch the manners living as they riseNeither are the other sex while boys deficient in vivacity or talent ; but for want of the means of a proper education to open their minds and excite in them a desire of knowledge they soon degenerate into the common routine of eating smoaking [sic] and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate with the English except such as hold employments under the Government. This backwardness may be said to be owing in part to the different habits of the two nations and partly perhaps to the reluctance that a vanquished people must always feel in mixing with their conquerors.ID141,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Extract of a letter from William Hunt esq. To H. Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times betterID317,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1792,04,27,inform,Richmond January 28. Extract of a letter from a Gentleman now residing at Quebec to his Correspondent in this City dated Jan. 9 1972Our humanity was deeply affected by the dreadful carnage made by the Indians. You may be assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 1000 and that nothing saved General St. Clair and the remainder of his army but the great quantity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were composed of various tribes and three-fourths of of them remained in the camp to plunder it and to take scalps the trophies of their victory; and he that got most when he returned to his nation acquired the greatest share of glory; hence only about 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is under 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they have obtained at so easy a purchase and the riches they obtained by the plunder and the provisions they found will make them a more terrible foe than ever they have been; they boast of taking an amazing quantity of powder and arms which they wanted; many of them were only armed with spears and hatchets and I have no doubt but if another expedition should be set on foot that they will be met by three times the number of Indians. The indian tribes of nations who live many hundred miles back have all entered into an association and made the present war a common concern they to oppose what they call the common enemy. The warriors of the different tribes so united are not less than 15 or 20000; numbers of the chiefs of ten or twelve numerous nations were here last summer. Lord Dorchester advised them to make peace and offered his mediations; he told them he was at peace with the United States and could give them no assistance. Their answer was that the enemy was in their country and would not make peace with them but on term dishonourable and at the expense of their country and that they had determined to die before they would accept of such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the answer they received and departed with a full determination to defend their country with the last of their blood.You may depend on it that many years will elapse and many thousand men be expended before the United States will by the present measures be able to possess the country in contest; and I may also add that I have great apprehensions that desolation and destruction will be the consequence on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next spring; I would to God some steps might be taken to prevent them. I have no doubt the country might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the expence already incurred by the different expeditions; the attempt to take the country from them by force is founded in unrighteousness and ought to be abandoned; besides if the American mean to have anytrade with them they are taking steps that will prevent it for many years to come. The Indians do not easily forget or forgive injuriesCarlisle Jan. 4. 1792.By the Pittsburgh post which arrived yesterday we are informed that previous to his leaving Pittsburgh an express had arrived there with the melancholy news that Forts Jefferson and Franklin were taken by Indians and that two large bodies of them were moving to the Allighany.Extract of a Letter from Patowmack North Amer ca Feb. 7.Last Sunday evening came to this town a young man from Cat-fish which he left about two weeks ago and who gave us the following pleasing interesting and important intelligence viz that two days before he left Cat-fish two men arrived there from Licking who informed that they had been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horseback from Kentucky under General Scott; that they left Licking on the expedition a few days before Christmas; that General Scott dispatched three spies in advance who when they arrived about 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the plunder they had taken riding the bullocks dancing &c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that on the information being given to General Scott who with the main body were a few miles in the rear he divided them into three divisions advanced and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the contest was short but victorious on the side of the volunteers 700 of the enemy being killed on the spot all the cannon and stores in their possession retaken and the remainder of that savage body put to flight; that General Scott having lost but six men returned to Licking in triumph with most of the cattle stores &c. leaving the cannon at Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previously gone out with 400 men but finding his number was insufficient was returning but met a body of 900 volunteers when upon joining him he immediately proceeded in prosecution of his original design which fortunately proved successful.Our informant further adds that he saw a Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January at Morgan Town brought by Major Scott's expedition which corresponded with that given by the two men at Cat Fish and that Gen. Scott brought in near 700 scalps.ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.–There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million inproduce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar.Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits.I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke.There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand–25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.–Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.
