M. happened the most violent hurricane pest or thunder storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing but an earthquake that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west or rather a number of clouds of a lowering aspect furiously agitated broken and seemingly ready to fall– attracted the attention and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening appeared to those who were at a distance remarkably red and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again in quick succession or some time as to appear one sheet of flame. This might have had a great effect on the air at some miles distance from town to set it in rapid motion especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a most impetuous wind darkened the air in such a manner that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins with such irresistible force did the column of air move on: happily however the damages were much less than apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson being an an elevated spot near the west end of the town and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column was the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off and a great part of the roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house which stood at a small distance on the east striking it forcibly and injuring it greatly in its ways and fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward the next elevated object to which it pointed its fury was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a building of uncommon solidity calculated it was thought to stand for ages admist all the war of the elements. About a fourth part however of the roof of the north side was carried off with the weighty cornice and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings and greatly injured that range nearest the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood which were in the line of its direction were also thrown down; but how far it extended or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it however not be forgotten that dreadful as the scene was through the good providence of God not a single life was lost or any personal injury worth mentioning received and the buildings it is hoped will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before.,weather ID24,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,New York Aug. 20.The weather last week in this city and suburbs continued to be extremely hot until Sunday midnight after a thunder squall. The change which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy.Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week; and it is said that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water Raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before suddenly fell on one of those days –and the cry was– Poor fellow! he has certainly drank too much cold water! Cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se- veral instances. [To be concluded in our next.],weather ID50,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,21,persuade,The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked that when this season commences early and with severity in Newfoundland and the more northern part of North America it becomes extremely rigorous and of a proportionate continuance there. When in the above climate the winters have been severe they have invariably been mild with us and vice versa. Now the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last saw the hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one nature in her bounty has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits as a nourishment to the smaller birds who would otherwise perish a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground so as to prevent their coming at the worms &c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The present season the store of these wild fruits is extremely moderate.,weather ID140,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,26,inform,Colonial IntelligenceSome Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in town.

The contagion was so rapid that it soon spread into the town shipping and country and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such it baffled all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious one man would hardly venture to touch another. The William's crew from their mutinous disposition deserted her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has become good within these fifteen days and the health of the island improving fast.'A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 20th of February have reached us. They contain no intelligence of particular interest expect that the colony appears to have been healthy at that period. In one of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that settlement. It states that the total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818 was eight men three women and two children. We lost no civil military or colonial officer excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival and is included in the number.A letter from the Havannah dated 27th February mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million sterling in that single commodity.,weather ID314,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,01,inform,Kentucky May 19. 1790.We arrived safe at this place ??? beginning of April from Pittsburgh and a dreadful passage we had of it.

From Wright's Ferry we learn that about four o'clock on Wednesday afternoon as a boat was coming from the East side a most tremendous storm arose when she was about half way over by which means she was soon filled with water and sunk. there was six passengers and the ??? in her (besides a small light waggon and three horses viz. a clergyman the owner of the waggon with his wife and three children; when the storm came on the woman and children took shelter in the waggon but it continued to blow with such violence that the waggon was torn out of the boat and the body having by chance got loose from the carriage and being pretty tight floated some distance till its progress was stopped by a rock; the husband viewing the melancholy situations of his wife and children resolved to relieve or perish with them and quitting the boat swam to the waggon cut open the cover with his knife and with difficulty kept their heads above water till they were relieved by a boat from the West side; by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappeared; the Clergyman just as he found the boat sinking mounted his horse one of the boatmen mounted on one of the waggon horses and by this means preserved themselves till they were relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the name of Tim Sulivan depending on his skill in swimming got up an oar but it is thought he is drowned as he has not since been heard of; the boat was found in the falls and one of the waggon horses that had been given up for lost was found next day some distance below the falls with all his geers on and does not appear to have received the least injury.Extract of a letter from Sunbury Northumberland County (Pennsylvania) dated Nov. 13.One of the men who murdered the Indians at Pine Creek was tried on Saturday evening and though a number of witnesses clearly proved the hand he had in perpetrating the horrid deed and the confession of his counsel at the bar that confirmed it yet notwithstanding an express charge from the judges to bring him in guilty the jury in a few moments returned with a verdict in his favour and a subscription to pay the costs of the suit that he might be immediately set at liberty; and all this from a most absurd idea which the Attorney General with all his endeavours could not beat out of them that the crime was not the same to kill an Indian as a white man: for some minuets the Chief Justice was mute with astonishment.

The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4.

April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut.

After it abated I continued on my journey but found it very difficult travelling in many places the road being blocked up by the falling of timber. I reached Wilksbarree on Wednesday. It appears that the storm extended through the country and at the same hour of the day blew more violent in some places than others. At Exeeter about nine miles from Wilksbarrie a level plain loaded with pitch pine timber was swept of its timber; scarce a tree left for more than a mile in length and three fourths of a mile wide being either torn up by the roots or twisted off leaving their stumps from 5 to 30 feet high.A number of buildings in different parts of the country stript of their roofs and otherways damaged–fences in many place removed and many fields of corn others grain and flax laid level with the earth–cattle killed by the falling of timber in every part of the country.A Mr. –Lot who lived at Mahooper about 35 miles from Wilksbarre whose family consisted of his wife and a number of children– he with his wife being absent children seeing themselves in danger in the house left it at the instant a large tree was falling; the tree reached them a small distance from the door and a girl about eleven years of age was crushed to pieces about expired instantly. One of the other children had a thigh and both arms broke another badly wounded in the head–these two it is feared has received the fatal blow two other slightly wounded.Extract of a letter from Richmond Virginia dated July 28.By accounts from Kentucky we are informed that about the 1st of this month a party of Indians appeared near Frankfort and took a great number of horses and negroes.
