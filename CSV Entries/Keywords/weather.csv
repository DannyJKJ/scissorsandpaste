Slegg arrived in the Downs which are dated the 10th of June : they contain an account of all the merchant ships which were then at that island ; that they were nearly full and were fixed to sail from thence the 26th of July and the first of August ; and that the weather continued exceedingly fine.,weather ID20,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,[Continued from our last.] Carlisle July 29.ON Saturday last between three and four o'clock P. M. happened the most violent hurricane pest or thunder storm (for we are at a lost to determine its proper name) that was ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We can conceive of nothing but an earthquake that could be attended with more alarming circumstances. The cloud from the west or rather a number of clouds of a lowering aspect furiously agitated broken and seemingly ready to fall– attracted the attention and prepared the mind in some measure for what was to follow. The lightening appeared to those who were at a distance remarkably red and seemed to flash from the cloud to the earth and back again in quick succession or some time as to appear one sheet of flame. This might have had a great effect on the air at some miles distance from town to set it in rapid motion especially when pressed down by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as thrown from buckets and being carried along and dashed against every opposing object by a most impetuous wind darkened the air in such a manner that all surrounding objects seemed lost in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole town in ruins with such irresistible force did the column of air move on: happily however the damages were much less than apprehended. The The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Davidson being an an elevated spot near the west end of the town and lying directly in the line of march of this powerful column was the first sufferer; all the parts of the building above the square were suddenly borne off and a great part of the roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house which stood at a small distance on the east striking it forcibly and injuring it greatly in its ways and fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. After injruing some smaller buildings in its course to the eastward the next elevated object to which it pointed its fury was the presbyterian church in the certain of town–a building of uncommon solidity calculated it was thought to stand for ages admist all the war of the elements. About a fourth part however of the roof of the north side was carried off with the weighty cornice and thrown to the ground at some hundred yards distance on the east side of the open square which is in the centre of this borough. After leaving the town it beat its course to the public buildings and greatly injured that range nearest the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood which were in the line of its direction were also thrown down; but how far it extended or what damages the farmers may have sustained we have not yet learned. Let it however not be forgotten that dreadful as the scene was through the good providence of God not a single life was lost or any personal injury worth mentioning received and the buildings it is hoped will soon be restored to as good a state as they were in before.,weather ID24,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,New York Aug. 20.The weather last week in this city and suburbs continued to be extremely hot until Sunday midnight after a thunder squall. The change which then took place was very sudden and unhealthy.Upwards of twenty persons fell unhappy [?]ic tions to the heat last week; and it is said that as many of them died by over labouring as by drinking cold water Raw rum has been found exceedingly pernicious in this extreme heat; –man who was seen intoxicated but a few momments before suddenly fell on one of those days –and the cry was– Poor fellow! he has certainly drank too much cold water! Cold water has however been instantaneously fatal in se- veral instances. [To be concluded in our next.],weather ID50,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,21,persuade,The following philosophical facts lead us to presume that the winter now setting in will prove a mild one : It has been constantly remarked that when this season commences early and with severity in Newfoundland and the more northern part of North America it becomes extremely rigorous and of a proportionate continuance there. When in the above climate the winters have been severe they have invariably been mild with us and vice versa. Now the ships which sailed from Newfoundland the beginning of October last saw the hills already covered with snow. There is still another argument in favour of a mild winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a severe one nature in her bounty has been always observed to have provided an uncommon store of wild briar fruits as a nourishment to the smaller birds who would otherwise perish a vast carpet of snow spreading itself over the ground so as to prevent their coming at the worms &c. on which they are accustomed to feed. The present season the store of these wild fruits is extremely moderate.,weather ID121,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1817,07,21,entertain,Emigration to America.[ Extracted from No.15 of Cobbet's Register published on Saturday 12th instant ].Cobbett's arrival in America&c.On Wednesday evening the 27th March we embarked on board the Importer D. Ogden master bound to New York where we arrived on the 5th of May with about 40 steerage passengers farmers and tradesmen who were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all respects that can be named our passage disagreeable and upon one occasion very perilous from lightning which struck the ship twice shivered two of the masts killed a man struck several people slightly between two of whom I was sitting without at all feeling the blow.Some of our fellow-passengers have found great disappointment ; and it is stated in some of the public papers here that many hundreds have during the last year accepted of the offer of our Consul at New York to go and settle in Canada. You know that I have never advised any body to emigrate. I have always said that it is no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to live without work ; no place for a farmer who does not work himself ; no place in short for any one who is not able and willing to work at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such men there is every where a plentiful happy and easy life. None should come however who have any views of idleness ; and even for the industrious poor I see no reason why they should expend their last shilling and undergo all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage in order to save those who eat the taxes the expence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and his wife and a child or two cannot come under the expence of 35 guineas at least. A single man 20 guineas before he gets into work again ; and as I always said I never would if I were in the place of such a man expend my earnings on a sea voyage and endure all its hardships in order to remove one eye sore out of the way of corruption. Besides there is the climate which is not so good as ours though it is not bad and people often live to an old age. The country is good but it will easily be conceived that new face an entire new scene a separation from every friend work done in a quite different way from it is in England ; it will easily be conceived that all this makes such a dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very unhappy for a while. Then he cannot expect to find work the first day. He must ask first at any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and they are sure to find rascals enough here to foster their disgust merely for the sake of serving the cause of corruption at home. In short I advice nobody to emigrate but I will truly describe the country and the people. As to emigrating with a view of settling and farming in the new countries it is neither more nor less than downright madness. It is what our English farmers know nothing at all about ; it is what they are not at all fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe culations end in disappointment if not in ruin and premature death. I hope that our beloved country will shortly be fit for an honest and industrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come with money in their pockets my advice is not to give way either to enthusiastic admiration or to instant disgust. But to stop a little ; to look about them ; to see not only after good land but a good market for its products. The western romance writers tell us that the land in the Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish in his valuable book tells us that beef and pork sell for three halfpence a pound. An excellent country for people who want to do nothing but eat. – Give me Long Island where the land is not too good ; but where beef and pork sell for about eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and where there is a ready market for every species of produce. One thing above all ; if an English farmer (I mean by English people of the whole of the United Kingdom) comes here with money in his pocket let him resolve to keep it there for a year and then he will be sure to do well. – All that I see around me here is well calculated to attract the attention and to please the sight of one like myself brought up in the country always greatly delighted with and somewhat skilled in various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The The people are engaged busily in planting their Indian corn. The cherry trees of which there are multitudes planted in long avenues or rows or round the fields have dropped their blossom and begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple and pear orchards in extent from one to twenty acres on each farm are in full and beautiful bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no appearance of want amongst the labourers who receive in the country about two shillings and threepence (our money) a-day with board and lodging and which board consists of plenty of excellent meat and fish of all sorts the best of bread butter cheese and eggs. That you may form some idea as to prices of living I will state a few facts which have already come within my own knowledge. We are at present at an inn thirteen miles from New York. It is on the road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the day passes without a carriage of some sort offering for going thither and to go by the regular stage costs three shillings. Mind I shall always speak in English money when I do not speak of dollars. We lodge and board in this inn have each a bed-room and good bed have a room to sit in ourselves ; we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. – We have smoked fish chops butter and eggs for breakfast with bread (the very finest I ever sa) crackers sweet cakes ; and when I say that we have such and such things I do not mean that we get them for show or just enough to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg but a dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and coffee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle nut but in good thumping pieces. For dinner we have the finest of fish bass mackerel lobsters ; of meat lamb veal ham &c. ; asparagus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle of May). The supper is like the breakfast with preserved peaches and other things. And with all this an excellent cyder to drink with the kindest and most obliging treatment on the part of the landlord and landlady and their sons and daughters we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week each. In England the same food and drink and lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same sum every day. But there are two things which no money can purchase any where. The first is no grumbling on the part of the landlady except on account of our eating and drinking too little ; and the other is that Mr Wiggins has no fastening but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the door to a house which is full of valuable things of all sorts and about which we leave all our things much more carelessly than we should do in our own house in any part of England. Here then are we able to live at an inn one of the most respectable in the whole country at the rate of fifty pounds a year while the pay of a common farming man is not much short of that sum.,weather ID126,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1818,01,28,inform,CanadaExtract of a letter from a Mercantile House in Nova Scotia to their Correspondents in this quarter.We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in contemplation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into Great Britain and Ireland from the British North American Provinces equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign Timber in 1813 will be further suspended.Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encouragement of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] bring us [?] at a low freight whereby we are enabled to furnish the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?] and that on very moderate terms ; but in the event of Government persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring Provinces.The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother country upon trial will be found delusive ; to prove this many obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists all the Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ireland is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky an article as Timber and the import of so ponderous an article as [?] employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be denied that previous to 1813 when the additional Duty was laid on Foreign Timber they (the Foreigners) were not only the carriers but would not accept an ounce of British Manufacture in payment for their TImber–no nothing but you gold[?] which was so much in demand that 28s. was given for a [?]. Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provinces ; it facilitates emigration and introduces many valuable settlers into this Province and the Canadas that would go to the States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when they would of accessity[?] become our enemies.When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eastern countries from whence the principal supply of Timber was derived the merchants in that line[?] as well as the ship-masters were not only alarmed but convinced themselves ruined ! The Baltic is shut[?] what shall we do for Timber and with our ships? They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could supply them ; they made the experiment they were not disappointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If therefore in time of war Britain has took to her colonies for a supply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected when blessed with peace.Extract of a Letter dated Savannah 25th Nov. 1817In the Southern States this autumn has been the most fatal they have experienced since their colonization. Many thousands have been hurried off to that narrow house destined for all that live. A most malignant fever has prevailed to an alarming extent. In this city during the last four months the deaths have been equal to one-eights of the inhabitants left in it ; and in Beaufort (S. Carolina) and in some of the Southern Counties the morality has exceeded one-sixth!,weather ID140,Aberdeen Journal,Aberdeen,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,26,inform,Colonial IntelligenceSome Canada papers to the 11th let. have arrived in town. Sir Peregrine Maitland had summoned the Parliament of Upper Canada to meet him at York on the 22d of April. He had appointed Port Talbot in the town of Dunwich a port of entry in the same manner as those established between Canada and the United Statess.Extract of a letter to a Gentleman in George-town dated Tobago Feb. 9. 1819.–' The heavy rains which continued during the months of December and January almost inundated the country which brought on a most rapid and fatal disease which made its first appearance in the frost at a short distance from the town consisting of 212 men strong and in 10 or 12 days 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. The contagion was so rapid that it soon spread into the town shipping and country and proved equally fatal. The disorder was such it baffled all medical aid. The alarming symptoms were such that business was nearly suspended–the white population seeking safety in other islands or in the remote and healthiest part of this. I assure you that every thing had a most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so contagious one man would hardly venture to touch another. The William's crew from their mutinous disposition deserted her–some have since died ; and some remain sick. The weather has become good within these fifteen days and the health of the island improving fast.'A series of Sierra Leone Gazettes to the 20th of February have reached us. They contain no intelligence of particular interest expect that the colony appears to have been healthy at that period. In one of them we find a contradiction of the reports which found their way into the English papers some months since of the dreadful mortality that prevailed in that settlement. It states that the total number of Europeans who died in the Peninsula in 1818 was eight men three women and two children. We lost no civil military or colonial officer excepting one young Gentleman who died a month after his arrival and is included in the number.A letter from the Havannah dated 27th February mentions that the article of coffee is gradually rising in value and that an agent from Messrs Baring is making purchases there to the amount of 1/3 a million sterling in that single commodity.,weather ID244,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1834,09,24,inform,The St Nicholas Morgan which has arrived off Aberdeen from Bathurst New South Wales reports that timber was very scarce ; that the woods between that town and Miramichi were on fire ; that 250 tons of cut timber had been burnt and the people in the woods had been obliged to abandon their camps and fly to save their lives. The thermometer at Bathurst was from 85 to 90.,weather ID257,Scotsman,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1836,04,09,inform,Sir George Clerk.–As the cawing of the rooks portends a storm it is worth while to mention that the cunning baronet has come down from London and commenced a canvass in this county within these few days. It is stated we believe upon good authority that he accounts for this course of proceeding by referring to the great probability of the Lords throwing out the Irish Municipal Bill.Burn's Monument.–We understand that there is now an early prospect of the completion of this monument which has too long remained in an unfinished state to the surprise of strangers and the discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already in the Treasurer's hands aided by the profits of the handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod which he has generously devoted to that purpose is now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the expense requird for the railing in and decoration of the ground around the monument. We expect therefore that the work will forthwith be commenced and if a few pounds are still wanted we have no doubt there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would willingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by the immediate completion of the undertaking.Annuity Tax.–We understand that deputations from several places in the country are expected to attend the public meeting which is to be held on Tuesday evening for the purpose of petitioning Parliament for the abolition of the Annuity Tax in order to testify their abhorrence of that system of politico Christianity which requires distraint and imprisonment for its support. We observe that Mr Gillon of Wallhouse M.P. is to take the chair. The meeting we doubt not will be most numerously attended.Law of Scotland.–The prizes given by Professor Bell for the greatest proficiency in the examinations were yesterday awarded to Mr William Neish 25 India Street in the senior and to William Spence 31 Broughton Place in the junior class. The following gentlemen also distinguished themselves in the competition : Mr John Fraser James Gilchrist James Mason James Scott in the senior class; James Oliver David Gale John R. Banks James Charles Murray Wm. M'Naughton in the junior.Kilwinning March 30.–The United Associate Presbytery of Kilmarnock met at Kilwinning on Tuesday the 22d March and ordained Mr A. Macgregor to the pastoral charge of the congregation in that place. The Rev. D. Henderson of Dalry preached and presided. The Rev. Mr Cairns of Stewarton ordained and the Rev D. Ronald of Saltcoats gave the charge to the minister and congregation. On the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr Tait of Barrhead introduced Mr Macgregor to his congregation ; and there is every prospect that the hitherto long disappointed congregation of Kilwinning will now prosper under the pastoral care of their much esteemed and highly talented young minister.Presentation of Plate.–Mr A. S. Walker late of the Commercial Bank of Scotland at present manager of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England at Uttoxeter in Staffordshire was lately presented with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that establishment bearing the following inscription :– Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker by the Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of England as a small acknowledgement of his faithful and valuable services–March 1836. This is another proof of the estimation in which many of the young men are held who have been trained to the banking system in this country. From a Return just published we find that the emigration to Canada has been comparatively small last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at Quebec and Montreal in 1835 was 12527 : in 1831 and 1832 four times and in 1834 two times as many were sent out. Of the 12527 there were 5597 adult males 3866 females and 3064 children under 14 years. Of the whole number 1043 were sent out by parochial aid. The numbers from the three kingdoms were– England 3067 Ireland 7108 Scotland 2127 From Newfoundland Nova Scotia &c. 225 Settled in Lower Canada 2297 Upper Canada 9800 Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec 13 Returned to the United Kingdom 117 Removed to the United States 300 –12527But besides those who went to Canada 16749 landed at New York raising the whole number of emigrants to 29376. There were no less than three vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 passengers all saved–the barque James from Newfoundland all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from Cork with 48 persons on board passengers and crew of whom 41 were lost.From another part of the Report we find that 2764 female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year under the superintendence of the Emigration Committee. Of these 2105 had a free passage. The arrangements seem to have been ood ; for the mortality was small and few complaints were made. The females were all of decent character and due care was taken on their arrival to get them disposed of as servants in situations where their morals would not be exposed to unnecessary risk.Ulster Railway.–Length 36 miles from Belfast to Armagh ; capital t600000 in 12000 shares of which t393000 are subscribed. The number of passengers expected is 450000; the expected income is t93000 of which t67800 is from passengers ; the estimated expense of the work is t539000. The steepest gradient is 1 in 200. There are 3 tunnels of 310 320 and 570 yards in length.East Lothian Railway.–We call attention with great pleasure to the Prospectus of a railway from Dunbar to Edinburgh by Haddington and Tranent which appears in our first page. No one can have travelled over the ground without observing how admirably it is fitted for this species of communication by its remarkable uniformity of surface. We should have doubted whether such a work would pay had it terminated at Edinburgh ; but as a part of an unbroken line reaching across the most fertile and populous parts of Scotland from the German ocean to the Atlantic its chances of success are vastly increased.Dundee and Arbroath Railway.–The Committee's report on this railway has reached us but we must confine ourselves to an abstract. The length is 16 miles 5 furlongs and 90 yards ; the capital t100000 divided into 4000 shares which is all subscribed but authority is taken to raise t40000 more by loan ; sum paid up t5000 ; subscribed by shareholders locally interested t88900 by others t7150 : there are three subscribers for t2000 and upwards : the expected income from passengers is t16912 goods t14654 from both t31566. There are no tunnels no inclined planes and the steepest gradient being only 1 in 1000 scarcely differs from a dead level. It does not cross any highway or turnpike on a level. The estimated expenses is t99844.Statute Labour Acts.–It appears from the votes of the House of Commons that a Select Committee has been appointed to investigate the Scottish Statute Labour Acts and to consider what amendments may be made thereon. It may be stated that by the present act for this county proprietors of land and several other descriptions of people are totally exempted from any burden on account of the coaches chaises gigs or saddle horses they may keep though it is quite plain good roads are of as much advantage to them as to the occupiers of land upon whom almost the sole burden is thrown. In many parishes a considerable addition would be made to the road funds were no such exemptions allowed. At present the management is vested in heritors rated at one hundred pounds Scots and upwards though it is stated with confidence that were the occupiers of land included beneficial consequences would follow.–East- Lothian Correspondent.Leith Mechanics' Friendly Assurance Society.– The fifth annual meeting of this Institution was held on Tuesday last–John Hutton Esq. one of the Honorary Members President of the Society in the chair. A very satisfactory report for the last year was read and thanks were voted to the different Office bearers. It appears that this society was established under the countenance of the Magistrates and Ministers and various influential individuals in Leith and is well deserving of encouragement as affording the benefits of mutual insurance to the working classes the lowest rates consistent with perfect security. The funds we understand are in a prosperous state.Hay and Straw.–In consequence of it having been alleged last Wednesday that higher prices were got for straw than those quoted we have made due inquiry and find there are no grounds for such an allegation. We have been further assured that in reporting the prices of hay and straw for these two years past the clerk of the corn market has never shown a desire to favour the farm servants at the expense of their employers or to favour either party at the expense of the public.The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty have been pleased to grant by their warrant dated the 6th of April 1836 a distinguishing flag to be worn by the respective vessels belonging to the Eastern Regatta Club of Scotland viz. a blue cornet flag with a white St Andrew's cross on the upper quarter on a red field.Heriot's Hospital.–At the meeting of the Governors of George Heriot's Hospital on Thursday the 7th instant the estimate of Messrs Trotter for alterations and repairs on the chapel amounting to t935 was accepted and it will gratify the friends of economy to learn that this is t65 under the sum voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended improvements on the chapel which was described by Councillor Grant and others as highly creditable to the skill and good taste of that distinguished architect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the list of applications for admission of boys preparatory to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 vacancies and 37 applicants who may be thus classed :–Those who have never received benefit from George Heriot's Hospital or any other institution 12 Those who have received benefit for one child 13 Do. for two children 6 Do. for three children 5 Do. for five children 1 37In considering cases the present practise of the Governors is to give preference first to children of widows (being poor) then to those who have never received benefit afterwards those who have had only one child in and so on. These were but three applications for widow's children and one for an orphan out of the above number and it is therefore probable considering the large population of Edinburgh that it is not sufficiently known that George Heriot in his will expressly points out the fatherless and poor being children of burgesses and freemen as the objects of his charity–hence if there be not a sufficient numbers of really necessitous cases the Governors in filling up the vacancies may elect some that do not appear to have strong claims simply from those that have such claims not coming forward in sufficient numbers. Political Economy.–On Thursday last the course of lectures on Political Economy delivered by Dr Thomas Murray in Elder Street Chapel was brought to a conclusion ; on which occasion the thanks of the meeting were on the motion of one of the members of committe voted by acclamation to the lecturer for his valuable services. After thanks had been returned by Dr Murray Mr A. G. Hunter merchant was called to the Chair and some conversation having taken place the committee of management who had necessarily been self-elected were confirmed by the meeting in their office and empowered to take such steps as they might think expedient for obtaining lectures to the industrious classes next winter. We understand that Dr Murray is to be entertained at supper some evening next week on the occasion of being presented with a piece of silver plate.It is with much regret we learn that John Grieve Esq. of Newington Cottage died on Monday last. He was beloved and esteemed for his estimable qualities by all who had the pleasure of his acquaintance and his death will be long and deeply regretted.Rare Sights in London.–A young Scottish Miss who had voyaged the length of London on a pleasure jaunt returned the other day by one of the steamers and was met on landing by various members of her family who anxiously inquired what she had seen in London. Seen ! exclaimed the fair tourist I have seen such sights ! I saw the Theological Garden and all the wild beasts in't!The Theatre.–Mr C. Kean concluded his engagement on Thursday evening–an engagement the longest and most brilliant of any that our Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean has been with us for a whole month and has succeeded in crowding the house almost every night. We understand that upwards of 30000 persons have visited the theatre during his engagement–a number beyond that of any former period of equal duration. In that time he has appeared in some of the most arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters Hamlet Richard Macbeth Othello Shylock and King John investing each with its own peculiar charms and interest and exciting the highest admiration and astonishment at the versatility and power of his genius which could give such individuality and truth to so many dissimilar distinct and separate classes of characters. The play with which his engagement concluded was Richard which character he has performed seven times during his engagement ; the house was as usual crowded in every part and he exerted himself most strenuously and successfully. At the conclusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loudly called for appeared in front of the stage and delivered the following very neat and appropriate address:–Ladies and Gentlemen–I now stand before you for the last time this season but believe me whichever way my pilgrimage may bend my thoughts will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to its distant home fondly anticipating the hour when he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheering.) Till that period permit me with a heavy but a grateful heart to pronounce that melancholy word– farewell. (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) –Mr K. we perceive appears next in Aberdeen where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his performances. The boxes there we are told are already taken for several successive nights to come.– Mrs Honey from the Theatre Royal Haymarket makes her appearance here on Monday first.On Wednesday evening Mr John G. Moxey baker Castle Street was entertained at supper in Menzie's Hotel and Tavern Waterloo Place by a party of friends of about fifty in number previous to his leaving this country for America to which he is about to emigrate. The company was very harmonious and the compliment must have been very gratifying to Mr Moxey.Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.–The Presbytery of Cupar at their meeting on the 29th ult. elected the Earl of Leven and Melville and Walter Malcolm Esq. Edinburgh to represent them in the ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Captain Hay of Mugdrum who is principal heritor in the parish of Newburgh and was lately ordained an elder there. Against his election to serve in the Assembly a protest and appeal were taken on the grounds as we understand that he has no domicile within the bounds of Presbytery and is not an officiating elder; the protesters allowing that his election though consistent with the letter is contrary to the spirit of an act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is sustained it is evident that a large proportion of the Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill Esq. that when the commissions came to be attested he would move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a clerical member had the candour to say he should wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves in that respect.The University of St Andrews has just conferred the degree of Doctor of Divinity on the Rev. Professor Paxton of Edinburgh. In bestowing this public honour on one who during a long and useful life has done so much for the cause of literature and religion the members of the College have done an act which shows that they can appreciate real merit and which will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious public of Scotland. Those who have had the good fortune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor Paxton and even the general church-going community are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence of the pious and heartfelt warmth and of the classical elegance which have long characterised his public preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which he is the ornament he is well known as one of the most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In his lectures on Theology as Professor to the General Associate Synod and afterwards to the Associate Synod he displayed the results of an extensive and profound critical study of the Scriptures and of an unwearied research into the Natural History and the manners and usages of the ancients nations. The work by which he is chiefly known as an author– The Illustrations of Scripture–will long bear testimony to the extent of his learning and of his Oriental investigations and to his powers of lucid and eloquent composition. We understand that the attention of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the same field of study reflects high honour on the discrimination and the heart of Mr Tennant.Public Dinner to Professor Dick.–On Tuesday last the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary College and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts of Scotland entertained Professor Dick to a public dinner in the Waterloo Hotel.

The particulars relative to the latter are as follow–The boat was attacked by about 60 or 70 Indians and the flankets that were on shore as a guard were fired on by them. –Immediately after firing they gave the Indian whoop and rushing on the flankets scalped them every one (about 22)– they then fired at the boat but did no damage as it required some time to make their way into the river. After the savages had executed this terrible act of barbarity they continued on the river watching for other boats. In the course of about six days five or six boats happened to come down the river–the savages attacked the foremost of them in which were two young ladies of the name Macdonald a young gentleman and some others passengers and took it. Elevated with this easy capture they imagined themselves capable of taking every boat they might fall in with–In a little time a second boat hove in fight which they attacked with great fury–they were in three canoes each canoe containing about twenty–they moved towards the boat as it came down and commenced firing; after discharging their guns they retreated loading and came on a second time fired and repeated nine different times; as often as they come on there was a brisk firing kept up from the boat which contained nine fighting men;– during the conflict two were killed and five wounded; two only remained to protect the boat and prevent the Indians from boarding it which every appearance of their conduct plainly indicated–These two brave fellows exerted themselves in a peculiar manner–on a near approach of the ??? they threw billets of wood at them and one of them took up an ax as a weapon of defence should they persist in boarding which the Indians perceiving and as is supposed their ammunition being expended they retreated without accomplishing their object.These inhuman monsters previous to their attacking the last mentioned boat placed the two young ladies in front of their canoes in which situation they were both killed. A few days after this transaction they fired at another boat and killed one young man. In short every boat tat has gone down the river lately has been fired at except our's. We saw no Indians; the places where the above depredation happened we passed in the night.Boston May 4.

April 30.Yesterday morning about one or two o'clock the ship Termagant belonging to the house of Messrs. Claggen lying in the stream opposite this town was discovered on fire. The inhabitants of the town and the seamen in the harbour speedily collected but on account of a quantity of powder that was on board the efforts that otherwise would have been exerted to extinguish the flames were withholden. The first soon communicated itself to the powder; and the explosion was so severe as sensibly to shake mot of the houses in the town. The cinders and pieces of the ship were flying in every direction and it and it was with the greatest difficulty that in counting store and dwelling houses on the water side were prevented from sharing a similar fate with the ship. The extensive tobacco trade warehouse the property of Francis and Charles Loundes situated at some distance from the water wherein upwards of1000 hogsheads of tobacco were stored was several times in different places on fire ut happily extinguished without sustaining much damage. The loss occasioned by this alarming element must be great indeed as the ship was large and nearly new; besides there were goods to a considerable amount and a pretty large sum of money on board of her: all of which (excepting a part of the money which has since been found) was destroyed. We are informed that this accident proceeded from the steward's falling to sleep and leaving a candle burning in the cabbin which by some means or other set fire to the sails that were stowed there. It had got far advanced before it was discovered. Providentially no lives were lost.Pittsburgh May 21. A letter received in this town on Sunday last from Lieut.
