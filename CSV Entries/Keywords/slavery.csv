Our charity therefore if we have any of these articles to spare must be first extended to our own Colonies ; and we cannot be surprised particularly when we consider the present price of bread at home that no assistance can be given at present either to the French or Dutch.The crops in the island of Jamaica promise a most plentiful harvest except to the eastward which ahs generally been considered as the most productive part.By the Westmoreland just arrived from Jamaica we learn that the slaves have become mutinous to an alarming degree ever since they were made acquainted with the intended abolition of the Slave Trade. ID12,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,24,inform,A letter from the Bay of Honduras dated May 26 says The Spaniards who pay an annual visit to this settlement to prevent encroachments are destroying all the cultivated spots on shore alledging that the settlers are prohibited by the convention from cultivation of any kind. This will prove a temporary misfortune to the woodcutters by depriving them of the principal means of subsisting their negroes and might be productive of mischief were it not that the British Superintendant Colonel Despar with the assistance of the Calypso sloop of war keeps the woodcutters in order. This may rise the price of mahogany at home and certainly will raise provisions here. ID25,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,11,20,inform,We have been favoured by a friend with the following extract of a letter from Grenada by the last West India Packet.A Mr. C– has just arrive here from Martinico where he left the white inhabitants in arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea that the Parliament of England had set the English negroes free ; where upon those on several of the most considerable estates assembled together to the amount of 4000 and retired to the mountains declaring they would no longer be slaves ; saying that they had as good a right to be free as the negroes in the English islands. What has been the event is unknown ; but some reports say that they had arms and had resisted the military and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken and condemned to die. It is a little singular that such an alarming spirit of discontent should first make its appearance among the French negroes if they are (as has been assented by several writers) so much more civilized so much better treated than those of the English islands. God knows what bloodshed may soon follow from the mistaken humanity of some well meaning but ill informed leaders among you. ID40,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,14,inform,Extract of a letter from Dominica Sept. 6.This day week the most diabolical design that that ever was formed was discovered in Martinico : It was an insurrection of the negroes who were that night to have set fire to the large and beautiful town of St. Pierre ; while the white people were all in confusion and striving to escape the flames they were to be butchered indiscriminately man woman and child.–The combustibles were laid in upwards of 100 houses consisting of hemp dipped in turpentine. The plot was not discovered till five o'clock in the evening when a negro belonging to an old lady stung with remorse on thinking that he must murder the woman who brought him up form a child disclosed it to her. The Troops being thereupon assembled 40 of the negroes were taken armed with a hanger and a long knife the insturments which were in a few hours to have put a period to the existence of upwards of 5000 people. All the inhabitants have been under arms ever since as they are afraid the negroes will attemp to release the 40 who are in gaol. ID58,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,entertain,An American paper printed in March last contains an eulogism of the highest strain on a gentleman who had from pure motives of religion and humanity restored 75 blacks his property to that natural freedom which is the right of all mankind. ID141,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1819,05,27,inform,Extract of a letter from William Hunt esq. To H. Hunt esq.Washington Hotel New Orleans Dec. 25. 1818.My Dear Brother – We arrived safe in the mouth of the Mississippi on the 10th of this month after a voyage of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in excellent health and very happy. There are 35 English vessels from Liverpool now here and a great many English emigrants from Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lancashire Wiltshire Hampshire and Somersetshire ; and in fact from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed island we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a week in the river about 80 miles below New Orleans ; we all went on shore and had plenty of rabbit shooting. I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun by Knock corner of Fetter-lane. Henry myself and Mr Blake went one day into the woods to kill deer by night coming on we lost our road ; and differing in opinions we separated Henry and Mr Blake taking one road and myself the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods and did not return to us till the next morning. It being wet and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground in spite of the remonstrances of Mr Blake caught a severe cold and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In the river there are thousands of wild swans wild geese wild ducks woodcocks snipes and other wild fowl. If you were there you would kill a waggon load in a day as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in England ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms with them and very cheap. No game certificate required here. Myself Henry Mr Blake and the other passengers visited a French farmer about six miles below New Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land whereon are sugar plantations sugar-houses & c. ; he made 250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – They are very lazy bad managers and appear to use their negroes very cruel and work them very hard. The Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and Staines and many of the buildings are as handsome as those of Bath. Here is one Church which is a very beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spanish shops are all open and it is a market during the whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening gambling & c. We are at the Washington Hotel the best in the city ; it is expensive although very good living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each including claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm weather as in England and it is as warm here now as it was in England in July although not half so oppressive and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the election : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel most of them English. We do not trouble ourselves about politics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday we were charged 100 dollars each for passage and four dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four quarters of the best peas rye grass seed and some more of Hill's Scots ploughs to be left at Messrs Brown and Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. Mr Trimmer an Englishman has purchased 20000 acres of land near Mr Birkbeck and has taken twenty couple of hounds with him so that we shall have some hunting as well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought over some with me but they may follow us ; as I understand the labourers with the pay of a dollar a day can live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply and others that I have seen from Illinois report that the farmer can get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is a good sure market and a fair profit and only one penny per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to pay. Price of labour is very dear here ; we pay a dollar for washing every dozen of shirts cravats pocket handkerchiefs & c. & c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things shipped from England I have paid 92 dollars for. Although I should like England very well if it was not for the taxes yet from what I have seen hitherto I like America ten times better ID330,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1791,01,07,entertain,New-York Oct. 11. We are informed that the census of Philadelphia is completed and that the city is found to contain fifty three thousand inhabitants.A Petersburgh (Virginia) paper of the 30th ult. informs the public of that state that a serious petition is now drawing up to be presented to the next congress stating arguments in favour of polygamy from the plain principles of reason; and praying that a man may legally marry two wives. This it is thought will be the most effectual means to extirpate the numerous race of old maids and increase the population of the United States. The petition is to be presented by a gentleman residing at Cabin Point.Oct 12. In one of the Charleston papers of the 16th ult. appears the epistle from the yearly meeting of the Quakers in London to the friends in Great Britain Ireland and America. It is remarkable that in the re-publication of this episstle in the Carolina paper the whole paragraph relative to theslave trade and negro slavery is omitted.Oct. 13. The ship Betsy Rook arrived on the 6th instant at Wilmington Delaware from Londonderry in Ireland. This vessel brought in a large number of Irish emigrants some of them people of property; who weary of the patronage of their old tutelar saint St. Patrick have come to settle themselves and their posterity in America under the more liberal auspices of St. Tammany.The following letter was written from a young heir to the Probate Judge–Sir–My father departed this life not long hence and has left a widow and five scorpions.

And as in duty bound ??? ??? pray &c.Extract of a letter from a gentleman in the county of Lincoln Massachusets dated Sept. 14.We have had a very wet season here since you went from us and the grass hoppers are innumerable; they have eat up all the gardens and all the grass; of course as the natural consequences we have no milk neither shall we have any beef or butter this season; the corn has also suffered very much from those insectsExtract of a letter from Banbury (Georgia) Sept. 20A firm peace being now to all appearance secured between the United States and the Creek Indians we may reasonable expect that the state of Georgia will soon begin to feel the good effects. The immediate beneficial consequences are already at this moment taking place. The vast tracts of fertile lands on both sides of the Altamahaw river are rapidly rising in value and nothing is wanting here (to compensate for the scarcity of slaves) but a hardy and industrious race of men who instead of being mere lookers on in quality of overseers and drivers would condescend to put their own hand to the axe or grubbing hoe and make this extensive territory one of the most desirable in the habitable world. The country round Sapola Sound and the mouth of Altamahaw is one of the most beautiful you can imagineabounding with everything that can make life comfortable besides an excellent navigation and easy bar at the north end of Sapola with rather more water than that of Charleston. Several vessels are hourly looked for from France (one in particular of 800 tons from Bourdeaux) to load with live oak ship timber and ??? in the river of St. Mary's.Extract of a letter from Hampton (Virginia) Sept. 25. There are two articles produced in the greatest abundance on different parts adjoining James river the exportations of which in the opinion of rational men ought to be considered as of the greatest importance to this state. These articles are coals and clays for the several colours of paint which may be had in any quantity and may be afforded at moderate prices. The mines of coal from every discovery we have been able to make are inexhaustible; all the samples however that you have yet seen are mere pickings up on the surface and there is reason to believe that the deeper we shall descend the better will be the quality of the coal. When once a company can be estblished with funds sufficient to take this matter in hand there is no doubt but that we can supply the different capital of the United States with coal equally good with that from Europe and at a much a more moderate price than that frequently brought. As to our paints there are none better in the world and in quantity when manufactured. Several gentlemen in the country up the river of property and enterprize are beginning to turn their attention to these branches; and with all submissions to our legislature it is thought that these two articles are by no means objects beneath their attention.Extract of a letter from Charleston Sept. 27.On Sunday last weas launched at Mr. Pri?chard's ship yard Hubcaw a fine new brig calculated to carry 700 barrels of rice the property of Mr. Hary Grant and is to be called the Pringle. A number of spectators collected from the city to view the pleasing sight with which they were no less delighted than with the liberal en tertainment and polite attention of Mr. O???.Boston Sept. 28. Yesterday sailed from this port the ship Columbia Capt. Robert Gray on a circum navigation voyage to the North-West coast of America.–This is the second voyage the Columbia has made to our coast–too much praise cannot be given to the gentlemen owners of the ship for their exertion in extending the commerce of America. The native of ??? has returned to the place of its nativity.Dr. FRANKLIN Never declare yourself the author of a ??? without being beyond doubt certain of ??? was the Doctor's advice. He generally enforced his percepts by giving an example.I had been with a number of my acquaintance taking the diversion of a dance at an inn. The fiddler stepped out to get some refreshment. the tavern keeper came in and advised us in a very warm manner to make a collection for the fiddler who had been scraping his cat gut several hours in our service; we apparently agreed and he well pleased with the success of his persuasion went for his hat to collect what we were willing to give. We took up an old newspaper tore it into small pieces which we carefully folded and put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes round the room and we very gravely drop our paper in his hat. The fiddler returns and the landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self approbation boasts of what he had been doing for him; It was I persuaded them to make the collection I made them give I went round to every one and see what I have got. If it had not been for me–the fiddler examines his prize and discovers the cheat–he vents all his anger upon the poor landlord's shoulders who thus suffered for proclaiming himself the author of a project before its success was fully ascertained. ID97,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1794,09,12,entertain,The laws of the State of Pennsylvania and that of Massachusetts by which the punishment of death is abolished in all cases except for wilful murder are about to be adopted by the respective Legislatures of all the other States. The system of the great and merciful ???caria has taken place of the sanguinary Penal laws of England.The abolition ofNegro slavery which has taken shape in the five New England States of New Hampshire Massachusets Rhode island Connecticut and Vermont; in the Midland States of New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delawar; and in the Western State of Kentucky for several years past is now extended by act of Congress to the Southern States of Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia and Maryland; and the emancipation of the remainder of that unfortunate race of men is to take place on or before the fifth of November 1795.The Legislature of the State of Massachusetts has g???ed a part of the public lands to the emancipated Negroes of that State in proportion to the numbers of the respective families where the liberal and philanthropic mind is gratified by seeing them erect villages cultivate farms and form communities of civilized Societies.Before the Gentleman who has favoured us with this Intelligence left America they had established a Lodge of Masonry; and he had the satisfaction of seeing them on a grand day parade to Church in all the magnificence of the Order where a sermon was preached on the occasion by one of their own colour. They have also endowed public schools employed ??? and erected places of Public Worship.The Officers Non-commissioned Officers and Soldiers who served in the Continental army and established the Liberty of their Country have at last received a reward infinitely beyond their expectations but every way corresponding with the liberty of a great and rising Republic.Five hundred acres of land have been voted by Congress this last Session to each individual who served throughout the war; and to the defendants of those who fell in contending for the Rights of Nature and eequal proportion to those who served for a shorter period; and to prevent its being sold at a price under its real value to the injury of the Patriotic Veteran as has been the case of former grants he is allowed his option of taking its value in sterling money at the present market price from the Treasure of the States; or any part in land and the rest in moneya s may be most agreeable to the receiver.The Mint of the United States which was established two years since has begun to issue its hold and silver coin: the copper has been delivered some time. The gold coins are eagles half eagles and quarter eagles.The first is exactly five and forty shillings English money or ten American coin.The dollars are coined in the same divisions of half and quater which makes the courie of exchange simple and suits the reckoning to a very capacity–as our Readers will perceive that ten quarter dollars make the quarter eagle; ten half dollars the half eagle; and ten dollars the eagle.There is besides one more silver coin which is called a Dime and is the tenth part of a dollar.The copper coin is called a Cent and is the tenth part of a Dime.Six of the ships of war which were voted by Congress in November last are completed and put in commission: the remaining twenty four will be ready by Midsummer next and will complete a fleet of ??? hundred guns.The city of Washington which in five years more will be the Capital of the United States will in every respect be the first in the world: the Capitol or Congress House is situated upon a beautiful eminence and c??? a full and complete view of every part of the city as well as a considerable extent of the country around. The President's house likewise stands upon a rising ground near the banks of the Potamac possessing a delightful water prospect together with a commanding view of the Capitol and some other material parts of the city.From the President's house to the Capitol run two great pleasure parks or malls which intersect and terminate upon the banks of the Potomac and are ornamented at the sides by elegant buildings for Foreign Ministers. The four fronts of the Capitol as well as those of the President's house are of the finest marble. The building of these superb edifices has been much retarded by the want of stone cutters masons bricklayers carpenters and blacksmiths who at this time actually receive the enormous wages of ten shillings American currency per day.The district of Country at the back of North Carolina reaching to the Mississippi and covering a country six hundred miles long by three hundred broad is next winter to be formed into a Sixteenth State; and the Province of Maine extending from the borders of New Hampshire to the river St. Croix is expected to form a Seventeenth.The new cities build in America since her independence are Grenville in the State of Georgia; Martenberg the Capitol of North Carolina; Columbia the Capital of South Carolina; Noxville and Nashville in the Tenesee Settlements; Danville Fairfield and Lex ington in the State of Kentucky; Washington the Capital of the United States; Sunbury in the State of Pennsylvania; Hudson upon Husdon's River and Cooper's Town in the State of New York; Bennington in the State of Vermont; and Paterson in the State of New Jersey. All the towns burnt by the English in the was have been rebuilt and the old cities of Charlestown Baltimore Philadelphia New York and Boston have been extended to more than double the extent they had before the peace.The population of the United States by the last Census in 1790 was more than double what it was in 1775 by which it appears that America doubles her number of people every fifteen years. The emigrations from the different nations in Europe to that country are esimated at one hundred and sixty thousand annually. The increase of farms and villages has been so great as to people four new States and to extend their Settlements from the Atlantic to the Ohio in the South and from the Atlantic to the Lakes on the River St. Lawrence in the North. ID344,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,17,inform,Kingston Feb. 6.By a St. Christopher's paper of the 25th ult. we learn that the small-pox raged lately at >Surinam to such a degree that within the space of two months upwards of 2500 persons had perished by that disorder.A very severe shock of an earthquake was felt between give and six on the evening of last Thursday se'ennight at the settlements near the Blue Mountains.On Wednesday the 3d instant arrived at Lucca the ship Pitt Captain Hunter from Africa with154 Gold-Coast Negroes. On the passage from Africa nine of the seamen mutined whom Captain Hunter has brought confined in irons and they are to be tried at a Court of Admiralty Sessions.Feb. 20. Very strong suspicions are entertained by the Americans that the Indian Chief M' Gilveray and the nations under his immediate controul or in alliance with him are subsidied by the King of Spain. It is a well known fact that they are regularly supplied with cloathing arms and ammunition from the Royal Magazines at St. Augustine and Pensacola and therefore in all probability; the sword not the olive branch will be the most speedy and effectual agent for terminating the disputes.March 6. Tuesday last arrived in the harbour of Port Royal from Cork his Majesty's ship Chichester of 44 guns armed en flute Lieutenant Craven Commander having on board the first battalion of the first or Royal Regiment of of foot commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Dundas.

Hunter came out with the earl of Effingham; it is therefore probable that the disputes which have so long subsisted between Lieutenant Colonel Despard and the inhabitants of the Bay of Honoduras will be brought to a speedy determination.At the sale of the late Peter Heningson's estatea negro blacksmith was sold for the extraordinary sum of two hundred and sixty pounds!At two o'clock on Tuesday morning the 3d regiment quitted the barracks in this town and at Up Park Camp and embarked on board the Chichester for Great Britain; the 14th at the same time taking possession of their quarters.Advice is received from St. Mark's in Hispaniola that on the 1st of this month a number of free people of colour to the amount of 700 and upwards having possessed themselves of several field pieces formed a camp in that districh and exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarming. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent from the Assembly to demand the reason of so extraordinary a proceeding the insurgents demanded that a remonstrance which they then delivered to the deputies should be presented imimmediately to the general and that an answer thereto should be given without delay. The paper being conveyed as they desired proved to be a sensible and well written detail of the various claims the free people of colour had on what they termed the justice of the whites with whom they demanded an equal participation of all rights and immunities whatsoever–the privilege of representation and of qualifying for all the learned professions–and concluding with the avowal of a determination to proceed to extremities should their demands be treat with neglect.On the perusal of this paper it was judged adviseable to assemble a body of the militia who headed by the General immediately went against the camp. On their arrival the insurgents fired and fled to the mountains; three or four of the whites were killed and one of the ringleaders was taken and instantly beheaded.A proclamation was then issued offering a reward of 50 half joes for the head of any principal offender and in the course of a few days not less than twenty seven were brought in. On Sunday the 7th instant a very great majority of those who had formed the camp finding all their attempts completely frustrated came in and took the oath of allegiance to the nation. One or two of the principals for whom high rewards are offered are not yet taken.From Port Maria we have received the disagreeable account of the loss of the ship Lion Capt. Smith belonging to Liverpool: a violent breeze on the 5th instant drove her from her anchors and she now lies stranded on the beach. ID345,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,05,24,entertain,NOOTKA SOUND.The circumstances of thetrade and situation of this part of North America being a matter of such general conversation and great public moment we are particularly happy in being enabled to give some further account of the transactions that have happened at Nootka Sounds as well as to point out the advantages that were likely to be extended to other places by the means of this trade.It is necessary to remark that the skin of the sea otter is worn only in the Northern regions of China. Its fur though beautiful and magnificent is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of the Southern Provinces.Pekin is therefore the proper mart for this valuable commodity and in this immense city the consumption is so great that the produce of the voyage meets and immediate sale.The Mandarins of the Court and even the Emperor himself are fond of wearing this costly fur. To a citizen of common rank a sea otter's collar to his vestment is a luxury.The natives of the North West Coast of Ameerica set so great a value on woollens of all kinds that all the blankets cloths hats and stockings that could be procured in China if English manufacture weresold to the Indians with whose Chiefs treaties of commerce had been formed.An act of cruelty committed by an officer of the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to be recorded.The Spaniards discovering that Callicum a Chief second in authority at Nootka Sound was in alliance with the English he was shot through the heart in the month of June 1789.?The wife of Callicum with an infant child escaped but not till wounded.Macquilla the Chief first in command retired at the head of the allies of England from Nootka Sound and to avoid the cruelty of the Spaniards they fled to distant parts. Such of the natives as they could seize the Spaniards condemned to work as slaves on their fortifications.At this period it was in the contemplation of the Spaniards to seize the Sandwich Islands with a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. And we further add on authority that amounts nearly to demonstration that on the very lands purchased from the Nootka Chief by Captain Mears the Spaniards have already opened valuable mines.Another object of this enterprise wasto supply the markets of Kamschatka and other ports belonging to the Russians with the teas and other produce of China. This promised to be an invaluable channel of commerce as the Chinese have shut their ports against the Russians whoOn this voyage of discovery and experiment one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo but was unfortunately lost on her return to China.To these curious particulars we add with a patriot joy that the consumption of the glorious staple of England her broad cloths is astonishingly great in Japan and China: British hard ware &c. is also in great request.From the friendship of Tiara to Captain Mears ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may depend on the utmost attention and civility. This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high of proportionate bulk. ID367,Glasgow Herald,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1822,01,28,inform,Extract of a letter from an Englishman dated Lima Septemper 10 1821Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colonial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; the whites are about 1200 Europeans and not as many born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty and misery than in any town of the size in the world.–There are some few splendid houses but the rest so disgustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being covered with dust and vermin. The streets as in all American towns run at right angles; a powerful stream of water in each; the town is capable of great improvement. The climate must be bad for the whole population look as if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of Peru we made the same observation; the ague very general with fever–their habits and manner of living increase the evil; thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold –I sleep under a heavy blanket and could bear another; a thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole not an oppressive climate if the people had any idea of living in a rational way. Very few families cook at home℃they buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets in pulperias and in the squares; not six families in Lima that have wine on their tables; they drink brandy at all hours and excuse themselves for not having any thing that is expensive by saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies himself a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in the evening. Their money goes in gambling debauchery and dress; every woman high and low has her price; a lady takes no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you she is quite at good as her neighbours and needs be no better. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause of all the degradation of South America; every Viceroy from Pizarro to Pezuela was a plunderer a teacher of immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it; scarcely a young lady can read or write or use a needle; few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a devout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves; as to priestcraft it reigns here in all its glory; a third part of Lima is covered with churches some of them very splendid. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns; if this is worked to advantage it will produce six millions of dollars; but if the country is disturbed by war not a dollar will they have. The exports of Peru in ordinary times were five millions of dollars in pecie and one million inproduce. Mininng may be carried to any extent it is true; but this requires tranquillity and good government. People in Europe have the most erroneous ideas or Peru; every traveller and historian who has written or talked about it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar.Arica the second port of Peru and the great outlet to Upper Peru is a wretched village of hovels covered with mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand bank–the people all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any sort. The harbour-master came off on bulsa (two bladders lashed together) paddled by an Indian. We could not get a basket of fruit or vegetablse for money. Their cultuvation was three leagues off but they were too lazy to fetch any thing though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to twnety hours offering them any price for their tropical fruits.I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month and sleep on the ground; borrowed a chair and bought some crockery. No such thing as a tavern; never was. Letters of no use; no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock to kill time. A play twice a week; the most fashionable ladies stand up in the front boxes and light a segar by the chandelier; the house filled with smoke.There are 82 titled families mostly idiots–all reduced to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war be continued a year Peru will be the most wretched country on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their empire and exterminate all other colours. the number of blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand–25000 in Lima and adjacent village the total population of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians.About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent and in the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the marketplace the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.–Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from Janja and other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore produce is continued to little vallies badly cultivated; those about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Carolina. Most valuable land a league from the town half cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved slaves; such famished objects I never beheld; no other hands to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general they will not work and famine must ensue.
