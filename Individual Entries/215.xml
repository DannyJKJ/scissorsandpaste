            <hi rend="italic">Swan River.</hi>â€“The ship Warrior, Stone,
                        command<lb break="no"/>er, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies,
                    <lb/>sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, <lb/>with prospects
                    of favourable weather in her progress <lb/>down the Channel. The Warrior is a
                    fine vessel of <lb/>about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250
                    <lb/>passengers to the new settlement. Several of the pas<lb break="no"/>sengers
                    are persons of independent fortune, who have <lb/>embarked considerable property
                    in the speculation ; and <lb/>and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the
                    <lb/>enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation <lb/>the vessel could
                    afford their families and suite. Six <lb/>pianos are on board the Warrior, and a
                    proportionate <lb/>number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians
                    <lb/>of course accompany the instruments to their destina<lb break="no"/>tion.
                    The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the <lb/>choicest breed, several
                    pens of sheep, considerable <lb/>number of swine, two milch cows, and three
                    valuable <lb/>horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be antici<lb break="no"/>pated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, appre<lb break="no"/>hensions
                    are entertained that a portion of the live cargo <lb/>must be consigned to the
                    ocean before the termination <lb/>of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the
                        advan<lb break="no"/>tageous arrangements entered into by the commander
                    <lb/>and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the <lb/>Warrior, and gone
                    out in her, they will clear the enor<lb break="no"/>mous sum of L10,000 by the
                    voyage.</p>
