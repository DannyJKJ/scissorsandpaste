            <hi rend="smallcaps">Conjugal
                    Love.</hi>
         </p>
                <p> On Monday last was married at Stockport, an <lb/>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to
                    a female on whom <lb/>he had fixed his <hi rend="italic">affections</hi>. It is
                    to be observed, <lb/>that he did not toil through the tedious forms of
                    <lb/>courtship, but at once got a wife, as others some<lb break="no"/>times get
                    good places, by <hi rend="italic">purchase</hi>–and, as we <lb/>are
                    informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas <lb/>and thirty yards of Irish
                    cloth, at 2s. 6d. per <lb/>yard–which property he deposited in exchange
                    <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">earthly treasure.</hi>–Whether a wife may be
                    <lb/>cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her <lb/>former husband,
                    having seen military service, was <lb/>not to be discomposed at <hi rend="italic">trifles</hi>, and his <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi>
            <lb/>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he
                    <lb/>attended the happy pair to church, and saw the <lb/>marriage ceremony ;
                    after which they spent the <lb/>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was
                    <lb/>gaity. The first husband parted with an help<lb break="no"/>mate had <hi rend="italic">borne his sorrows twelve years ;</hi> and <lb/>the second
                    husband received a <hi rend="italic">partner of his joys,</hi>
            <lb/>after having
                    buried a former one <hi rend="italic">just a week.</hi>
