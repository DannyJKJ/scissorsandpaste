            <pb/>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> of Sa<lb break="no"/>turday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which
                    <lb/>appeared in our paper on the excess of females over <lb/>males in the
                    census, which he assures us is entirely <lb/>owing to the lives of females being
                    prolonged by their <lb/>better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the ha<lb break="no"/>bit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom <lb/>we
                    were supposed by implication to be cut off perma<lb break="no"/>nently by
                    intemperance! We admit that a few hearty <lb/>fellows do go off in apoplexy; but
                    we deny that the <lb/>number bears any proportion to the amount supposed;
                    <lb/>we have two other remarks to make on his state<lb break="no"/>ment. First,
                    since our manners were corrupted by im<lb break="no"/>itating <hi rend="italic">English</hi> fashions, it is whispered, we hope un<lb break="no"/>, that
                    there are such things as tippling women in <lb/>country, some of whom do
                    disappear suddenly–no <lb/>matter how; and secondly, we wish our London
                    friend <lb/>inform us how it happens, that while all Broad <lb/>England has only
                    an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, <lb/>Edinburgh should have no less than
                    24! We under<lb break="no"/>stand that since this astounding fact was brought
                    out, <lb/>there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to <lb/>the
                    adjoining counties. We know a number who have <lb/>or are flying to Fife and the
                    north. A friend, who <lb/>careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of
                    <lb/>the Jews. The ladies, he says, attribute their flight to <lb/>
