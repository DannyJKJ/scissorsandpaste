            <hi rend="enlarged-capital">I</hi>T is shocking to describe the bloody scenes
                    that <lb/>have lately taken place in this district. The <lb/>Indians have killed
                    and scalped a great number of <lb/>persons, among whom is Colonel Isaac Bledose,
                    <lb/>who was massacred within 150 yards of his own <lb/>house.</p>
                <p>On the 27th instant a body of Indians attacked <lb/>Greenfield station: they
                    killed John Jervis, and <lb/>a negro fellow, belonging to Mrs. Tarker. By
                    <lb/>the bravery of three young men, viz. William Nee<lb break="no"/>ly, William
                    Wilson, and William Hall, the station <lb/>was preserved; they killed two
                    Indians, wounded <lb/>several others, and put them to flight. It is to be <lb/>
                    remembered, that Neely and Hall had each lost a <lb/>father and two brothers,
                    and Wilson a brother, by <lb/>the savages. Men are now in pursuit of the Indi<lb break="no"/>ans.</p>

                <p>About the 5th instant, a company of seven men <lb/>were attacked on the trace
                    from Cumberland to <lb/>Kentucky, near Big Barren, by a party of Indi<lb break="no"/>ans; three of the company were killed, and two <lb/>wounded.</p>

                    <lb/>Advices from our western frontiers mention, <lb/>that Major General Twiggs
                    crossed the Oconnee <lb/>with about 900 men, on Saturday last, on their <lb/>way
                    to the Cakmulgee, where the infantry were to <lb/>halt and build a fort. The
                    cavalry, amounting <lb/>to 450, commanded by Brigadier Generals Irwin,
                    <lb/>Clark, and Blackburn, were immediately to pro<lb break="no"/>ceed to the
                    lower Creek towns, and procure satis<lb break="no"/>faction for the numerous
                    unprovoked murders and <lb/>devastations lately committed by that faithless
                    tribe <lb/>of savages.</p>
                <p>Brigadier General Glascock, we are informed, <lb/>has received orders from the
                    Commander in Chief <lb/>to march to the frontiers in a few days, with one-
                    <lb/>third of his brigade, and part of the Augusta ar<lb break="no"/>tillery.
