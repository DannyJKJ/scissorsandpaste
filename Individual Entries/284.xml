            <hi rend="smallcaps">A Man Shot.</hi>–On Tuesday evening a deliverate
                    <lb/>attempt at murder by shooting took palce at Greenock. <lb/>A young man from
                    Edinburgh, an intended emigrant <lb/>for New South Wales, by the Palmyra, drew
                    from his <lb/>pocked a pistol, and shot in the head a person who had <lb/>been
                    appointed by his friends to see him on board, and <lb/>to look to his affairs
                    before the sailing of the vessel. <lb/>The wounded man was taken to the
                    Infirmary in a <lb/>very dangerous state, and the assailant to the jail. <lb/>It
                    appears that the young man has for some time past <lb/>been behaving in a manner
                    which made his friends <lb/>chary of intrusting him with money in this country,
                    <lb/>and that they had employed the individual referred to, <lb/>to see him on
                    board for Australia, before leaving any <lb/>under his charge. This indignity is
                    supposed to have <lb/>lain heavy on his mind, and led to the commission of
                    <lb/>the act above recorded.–<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
