            <hi rend="smallcaps">New Zealand Company</hi>
         </p>
                <p> A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<lb break="no"/>day, off the
                    West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, <lb/>by the preparation for departure of
                    three fine vessels <lb/>with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of
                    <lb/>New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and <lb/>several hundred persons
                    of rank and wealth met there <lb/>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants,
                    who ap<lb break="no"/>peared highly delighted with the honour extended to
                    <lb/>them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the <lb/>successful
                    result of their mission. After viewing the <lb/>arrangeents made for the comfort
                    of all on board, <lb/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern,
                    <lb/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large <lb/>room. The Duke
                    of Sussex took the chair, and was <lb/>supported on the right by the Earl of
                    Devon, and on <lb/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<lb break="no"/>
            <lb/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<lb break="no"/>ness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cot<lb break="no"/>tenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount <lb/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon.
                    Frederick Dundas, Hon. <lb/>Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P.,
                    <lb/>Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses <lb/>Young; the Hon. Mrs
                    Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, <lb/>Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine,
                    Sir Ro<lb break="no"/>bert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr,
                    <lb/>Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Ma<lb break="no"/>jesty's
                    Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wake<lb break="no"/>field, Dudley
                    Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain <lb/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c.
                    The rapid progress which the <lb/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand
                    has <lb/>made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal <lb/>Highness and
                    other distinguished speakers on both <lb/>sides of politics, and its many
                    advantages were dwelt <lb/>upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several
                        gentle<lb break="no"/>men of the first families go out with this expedition,
                    <lb/>which will be closely followed by several first-rate <lb/>ships. </p>
