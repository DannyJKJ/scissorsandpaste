            <hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade.–London, Thursday
                        Night.–</hi>
            <lb/>This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long
                    time <lb/>past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The <lb/>quantity
                    announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales, <lb/>consisting of about 100
                    bales of New South Wales <lb/>wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c.
                    The <lb/>New South Wales wool was first put up and went off <lb/>very briskly at
                    prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d <lb/>per lb., which quotations are
                    higher than those last <lb/>obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold
                    <lb/>by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company, being <lb/>a portion of the last
                    arrivals from the Company's flocks. <lb/>They met a very ready sale, and the
                    average prices ob<lb break="no"/>tained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The
                    arrivals <lb/>from Germany and other places this year are expected <lb/>to be
                    very great. </p>
