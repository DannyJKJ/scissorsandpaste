                </p>
                <p>"The convicts already arrived at this port <lb/>from Newfoundland, are near
                    fourscore in num<lb break="no"/>ber; a few others are expected. These unhap<lb break="no"/>py wretches are almost destitute of every sort of <lb/>covering,
                    and some of them are labouring under <lb/>sickness and infirmity. Their story is
                        accurate<lb break="no"/>as follows: About the middle of last June, <lb/>this
                    miserable class of beings, to the amount of <lb/>102 men and boys, and twelve
                    women, all of <lb/>whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, <lb/>on board
                    the Duke of Leinster transport, the <lb/>owners of which, who are Dublin
                    merchants, <lb/>contracted with the Government of Ireland for <lb/>carrying the
                    convicts to the North American <lb/>States.</p>
                <p>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, <lb/>part of which was foul weather,
                    the provision is <lb/>said to have fallen short ; the master of the trans<lb break="no"/>port, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for <lb/>Newfoundland
                    and lay-to till night; when he <lb/>disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little
                    distance <lb/>from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his des<lb break="no"/>perate freight.</p>
                <p>"To prevent this proceeding being too early <lb/>early known, he landed with them
                    provision for the <lb/>immediate supply of their wants, and bore away <lb/>with
                    a press of sail. The hungry victims lived <lb/>for three days in a state of
                    warfare, quarrelling <lb/>about their food ; the strongest beat the weak,
                    <lb/>and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there <lb/>was for a time as severe
                    fighting as if a kingdom <lb/>had been at stake.</p>
                <p>"They reached the town of St. John's on <lb/>the 20th of July ; and exhibited the
                    most appal<lb break="no"/>ing procession ever seen in that country : the in<lb break="no"/>habitants had immediate councils; and the mili<lb break="no"/>tary and navy co-operating, a place of security <lb/>was fixed upon at a
                    distance from the town, and <lb/>they were lodged ; here under a guard.</p>
                <p>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full <lb/>chorus, and the centinels were
                    frequently fright<lb break="no"/>ed with the noise while on their posts. A
                    battle <lb/>or two every half hour kept them festive all day; <lb/>and when the
                    provision supplied to them by the <lb/>inhabitants was lessening, they broke
                    away, and <lb/>laid hold of every thing that was eatable, with<lb break="no"/>out enquiring whether it had an owner.</p>
                <p>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious <lb/>to be received into the service of
                    the inhabitants <lb/>and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. <lb/>But
                    all of them have a claim to the charity of <lb/>this country for that supply of
                    raiment which is <lb/>necessary to guard them against the inclement
                    <lb/>weather."</p>
