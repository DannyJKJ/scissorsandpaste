            <pb n="6"/>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mile<lb break="no"/>end, received
                    the following letter from a friend <lb/>in Holland last week:</p>
                <p>"Sir, your friend Lâ€“y, who is just come here <lb/>from the East Indies,
                    desires me to inform you, <lb/>that your unfortunate relation who left you with
                    <lb/>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<lb break="no"/>bruary last.
                    He has settled at Port Jackson, and <lb/>has leave to teach the children of some
                    of your <lb/>nation to read and write in your own way. The <lb/>place is much
                    improved since you ahve had any <lb/>letters form it, as there was no person
                    without a <lb/>habitation, and being in some order, when he <lb/>left it. Except
                    wearing apparel, very little is <lb/>wanting but business ; but you may thank
                    the <lb/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought <lb/>several useful
                    things there. The last crops of <lb/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very
                    good <lb/>condition : and what makes the settlement more <lb/>convenient, one of
                    the people who came in the <lb/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for
                    use <lb/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that <lb/>of Delft or
                    elsewhere. He was surprised to see <lb/>so many people without hats or shoes,
                    and houses <lb/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush <lb/>furniture,
                    which is used in th eplace of almost <lb/>every thing else. If the smiths had a
                    plentiful <lb/>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would <lb/>be
                    wanting. Your nephew has two children, and <lb/>says all that are born there are
                    very healthy, and <lb/>more born than are buried or executed of grown
                    <lb/>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<lb break="no"/>ed before he
                    came away ; and he thinks if there <lb/>were enough of your people, they might
                    have a <lb/>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines <lb/>was seldom
                    visited by the savages ; and it was <lb/>reported when he came away, that as
                    soon as <lb/>more troops and a new Governor comes over, <lb/>they would go
                    farther than ever up the country, <lb/>when some valuable discovers are expected
                    to be <lb/>made ; they have a gum which may be used for <lb/>gum arabic, which
                    is veyr useful. He ex<lb break="no"/>pects several of your people will go from
                    Batavia <lb/>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way <lb/>for sending old
                    clothes is not yet found out. <lb/>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that
                    it is not <lb/>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<lb break="no"/>tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as <lb/>Europe, &amp;c.
                    &amp;c.</p>
