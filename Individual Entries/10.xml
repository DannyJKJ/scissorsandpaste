                    <lb/>

                </p>
                <p>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to <lb/>Decca, and arrived there after a
                    passage of 16 <lb/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, <lb/>and it was
                    really a shocking sight to behold; <lb/>you could not move out of your house but
                    the <lb/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and <lb/>jackalls were
                    eating them at noon-day. The <lb/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them
                    <lb/>to ashes, if they can afford it ; if not, throw <lb/>them into the river. I
                    have lately seen a man <lb/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<lb break="no"/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the <lb/>the tide
                    flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<lb break="no"/>man, or child, dies at
                    night, the corpse is eaten <lb/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<lb break="no"/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback <lb/>every
                    morning, I had an opportunity of seeing <lb/>more than those that did not. In
                    the course of <lb/>six months I became so much used to it, that I <lb/>took no
                    notice of it.</p>
                <p>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration <lb/>took place, and burnt upwards of
                    seven miles with<lb break="no"/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now
                    <lb/>consider, first, an inudation; second, a famine; <lb/>and third, a
                    conflagration. How much the place <lb/>must be distressed, I leave you to think.
                    I left <lb/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at <lb/>Calcutta, after
                    a passage through the Sunderburns <lb/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank
                    God."</p>
