            <hi rend="italic">Wool</hi>–The accounts received in Lond from New
                    <lb/>South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce <lb/>of the last
                    year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest <lb/>than that of the
                    preceding year, and the the quali<lb break="no"/>ty has also considerably
                    improved. From Van Die<lb break="no"/>man's Land it is now ascertained that the
                    supply this <lb/>year will be short, but the general quality is very supe<lb break="no"/>rior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large
                    <lb/>arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales <lb/>and the private
                    contract business is expected to be very <lb/>active. The public sales of wools
                    went off on Friday <lb/>very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week
                    <lb/>have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 <lb/>bales were Van
                    Dieman's Land wools, and the rest Ger<lb break="no"/>man. There is a steady
                    demand, and as it is under<lb break="no"/>stood that the manufacturers are short
                    of stock, the an<lb break="no"/>ticipations are that trade will son be greatly
                    improved.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">York Wool Market, May</hi> 23.–The market com<lb break="no"/>menced here for this season this day, with only a small
                    <lb/>show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders ask<lb break="no"/>ing very
                    high prices caused part to be left unsold. <lb/>The following are the prices ;
                    Hogs from 18s to 19s ; <lb/>Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to
                    <lb/>12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Bradford Market</hi>–The supply of Merinos in the
                    <lb/>markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal <lb/>to the
                    demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Me<lb break="no"/>rinoes were
                    eagerly bought up, and in some instances <lb/>a farther advance was obtained ;
                    three quarter wide <lb/>Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty sup<lb break="no"/>ply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from <lb/>4s
                    to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at <lb/>the beginning of the year,
                    and three quarter wide are <lb/>proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes
                    place <lb/>in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must <lb/>have a
                    further advance.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Rochdale Flannel Market.</hi>–The market today was
                    <lb/>very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both <lb/>for white and
                    for dyeing were of very ready sale, and <lb/>in some instances a little advance
                    was obtained ; several <lb/>sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the
                    demand <lb/>proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is <lb/>very
                    promising.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Liverpool Cotton Market.</hi>–There has been but a
                    <lb/>limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales <lb/>are only about
                    10,000 bugs, at declining prices.</p>
