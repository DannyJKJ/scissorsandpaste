            <hi rend="smallcaps">Mr Secretary Peel</hi>, in moving the commitment of the
                        Trans<lb break="no"/>
            <lb/>portation Bill, stated, that the objects of the
                    bill were, first, to <lb/>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire
                    before the <lb/>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last
                    session <lb/>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment
                    <lb/>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending
                    <lb/>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<lb break="no"/>cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it
                    <lb/>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<lb break="no"/>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a
                    great <lb/>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<lb break="no"/>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to
                    whom, <lb/>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<lb break="no"/>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South
                    <lb/>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<lb break="no"/>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection
                    <lb/>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment
                    <lb/>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.â€“
                    <lb/>He gave this statement because it was right the public should <lb/>know
                    that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment. </p>
