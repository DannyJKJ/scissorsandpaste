                <p>That the present Revolution in France is a con<lb break="no"/>sequence of the
                    Revolution in America, cannot <lb/>admit of a doubt. The American Revolution
                        o<lb break="no"/>riginated in Adams, a very insignificant Bosto<lb break="no"/>nian. Not that this Adams had the least expec<lb break="no"/>tation of American independence, when he fo<lb break="no"/>mented the
                    opposition to the stamp-act; indeed <lb/>no human wisdom could possibly have
                    foreseen <lb/>the subsequent folly and imprudence of the Bri<lb break="no"/>tish
                    administration and its obsequious Parliament. <lb/>An Administration so totally
                    destitute of common <lb/>sense, so totally ignorant of every princple of
                    <lb/>sound policy, no nation ever beheld. Adams had <lb/>the sagacity to avail
                    himself of such despicable <cb/>
            <lb/>policies.–Fortunately for the
                    American cause, <lb/>the Generals that were sent from England were <lb/>of
                    congenial abilities with the Minister, and the <lb/>Americans themselves were
                    surprised at the faci<lb break="no"/>lity with which they acquired their
                    independence. <lb/>–Yet all the blunders of the British administra<lb break="no"/>tion, and the miserable conduct of the British <lb/>Generals,
                    would hardly have been sufficient to <lb/>emancipate America, notwithstanding
                    her ex<lb break="no"/>treme weakeness, without the assistance of France;
                    <lb/>and this assistance depended entirely on Dr. <lb/>Franklin being driven to
                    Paris by the fatal-phi<lb break="no"/>lippic of a certain great lawyer. Such,
                    therefore, <lb/>is the chain of concurrent circumstances that hath
                    <lb/>overturned the French monarch. If the British <lb/>minister had possessed
                    common sagacity–if he <lb/>could have distinguished a general from a
                        corpo<lb break="no"/>ral; if Franklin had been treated with common
                    <lb/>civility, America would have remained a British <lb/>colony, and France an
                    absolute monarch, for <lb/>ages yet to come.</p>
