            <hi rend="italic">The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening.</hi>–The
                        follow<lb break="no"/>ing are more accurate averages of the sales of
                    Colonial Wools <lb/>which have recently taken place than we were enabled to
                        ob<lb break="no"/>tain during their progress.</p>
                <p>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The <lb/>Wools have become
                    much improved in growth, in length of <lb/>staple, in management, and in
                    washing. The market being <lb/>very bare in combining wool, this description
                    realized a propor<lb break="no"/>tionate advance. Several flocks attracted great
                    attention, <lb/>particularly those market T A in a square, I X and Y, <lb/>which
                    show that great pains have been paid by the growers <lb/>upon them. The correct
                    averages obtained are as follows :–</p>

                <p>The frist class of Van Diemen's Land Wool realised a consi<lb break="no"/>derable
                    rise upon last year's sales, the produce of the same <lb/>flocks then selling
                    only at 2s 2d to 2s 5d per lb.</p>
                <p>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have <lb/>been 2300 bales,
                    of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spa<lb break="no"/>nish, 300 New South
                    Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Tur<lb break="no"/>key, and 500 bales of South
                    American Woo's.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Huddersfield, Tuesday</hi>.–There has been no visible
                    change <lb/>in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks.
                    <lb/>Business in general is pretty good.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Bradford, June</hi> 30.–The activity we have so often
                    had to <lb/>report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six
                    <lb/>quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is par<lb break="no"/>ticularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the
                    <lb/>yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the bet<lb break="no"/>ter. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very <lb/>little
                    disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, <lb/>although the
                    demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers <lb/>are rather firmer. The
                    Liverpool sales of New South Wales <lb/>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the
                    recent London sales.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">Rochdale, June</hi> 27.–The market this week was very
                    well <lb/>attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much
                    <lb/>in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally <lb/>good at
                    present, and building is going on to a very considerale <lb/>extent.</p>
                <p>
            <hi rend="italic">York Wool Market, June</hi> 30.–The quantity of wool
                    brought <lb/>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last
                    <lb/>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a <lb/>considerable
                    portion of business was done, and last week's <lb/>quotations were fully
                    supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half <lb/>hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to
                    17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without <lb/>cots 10 1/2 to 11 1/2d ;
                    ditto with cots 11d to 12 1/2d per lb.</p>
