            <hi rend="smallcaps">Church in New South Wales.</hi>–Dr Gordon, as
                    <lb/>Convener of the committee to whom the dissensions <lb/>that at present
                    existed among the Presbyterian churches <lb/>in Australia had been remitted by
                    last Commission, stat<lb break="no"/>ed that the Committee had prepared a report
                    ; but <lb/>that since it was made up, several important documents <lb/>had come
                    to hand, which, in justice to Dr Lang, ought <lb/>to be considered. He therefore
                    asked leave to delay <lb/>the report, and to have the matter, with these docu<lb break="no"/>ments, recomitted to the committee.–This motion <lb/>was
                    agreed to, on the understanding that the question <lb/>would be again taken up
                    at the meeting of the Commis<lb break="no"/>sion on the 11th December. </p>
