                <p>Among the emigrants proceeding to seek ano<lb break="no"/>ther country on the
                    shores of Southern Africa, <lb/>four vessels, containing above 600 souls, have
                    <lb/>sailed from Liverpool, bound to the Cape of <lb/>Good Hope; three of them
                    under the command <lb/>and direction of a naval officer, and one under
                    <lb/>private superintendance. The public agent was <lb/>instructed to provide
                    every accomodation which <lb/>could minister to the health or comfort of the
                        fa<lb break="no"/>milies who were to embark</p>
                <p>Thursday afternoon, the brig Alexander <lb/>sailed from Greenock with emigrants
                    for Prince <lb/>Edward's island. This vessel had 85 pas<lb break="no"/>sengers
                    on board, of which 17 were children.</p>
                <p>On Friday the ship Alexander, Young, sailed <lb/>from Greenock for Quebec with 96
                    passengers.</p>
                <p>Extract of a letter, dated in Perth, Upper <lb/>Canada, 18th January –
                    "Liberty and Equality <lb/>are the predominant principles here. A common
                    <lb/>labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of <lb/>land. Whenever he finds
                    he can subsist upon <lb/>his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the
                    <lb/>township. Every settler, though ever so poor, <lb/>has a vote for the
                    member for the township, <lb/>and has full liberty to speak at every meeting.
                    <lb/>– It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow <lb/>weaver, who came
                    among us with scarce a stitch <lb/>to cover his nakedness, strutting between the
                    <lb/>stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh <lb/>Magistrate."</p>
