         <line>The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned </line>
         <line>at 62,000 souls, whilst her exports had never ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceeded two millions of <i>livres tournois</i> (about </line>
         <line>90,000l) The imports must have greatly ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of </line>
         <line>the differences can be formed. The present popula<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of the Canadas may be rated at 320,000 souls ; </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied </line>
         <line>from 120,000l. to 300,000l. chiefly of wheat, furs, </line>
         <line>and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they have </line>

         <line>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all </line>

            <i>Curious Anecdote</i>.–A few days ago a stranger </line>
         <line>waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East </line>
         <line>India Company, and desired to speak to him in </line>
         <line>private ; when the were retired, the stranger </line>
         <line>said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from </line>
         <line>India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of </line>
         <line>about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon </line>
         <line>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, </line>
         <line>"That he could receive no such money without </line>
         <line>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said </line>
         <line>the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ble. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. </line>
         <line>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege </line>

         <line>that deprives them of any part of the advantages </line>
         <line>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, </line>

         <line>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a </line>
         <line>letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum </line>
         <line>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid </line>

      <p>
         <line>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to </line>
         <line>Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 </line>
         <line>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, </line>
         <line>and it was really a shocking sight to behold; </line>
         <line>you could not move out of your house but the </line>
         <line>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and </line>
         <line>jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The </line>
         <line>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them </line>
         <line>to ashes, if they can afford it ; if not, throw </line>
         <line>them into the river. I have lately seen a man </line>
         <line>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>water mark before he was dead ; and when the </line>
         <line>the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>man, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten </line>
         <line>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback </line>
         <line>every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing </line>
         <line>more than those that did not. In the course of </line>
         <line>six months I became so much used to it, that I </line>
         <line>took no notice of it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration </line>
         <line>took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now </line>
         <line>consider, first, an inudation; second, a famine; </line>
         <line>and third, a conflagration. How much the place </line>
         <line>must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left </line>
         <line>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at </line>
         <line>Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns </line>
         <line>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."</line>

         <line>not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform </line>
         <line>our readers, that the United States are paying </line>
         <line>more attention to agriculture than to manufac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tures–They have already laid out four new </line>
         <line>States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. </line>
         <line>
            <i>Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, </i> and <i>The Western Ter</i>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>derness; they only began to settle it about the </line>
         <line>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in fo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid </line>
         <line>has been the population, that there are not less </line>
         <line>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, </line>
         <line>in each of these states. The State of Indiana </line>
         <line>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From </line>
         <line>a description of these four States, published in </line>
         <line>America in May last, we give our readers a </line>
         <line>short abridged description of the last of them, </line>
         <line>called <i>The Western Territory</i>; and it must re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and </line>
         <line>think, that the settling of these countries, though </line>
         <line>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or </line>
         <line>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sand acres of land, that being the present price </line>
         <line>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western </line>
         <line>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tures will continually increase with the increasing </line>
         <line>population of America.–Desponding politicians </line>
         <line>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new </line>
         <line>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<sh/>

            <enlarged_capital>O</enlarged_capital>N Saturday last between three and four </line>
         <line>o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent </line>
         <line>hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at </line>
         <line>a lost to determine its proper name) that was </line>
         <line>ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We </line>
         <line>can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that </line>
         <line>could be attended with more alarming circum<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stances. The cloud from the west, or rather a </line>
         <line>number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously </line>
         <line>agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– </line>
         <line>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind </line>
         <line>in some measure for what was to follow. The </line>
         <line>lightening appeared to those who were at a dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from </line>
         <line>the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick </line>
         <line>succession or some time, as to appear one sheet </line>
         <line>of flame. This might have had a great effect on </line>
         <line>the air, at some miles distance from town, to set </line>
         <line>it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down </line>
         <line>by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the </line>
         <line>earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; </line>
         <line>and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as </line>
         <line>thrown from buckets, and being carried along </line>
         <line>and dashed against every opposing object by a </line>
         <line>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a </line>
         <line>manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost </line>
         <line>in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole </line>
         <line>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the </line>
         <line>column of air move on: happily however, the da<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mages were much less than apprehended. The </line>

         </line>
         <line>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west </line>
         <line>end of the town, and lying directly in the line of </line>
         <line>march of this powerful column, was the first suf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ferer; all the parts of the building above the square </line>
         <line>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the </line>
         <line>roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which </line>
         <line>stood at a small distance on the east, striking it </line>
         <line>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and </line>
         <line>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is </line>
         <line>left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. </line>
         <line>After injruing some smaller buildings in its course </line>
         <line>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which </line>
         <line>it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church </line>
         <line>in the certain of town–a building of uncom<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand </line>
         <line>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bout a fourth part, however of the roof of the </line>
         <line>north side was carried off, with the weighty cor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred </line>
         <line>yards distance on the east side of the open square </line>
         <line>which is in the centre of this borough. After </line>
         <line>leaving the town it beat its course to the public </line>
         <line>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest </line>
         <line>the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, </line>
         <line>which were in the line of its direction, were also </line>
         <line>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what </line>
         <line>damages the farmers may have sustained we have </line>
         <line>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgot<sh/>

         <line>before they had taken their station as a guard, </line>
         <line>a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's </line>
         <line>house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. </line>
         <line>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalp<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– </line>
         <line>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the </line>
         <line>savages) with the rest of the men, made their </line>
         <line>escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's </line>

         <line>she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; </line>
         <line>but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was </line>

         <line>neighbouring plantation, where they are both </line>
         <line>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she </line>
         <line>wants to return to her own house.–The savages </line>
         <line>have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. </line>

         <line>Mr. Ephraim Daniel, of Baker's-row, Mile<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>end, received the following letter from a friend </line>
         <line>in Holland last week: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here </line>
         <line>from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, </line>
         <line>that your unfortunate relation who left you with </line>
         <line>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bruary last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and </line>
         <line>has leave to teach the children of some of your </line>
         <line>nation to read and write in your own way. The </line>
         <line>place is much improved since you ahve had any </line>
         <line>letters form it, as there was no person without a </line>
         <line>habitation, and being in some order, when he </line>
         <line>left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is </line>
         <line>wanting but business ; but you may thank the </line>
         <line>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought </line>
         <line>several useful things there. The last crops of </line>
         <line>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good </line>
         <line>condition : and what makes the settlement more </line>
         <line>convenient, one of the people who came in the </line>
         <line>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use </line>
         <line>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that </line>
         <line>of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see </line>
         <line>so many people without hats or shoes, and houses </line>
         <line>without windows, and full of wicker and rush </line>
         <line>furniture, which is used in th eplace of almost </line>
         <line>every thing else. If the smiths had a plentiful </line>
         <line>supply of coal and iron, hardly any utensils would </line>
         <line>be wanting. Your nephew has two children, and </line>
         <line>says all that are born there are very healthy, and </line>
         <line>more born than are buried or executed of grown </line>
         <line>people. The Christians Church was quite finish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed before he came away ; and he thinks if there </line>
         <line>were enough of your people, they might have a </line>
         <line>place to themselves. The farthest of the lines </line>
         <line>was seldom visited by the savages ; and it was </line>
         <line>reported when he came away, that as soon as </line>
         <line>more troops and a new Governor comes over, </line>
         <line>they would go farther than ever up the country, </line>
         <line>when some valuable discovers are expected to be </line>
         <line>made ; they have a gum which may be used for </line>
         <line>gum arabic, which is veyr useful. He ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pects several of your people will go from Batavia </line>
         <line>to settle there very soon ; and wonders a way </line>
         <line>for sending old clothes is not yet found out. </line>
         <line>Norfolk Island is os thinly inhabited, that it is not </line>
         <line>worth a stranger's while to land there ; and as lit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tle is said about it there, as if it was as far off as </line>
         <line>Europe, &amp;c. &amp;c. </line>

         <line>they were to be butchered indiscriminately, man </line>

            <small_caps>BOUT</small_caps> two month ago I went to the coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote </line>
         <line>county; and though I am much of what may be called "a <i> newspaper man</i>," I never
            thought of or<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To </line>
         <line>my utter astonishment, my <i>rustic</i> landlord did </line>
         <line>not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck </line>
         <line>down, with my friend in the country–knowing </line>
         <line>no more of what passed in town than if I had </line>
         <line>been in <i>Lapland</i>. Intending every day should be </line>
         <line>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any </line>
         <line>other paper, till two months had passed away, at </line>
         <line>which period I returned to town. And there, </line>
         <line>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had </line>
         <line>dropped down from the clouds. Every day I </line>
         <line>heard people talking of occurrences of which I </line>
         <line>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <i>Fish</i>
            <sh/>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>women</i> ; and battles in Flanders, against the </line>
         <line>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against </line>
         <line>the Turks. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>But even this was not the most distressing–for </line>
         <line>one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dially after his wife, who I found a few days af<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terwards, had eloped just before with another </line>
         <line>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed kindly for her sister, who I found had depart<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to the other world a fortnight before. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On this account I never will stir again "out of </line>
         <line>the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I </line>
         <line>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <i>viaticum</i> with </line>
         <line>which every man should be provided, and which be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>come the more necessary the further we remove </line>
         <line>from town It. is the only way to keep pace with </line>
         <line>what is going on every day in the fashionable or </line>
         <line>literary world–and to prevent talking about dead </line>
         <line>friends, or wives that have absconded. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <i>creed</i>–and ne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ver will I again travel without my faith along with </line>
         <line>me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness </line>

      <p>
         <line>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that </line>
         <line>sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman </line>
         <line>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all </line>
         <line>of which were said to be Europeans, were the </line>
         <line>founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew </line>
         <line>thousands of people after them, who pretended </line>
         <line>they were visited with power from on high to </line>
         <line>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast </line>
         <line>out devils, and speak in unknown languages. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part </line>
         <line>of the State of New York, where she began to </line>
         <line>instil her tenets into some of the people there:– </line>
         <line>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in </line>
         <line>New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the </line>
         <line>kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to </line>
         <line>the seculsion of all others. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>She pretended her mission was immediately from </line>
         <line>heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, </line>
         <line>–could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, </line>
         <line>in which she conversed with those that had de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>parted this life,–that there had not been a true </line>
         <line>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, </line>
         <line>until her's was erected,–that both the living and </line>
         <line>the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her </line>
         <line>–must confess their sins unto her, and procure </line>
         <line>her parson, or they could not be saved;–that </line>
         <line>that she gathered her church from both earth and </line>
         <line>hell, as every person that had died since the time </line>
         <line>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was </line>
         <line>damned, and that they were ocntinually making </line>
         <line>intercession to her for salvation, which was the </line>
         <line>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown </line>
         <line>tongues. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Those that entered into her church were ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>liged to confess their sins, and deliver up their </line>
         <line>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to </line>
         <line>be disposed of as she thought fit. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It has been reported that some of these confes<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sions proved very beneficial; for some of her </line>
         <line>church members owned they had stolen things that </line>
         <line>had been laid to innocent persons. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>When these people carry on their worship, they </line>
         <line>pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, </line>
         <line>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, </line>
         <line>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, </line>
         <line>groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are </line>
         <line>preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be </line>
         <line>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it </line>
         <line>may be heard at a great distance, and will often </line>
         <line>affrighten the spectators. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>They often dance three hours without inter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mission, and when any of them are tired of prais<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the Lord that way, they are whipped by o<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. </line>
         <column/>
         <line>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the </line>
         <line>young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or </line>
         <line>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, </line>
         <line>–if I may use the sailor's phrase. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, </line>
         <line>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain lan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>guage, and cry–<i>yea</i>, and <i>nay</i>, instead of <i>yes</i> and </line>
         <line>
            <i>no</i>: but the other Quakers do not approve of all </line>
         <line>their tenets. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>At particular times they labour very hard at </line>
         <line>their respective occupations, and are very careful </line>
         <line>that no time is spent in idleness. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>They pretend they hold a correspondence with </line>
         <line>the saints and angels, and that they frequently </line>
         <line>see and converse with the spirits of their departed </line>
         <line>friends. </line>
      </p>
      <p>

         <line>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the </line>

         <line>and were not defiled with women. </line>

      </p>

               <i>Martinique</i>, <i>Oct</i>. 6.</center>
         </line>
         <line>The disturbances in this island are so far from </line>
         <line>having abated, that they seem daily to gain ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ditional force. The French General, after the </line>
         <line>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>litary to his side, against the people : He began </line>
         <line>with subalterns, several of whom took a cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain oath of attachment which he administered to </line>
         <line>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficer declined, saying he had already engaged </line>
         <line>himself on the <i>side of the people</i>. Incensed at this </line>
         <line>reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, </line>
         <line>and at last laid his cane upon him ! </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, </line>
         <line>he made his next application to the regiment of </line>
         <line>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tioned there for the protection of the <i>people</i>, and </line>
         <line> for <i>them</i> only should be used. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested </line>
         <line>the sorry expedient of having recourse to the <i>peo</i>
            <sh/>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>ple</i> of <i>colour</i>, who <i>here</i> form a considerable corps. </line>
         <line>By a small dose of flattery these people, so rea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dily to be caught by a little seeming attention, </line>
         <line>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long </line>
         <line>as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till </line>
         <line>their fears for their own persons became an ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject of more weighty concern–they then aban<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>doned him. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>scended to this motley rabble, were truly disgust<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing. He embraced them; called them his <i>enfans</i>
         </line>
         <line>and <i>cher amis</i>, and practised all the dirty conde<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>scensions, which those only who are conversant in </line>
         <line>the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any </line>
         <line>conception of. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed </line>
         <line>to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>litary and the peopl–the consequence was, their </line>
         <line>doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty </line>
         <line>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into </line>
         <line>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding </line>
         <line>from the windows of his prison, him whom he had </line>
         <line>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike </line>
         <line>White, suspended on a gibbet. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled </line>
         <line>to confer on the measures to be taken on this oc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring </line>
         <line>the deposed Commander to that part of the island </line>
         <line>for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>side at that very important tribunal. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which </line>
         <line>time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de </line>
         <line>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary </line>
         <line>and ingenious method of being put between two </line>
         <line>planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw. </line>

         <line>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and </line>
         <line>from the multiplicity of business before them, </line>
         <line>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. </line>

         <line>of our new commercial arrangements. Among </line>

         </line>
         <line>avourable. o our own vessels, a preference is </line>
         <line>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and </line>
         <line>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our </line>
         <line>import and tonnage acts, every nation being on </line>
         <line>the same footing. With respect to the duties </line>
         <line>themselves, they could not be laid lower, consi<sh/>

         <line>dering the demand of supplies, which the Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mittee appointed to give in an estimate state at </line>
         <line>upwards of eight millions of dollars. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of </line>
         <line>improvement in politics and commerce, we </line>
         <line>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine </line>
         <line>wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expect<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of the fœderal government's acting with the </line>
         <line>energy and effect that will give it respectability. </line>
         <line>The prejudices and animosities created by the </line>
         <line>late contest are gradually dying away ; and to </line>
         <line>the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same </line>
         <line>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. </line>
         <line>A progress has also been made in manufactures </line>
         <line>of various kinds that was not expected ; and the </line>
         <line>persevering in them affords a strong presumption </line>
         <line>of those concerned deriving advantage. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Throughout the union, the public opinion </line>
         <line>on matters of government has of late experien<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated </line>
         <line>the absurdity of democracy, and the superior ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. </line>
         <line>His deductions from premises admitted as just, </line>
         <line>have abated much of the popular aversion to mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>narchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in </line>
         <line>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, </line>
         <line>were United America to have a sovereign ear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>in the next century. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion given general satisfaction, more than in their </line>
         <line>conduct towards the Indians. The interests of </line>

         <line>The Minister is now said to be employed in </line>
         <line>drawing up two plans, which will give rise to </line>
         <line>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tling a commercial arrangement between Great </line>
         <line>Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the </line>
         <line>Minister will have to contend with strong com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to </line>
         <line>encounter religious principles. The British </line>
         <line>settlers in Canada are comparatively few in num<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are the </line>
         <line>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lics. The former are Protestants. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, </line>
         <line>were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quests may be made by war, but consequence and </line>
         <line>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, </line>
         <line>if the first commercial nation in the world. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Besides these considerations, the grand secret </line>
         <line>has been discovered since the present Minister </line>
         <line>came into power, that the best riddance England </line>
         <line>ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because </line>
         <line>by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected </line>
         <line>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without </line>
         <line>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cans, at the same time that they cannot do with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out BRitish manufactures in one line or another. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing themselves, at the same time, that, like the </line>
         <line>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our </line>

         <line>The following phiosophical facts lead us to </line>
         <line>presume that the winter now setting in, will prove </line>
         <line>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that </line>
         <line>when this season commences early, and with se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>verity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern </line>
         <line>part of North America, it becomes extremely ri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. </line>
         <line>When, in the above climate, the winters have </line>
         <line>been severe, they have invariably been mild with </line>
         <line>us, and <i>vice versa</i>. Now, the ships which sailed </line>
         <line>from Newfoundland the beginning of October </line>
         <line>
            <i>last</i>, saw the hills already covered with snow. </line>
         <line>There is still another argument in favour of a mild </line>
         <line>winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a </line>
         <line>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always </line>
         <line>observed to have provided an uncommon store of </line>
         <line>wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller </line>
         <line>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet </line>
         <line>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to </line>
         <line>prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which </line>
         <line>they are accustomed to feed. The present sea<sh/>

         </line>
         <line>as follows: About the middle of last June, </line>

         <line>for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling </line>

         <line>tary and navy co-operating, a place of security </line>

         <line>I have always remarked that women, in all </line>
         <line>countries, are civil, obliging, tender, and humane; </line>
         <line>that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful, timorous and modest : and that they do not </line>
         <line>hesitate, like men, to perform a generous action. </line>
         <line>Not haughty, not arrogant, not supercilious, they </line>
         <line>are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more </line>
         <line>liable in general to err than man, but in general </line>
         <line>also more virtuous, and performing more good </line>
         <line>actions than he. To a woman, whether civiliz<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed or savage, I never addressed myself in the lan<sh/>

         <line>has been otherwise. </line>

         <line>was charmed to see a handsome person, who hav<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an </line>
         <line>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom </line>
         <line>he had fixed his <i>affections</i>. It is to be observed, </line>
         <line>that he did not toil through the tedious forms of </line>
         <line>courtship, but at once got a wife, as others some<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>times get good places, by <i>purchase</i>–and, as we </line>
         <line>are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas </line>
         <line>and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per </line>
         <line>yard–which property he deposited in exchange </line>
         <line>for <i>earthly treasure.</i>–Whether a wife may be </line>
         <line>cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her </line>
         <line>former husband, having seen military service, was </line>
         <line>not to be discomposed at <i>trifles</i>, and his <i>philosophy</i>
         </line>
         <line>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he </line>
         <line>attended the happy pair to church, and saw the </line>
         <line>marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the </line>
         <line>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was </line>
         <line>gaity. The first husband parted with an help<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mate had <i>borne his sorrows twelve years ;</i> and </line>
         <line>the second husband received a <i>partner of his joys,</i>
         </line>
         <line>after having buried a former one <i>just a week.</i>

         <line>On the 18th of June, 1692, the Hon. Mr. </line>
         <line>Boyle left by will the sum of 5400l. to be laid </line>
         <line>out in lands in Yorkshire, out of the rents of which </line>
         <line>the sum of 90l. was to be paid annually to the </line>
         <line>College of William and Mary, in New England, </line>
         <line>to be applied for the purpose of propagating the </line>
         <line>Christian religion amongst the Indians in the back </line>
         <line>settlements in North America ; and likewise a </line>
         <line>further sum of 45l. to be paid to the same College, </line>
         <line>for the support of two missionaries to preach the </line>
         <line>gospel. The city of London were left trustees, </line>
         <line>and the management under the trust was, by the </line>
         <line>will, committed to the care of the Bishop of Lon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>don. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in </line>
         <line>which the city, and a great number of other per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel </line>

         <line>or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be </line>
         <line>applied to similar purposes. This being the first </line>
         <line>determination of that nature since the American </line>
         <line>Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with </line>
         <line>that superior dignity of sentiment that always at<sh/>
         </line>

            <enlarged_capital>I</enlarged_capital>T is our wish, in imitation of other newswrit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ters, to give now and then an account of such </line>
         <line>new publications as deserve the attention of the </line>
         <line>public; but in a paper, pubished only twice a </line>
         <line>week, where so much naturally occurs under the </line>
         <line>article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can </line>
         <line>find room for this purpose:–when, however, a<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ny ting remarkable appears in the literary world, </line>
         <line>we never fail to notice it, although it may not be </line>
         <line>in our power to give an extensive and critical ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>count of its excellencies. We take up the pen </line>
         <line>with real pleasure at present to announce the pu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the </line>
         <line>reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this U<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>niversity. The great applause with which this </line>
         <line>play was received, when performed at Richmond </line>
         <line>Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who </line>
         <line>were not present at the performance to the high<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>est pitch; and we think we may take upon our<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>selves to assert, that upon perusing it, even their </line>
         <line>highest expetations will not be disappointed.– </line>
         <line>The plot of the piece is taken from a well known </line>
         <line>story published at the end of a volum of poems, </line>
         <line>written by the same gentleman. In the choice </line>
         <line>of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>spectable talents have erred, our author is peculiar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of </line>

         <line>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an </line>
         <line>appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form </line>
         <line>a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and </line>
         <line>Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and </line>
         <line>defeat of those arts, an end, which combin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed wake up a compleat and connected whole. In </line>
         <line>the delineation of character the author has, on al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>every occasion, attended to the "<i>quid quemque</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>decent</i>"–there are hoever some few parts, which </line>
         <line>the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so </line>
         <line>many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some lines, </line>
         <line>for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not </line>
         <line>strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much </line>
         <line>humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, </line>
         <line>as to prompt him to spare a victim, about to be </line>
         <line>destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; </line>
         <line>that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but </line>
         <line>a Briton, who has been fighting against his coun-</line>
         <line>trymen, amongst whom was his only son, whom </line>
         <line>he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much </line>
         <line>in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pleasing the village, and consequently of losing </line>
         <line>his power? Or is it likely that he would have </line>
         <line>greater influence with the superstitious crowd, </line>
         <line>than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his </line>
         <line>purpose the demons that sway the fortune of </line>
         <line>mankind?–Another question concenring O<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nonthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with </line>
         <line>the phlisophic firmness of the Sachem, so to de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>spair on receiving news of his son's death, as to </line>
         <line>declare that he should know no comfort, but to </line>
         <line>die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave </line>
         <line>Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most </line>
         <line>stood in need of his kind offices?–The first, and </line>
         <line>best supported character in the piece is that of </line>
         <line>Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat </line>
         <line>of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence </line>
         <line>of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her huma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nity, in intfering to save an unknown captive </line>
         <line>from death, are pleasing <missing>???</missing> which give <missing>???</missing>
         </line>
         <line>an insight into her nature. In the breast of Ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>riano every thing is subordinate to her love for </line>
         <line>Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is </line>
         <line>properly kept in view during the course of the </line>
         <line>piece. But even in this master-piece the author, </line>
         <line>has, perhaps, once deviated a little from nature. </line>
         <line>The sentiments Maraino utters during the con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>versation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather </line>
         <line>those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young </line>
         <line>creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to </line>
         <line>the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can </line>
         <line>she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, </line>
         <line>talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had </line>
         <line>so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, </line>
         <line>so entirely banish his imag from her mind, as to </line>
         <line>converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this </line>
         <line>one exception, the part of which we are speaking </line>
         <line>is finely drawn and highly intersting.–The lan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>guage of the piece is every where elegant, and in </line>
         <line>many places, where the sentiment requires it, </line>
         <line>sublime. The uathor has requently dignified his </line>
         <line>verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this </line>
         <line>in general produces a good effect–but there is a </line>
         <line>danger of using them too often, and of chusing </line>
         <line>them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult</line>
         <line>talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ticular passage of scene as deserving most notice: </line>
         <line>it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. </line>
         <line>If there is any preference to be given, it is per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>haps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo </line>
         <line>gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and </line>
         <line>the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompt<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves </line>
         <line>his innocence by the production of her husband's </line>
         <line>belt, the sight of which draws an elegant speech </line>
         <line>from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, </line>
         <line>would be improved did it conclude with some<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing more apt to the joyful moment, than the so<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in </line>
         <line>itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, </line>
         <line>
            <center>
               <i>Sed nunc non erat his locus.–</i>
            </center>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we </line>
         <line>have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is </line>
         <line>in our opinion far superior to most of those plays </line>
         <line>which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid </line>
         <line>of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevita<sh/>

         <line>mit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. </line>
         <line>They have set fire to several houses; and a wo<sh/>

         <line>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse</line>
         <line>which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the</line>
         <line>whole of them off. In a second engagement, they</line>
         <line>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as</line>
         <line>many. On account of which, Sinclair thought</line>
         <line>proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the</line>
         <line>Indians having divided themselves into small par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to</line>
         <line>leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his</line>
         <line>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said</line>
         <line>the Indians are very much elated at their success,</line>
         <line>and that numbers were daily joining them, at</line>
         <line>their head quarters, about the Maimis towns–</line>
         <line>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own</line>

      <p>
         <line>"The Indians were extremely civil to the</line>

         <line>CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. </line>
         <line>The following account of the inhabitants of this </line>
         <line>settlement is given by a late traveller. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The education of youth has hitherto been very </line>
         <line>much neglected: the government never hit upon any </line>
         <line>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; </line>
         <column/>
         <line>and the individual had no other ambition but that of </line>
         <line>qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>come servants of the Company. This body of mer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chants had a number of persons in their employ, </line>
         <line>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were </line>
         <line>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the </line>
         <line>consequence of such a conduct was, that each be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>came a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little pri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vate shop in some corner of his house. The most pal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try articles were in the list of their commodities for </line>
         <line>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, </line>
         <line>and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to </line>
         <line>their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the </line>
         <line>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but </line>
         <line>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds </line>
         <line>of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, </line>
         <line>and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, </line>
         <line>were wholly bent on trade. <i>Knopman</i>, or merchant, </line>
         <line>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which </line>
         <line>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas </line>
         <line>of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nese, who have degraded the merchant into the </line>
         <line>very lowest order of their society. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>That portion of the day, not employed in the </line>
         <line>concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the grati<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste </line>
         <line>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine </line>
         <line>arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, </line>
         <line>except occasional balls ; nor is there much social </line>
         <line>intercourse but by family parties; which usually </line>
         <line>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ters and merchandize engross their whole conver<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy </line>
         <line>circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole </line>
         <line>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the </line>
         <line>interest of a fund established out of the church su<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perfluities, from alms, donations, and collections, </line>
         <line>made after divine service, and not from any tax laid </line>
         <line>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial </line>
         <line>assessments for the repairs of the streets and public </line>
         <line>works, the inhabitants of the Cape have little </line>
         <line>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their </line>
         <line>labour. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It has been the remark of most travellers, that </line>
         <line>the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good </line>
         <line>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic tem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners </line>
         <line>and appearance of the young men and the young </line>
         <line>women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. </line>
         <line>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in </line>
         <line>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; </line>
         <line>whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate </line>
         <line>form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected </line>
         <line>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; </line>
         <line>an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained </line>
         <line>by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to </line>
         <line>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on, </line>
         <line>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else </line>
         <line>where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; </line>
         <line>but all the children, male and female, share alike </line>
         <line>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a </line>
         <line>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of </line>
         <line>the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian </line>
         <line>Code. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>By the law of the colony, a community of all </line>
         <line>property, both real and personal, is supposed to take </line>
         <line>place on the marriage of two person unless the </line>
         <line>contrary should be particularly provided against by </line>
         <line>solemn contract made before marriage. Where no </line>
         <line>such contract exists, the children, on the death of </line>
         <line>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint </line>
         <line>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceased, and which cannot be withheld on applica<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion after they are come of age. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape </line>
         <line>to r emark, that many of them have profited much </line>
         <line>more than could be expected from the limited </line>
         <line>means of education that the place affords. In the </line>
         <line>better families, most of them are taught music, and </line>
         <line>some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. </line>
         <line>Many understand the French language, and some </line>
         <line>have made great proficiency in the English. They </line>
         <pg n="4"/>
         <column/>
         <line>are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knot<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ting, and tambour work, and in general make up </line>
         <line>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion </line>
         <line>of England brought from time to time by the female </line>
         <line>passengers bound to India, from whom they may </line>
         <line>be said to </line>
         <line>
            <center>"Catch the manners living as they rise"</center>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient </line>
         <line>in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of </line>
         <line>a proper education, to open their minds, and excite </line>
         <line>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], </line>
         <line>and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate </line>
         <line>with the English, except such as hold employments </line>
         <line>under the Government. This backwardness may </line>
         <line>be said to be owing in part to the different habits of </line>
         <line>the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tance that a vanquished people must always feel in </line>
         <line>mixing with their conquerors. </line>

            <enlarged_capital>I</enlarged_capital>T is some abatement of the statisfaction, with </line>
         <line>which I meet you on the present occasion, </line>
         <line>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the </line>
         <line>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to </line>
         <line>add to it information that the Indian hostitilites, </line>
         <line>which have for some time past, distressed our </line>
         <line>western frontier, have terminiated: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>You will, I am persuaded, loearn, with no less </line>
         <line>concern, than I communicate it, that reiterated </line>
         <line>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have </line>
         <line>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs </line>
         <line>of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes </line>
         <line>with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire </line>
         <line>to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop </line>
         <line>the further effusion of blood–to arrest the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of </line>
         <line>the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, </line>
         <line>through various channels, to accomplish these de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sirable purposes:–In making which efforts, I </line>
         <line>consulted less my own anticipations of the event, </line>
         <line>or the scruples which some considerations were </line>
         <line>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, that </line>
         <line>such is the case. </line>

      <p>
         <line>A detail of the measures which have been pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sued, and of their consequences, which will be </line>
         <line>laid before you, while it will confirm to you the </line>
         <line>want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince </line>
         <line>that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could </line>
         <line>have been devised have been employed. The </line>
         <line>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; </line>
         <line>but a favorable one, though not to be despaired </line>
         <line>of, is not promised by anything that has yet hap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pened. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the course of the attempts, which have been </line>
         <line>made some valuable citizens have fallen victims </line>
         <line>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction </line>
         <line>commonly respected, even among savages, has been </line>
         <line>found, in this instance, insufficient to protect </line>
         <line>from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will, I </line>
         <column/>
         <line>presume, be duly considered whether the occasion </line>
         <line>does not call for an exercise of liberality towards </line>
         <line>the families of the deceased. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It must add to your concern, to be informed </line>
         <line>that besides the continuation of hostile appearances </line>
         <line>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ening symptoms have of late been revived among </line>
         <line>some of those south of it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name </line>
         <line>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the </line>
         <line>Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of </line>
         <line>committing depredations on the neighbouring </line>
         <line>settlements. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made </line>
         <line>with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791, would </line>
         <line>have prevented a repetition of such depredations. </line>
         <line>But the event has not answered this hope. The </line>
         <line>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another </line>
         <line>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated </line>
         <line>wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the ci<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tizens of the United States in that quarter. The </line>
         <line>information which has been received on this sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cautions only have been enjoined and observed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is not understood that any breach of treaty </line>
         <line>or aggression whatsoever, on the part of the Uni<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ted States or their citizens, is even alleged, as </line>
         <line>a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>I have reason to believe, that every practicable </line>
         <line>exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision </line>
         <line>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for </line>
         <line>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the </line>
         <line>event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large </line>
         <line>proportion of the troops authorized to be raised </line>
         <line>have been recruited, though the number is still </line>
         <line>incomplete, and pains have been taken to disci<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pline and put them in condition for the particu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of </line>
         <line>operations (besides being dictated by the measures </line>
         <line>which were pursuing towards a pacific termina<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of the war) has been in itself deemed prefe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the </line>
         <line>proper department, with regard to the number </line>
         <line> of troops raised, and some other points which </line>
         <line>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations </line>
         <line>and among other things, will enable Congress to </line>
         <line>judge whether some additional stimulus to the re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cruiting service may not be advisable. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In looking forward to the future expense of </line>
         <line>the operations which may be found inevitable, I </line>
         <line>derive consolation from the information I receive </line>
         <line>that the product of the revenues for the present </line>
         <line>year, is likely to supersede the necessity of addi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tional burthens on the community, for the service </line>
         <line>of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it </line>
         <line>is proper to add, that the information alluded to </line>
         <line>proceeds upon the supposition of no material ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tension of the spirit of hostilities. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, </line>
         <line>without again recommending to your considera<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion the expediency of more adequate provision </line>
         <line>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terior frontier; and for restraining the commission </line>
         <line>of outrages upon the Indians; without which all </line>
         <line>pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by </line>
         <line>competent rewards, the employment of qualified </line>
         <line>and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, </line>
         <line>would also contribute to the preservation of peace </line>
         <line>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these </line>
         <line>expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for </line>
         <line>promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, </line>
         <line>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale </line>
         <line>equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lated to protect them from imposition and extor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, its influence in cementing their interest </line>
         <line>with ours could not but be considerable. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The prosperous state of our revenue has been </line>
         <line>intimated–This would be still more the case, </line>
         <line>were it not for the impediments which in some </line>
         <column/>
         <line>places continue to embarrass the collection of the </line>
         <line>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States. </line>
         <line>These impediments have lessened, and are lessened </line>
         <line>in local extent; and as applied to the community </line>
         <line>at large, the contentment with the law appears </line>
         <line>to be progressive. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>But symptoms of increased opposition having </line>
         <line>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters, </line>
         <line>I judged a special interposition on my part, proper </line>
         <line>and advisable, and under this impression have </line>
         <line>issued a proclamation warning against all unlaw<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful combinations and proceedings, having for their </line>
         <line>object or tending to obstruct the operation of </line>
         <line>the law in question, and announcing that all law<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful ways and means would be strictly put in exe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cution for bringing to justice the infractors there<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>of and securing obedience thereto. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured </line>
         <line>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits </line>
         <line>which may depend upon me, shall be wanting to as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sert and maintain the just authority of the laws. </line>
         <line>In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon </line>
         <line>the full cooperation of the other departments of </line>
         <line>the Government and upon the zealous support of </line>
         <line>all good citizens. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>I can not forbear to bring again into the view </line>
         <line>of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the </line>
         <line>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences </line>
         <line>that are experienced. In the course of the execu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of the laws considerations rise out of the </line>
         <line>structure of the system, which in some cases, tend </line>
         <line>to relax their efficacy. As connected with this </line>
         <line>subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail </line>
         <line>upon processes out of the courts of the United </line>
         <line>States, and a supplementary definition of offenses </line>
         <line>against the constitution and laws of the union, and </line>
         <line>of the punishment for such offenses will, it is pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sumed, be found worthy of particular attention. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Observations on the value of peace with other </line>
         <line>nations are unnecessary. It would be wise, how<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever, by timely provisions to guard against those </line>
         <line>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turb it, and to put ourselves in a condition to </line>
         <line>give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which we </line>
         <line>may sometimes have occasion to require from them. </line>
         <line>I particularly recommend to your consideration of </line>
         <line>the means of preventing those aggressions by our </line>
         <line>citizens on the territory of other nations, and </line>
         <line>other infractions of the law of nations, which </line>
         <line>furnishes just subject of complaint, might endan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ger our peace with them. And, in general, the </line>
         <line>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign </line>
         <line>powers will be presented to your attention by the </line>
         <line>expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes </line>
         <line>place, if not renewed, at the close of the present </line>
         <line>session. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In execution of the authority given by the le<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gislature, measures have been taken for engaging </line>
         <line>some artists from abroad to aid in the establish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of our mint; others have been employed at </line>
         <line>home. Provision has been made of the requisite </line>
         <line>buildings, and these are now putting into proper </line>
         <line>condition for the purposes of the establishment. </line>
         <line>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>age of half dimes, the want of small coins in cir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culation calling the first attention to them. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The regulation of foreign coins in correspon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dency with the principles of our national coinage, </line>
         <line>as being essential to their due operation, and to </line>
         <line>order in our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be </line>
         <line>resumed and completed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is represented that some provisions in the </line>
         <line>law, which establishes the Post-Office, operate, </line>
         <line>in experiment, against the transmission of news<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>papers to distant parts of the country.–Should </line>
         <line>this, upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact, </line>
         <line>a full conviction of the importance of facilitating </line>

      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The adoption of a constitution for the state of </line>
         <line>Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legis<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>arises from an event interesting to the happiness </line>
         <line>of the part of the nation to which it relates, and </line>
         <line>conducive to the general order. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since </line>
         <line>my last communication on the subject, and in </line>
         <line>further execution of the acts, severally making </line>
         <line>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion thereof, three new loans have been effected, </line>
         <line>each for three millions of florins,–one at Ant<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>werp, at the annual interest of four and one-half </line>
         <line>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in </line>
         <line>lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans, and </line>
         <line>the circumstances under which they have been </line>
         <line>made are confirmations of the high state of our </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Among the objects to which these funds have </line>

         <line>were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut </line>

         <line>the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. </line>

         <line>with very deep water, wherever he attempted to </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A very melancholy accident happened at a place </line>
         <line>called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the bag<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping </line>
         <line>there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging </line>
         <line>to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and </line>
         <line>was climbing on the wheel, when the horses sudden<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>going off, threw him on the ground, and the </line>
         <line>wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. </line>
         <line>The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this </line>
         <line>unhappy accident happened. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, </line>
         <line>Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds </line>
         <line>in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings </line>
         <line>of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a poc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; </line>
         <line>some partial payments are marked on the bills. The </line>
         <line>villians appear to have entered the shop by forcing </line>
         <line>up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then </line>
         <line>breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron </line>
         <line>bolts and the window opened. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On Sturday last, a porter was killed in the hold </line>
         <line>of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged </line>
         <line>unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pul<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly was supported, giving way, the measure fell down </line>
         <line>upon him, and killed him instantly. </line>

         <line>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Steven<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>son, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at </line>
         <line>Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The </line>
         <line>match unfortunately communicated too early to the </line>
         <line>powder, and the explosion took place before he </line>
         <line>could get out of the way. He has left a wife and </line>
         <line>two children to lament his loss. </line>

         <line>They apprehended four with some opposition ; and </line>
         <line>on their way to town with them, they were follow<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by a considerable number of persons who rescued </line>
         <line>one prisoner, and threatened that they would next </line>
         <line>day proceed to the depot at Lapraire, and bring </line>
         <line>away by force from thence the young men of the </line>
         <line>parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on </line>
         <line>Wednesday, a large body of these people assembled </line>
         <line>at La Chine, with the intention of carrying their </line>
         <line>threats into execution. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>strates, about four o'clock in the afternoon, left town, </line>
         <line>accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with </line>
         <line>two field-pieces, under the command of Major </line>
         <line>Plenderleath, and took post on a point opposite to </line>
         <line>the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons, 87 </line>
         <line>of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] </line>
         <line>of about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other </line>
         <line>respectable citizens, pointed out the impropriety of </line>
         <line>their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately </line>
         <line>await their perseverance ; urging them, by every per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>suasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses </line>
         <line>and obey the law. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>They replied, that they did not consider the mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>litia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it </line>
         <line>had not received the Royal sanction ; and that al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>though it might have passed the House of Assem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bly, where it originated, it had not obtained the ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>probation of the other branches of the Legislate ; </line>
         <line>that the law, if really enacted, had not been proma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gated amongst them, and that they were not properly </line>
         <line>made acquainted with it ; as such, they could not </line>
         <line>pay obedience to it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Under this false and unfortunate impression, these </line>
         <line>deluded people persisted ; but at the same time de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>clared, with shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i> that if the Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment wanted their services at any time, they were </line>
         <line>ready, one and all, to come forward with their lives </line>
         <line>in the defence of their country, and that they would </line>
         <line>prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful </line>
         <line>subjects to a Government to which they were firmly </line>
         <line>attached by every principle. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Finding, however, that they still persisted in their </line>
         <line>determination on this particular object, Mr M'Cord, </line>
         <line>in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot act to them </line>
         <line>and ordered them to disperse ; which not being com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, </line>
         <line>but elevated above injury, which was returned by the </line>
         <line>insurgents in a spirited fire with ball, deserving of a </line>
         <line>better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball </line>
         <line>and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm </line>
         <line>which was also returned by another discharge from </line>
         <line>the mob, upon which a few direct shots were fired </line>
         <line>at them (it being nearly dark) by the military, which </line>
         <line>made them disperse, and one man was found killed </line>
         <line>and another wounded, it is feared mortally. </line>

      <p>
         <line>Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac </line>
         <line>Brock, Esq. administering the Government of Up<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>per Canada, and Major-General, commanding his </line>
         <line>Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from </line>
         <line>Fort-George, and accompanied by a numerous suite </line>
         <line>proceeded to the Government Building at four <small_caps>p.m.</small_caps>
         </line>
         <line>when he opened the present extra session of the Le<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gislature, and delivered the following speech to both </line>
         <line>houses :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council </line>
         <line>and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The urgency of the present crisis is the only considera<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion which would have induced me to call you together, at a </line>
         <line>time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand </line>
         <line>your care and attention. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose </line>
         <line>avowed object is the entire conquest of this province, the </line>
         <line>voice of loyalty, as well as of interest, calls aloud to every </line>
         <line>person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend his </line>
         <line>country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; </line>
         <line>they have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their </line>
         <line>conduct, that they are worthy of the King whom they serve </line>
         <line>and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me </line>
         <line>particulary satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legisla<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tors, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be </line>
         <line>ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their </line>
         <line>arms. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the </line>
         <line>regular forces, for our protection ; but I should be wanting to </line>
         <line>that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to </line>
         <line>conceal (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, </line>
         <line>especially of legislators, has discovered) that amendment </line>
         <line>in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is </line>
         <line>for you to consider what further improvements they still may </line>
         <line>require. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, </line>
         <line>and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"From the history and experience of our mother country, </line>
         <line>we learn, that in times of actual invasion or interal commo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in </line>
         <line>adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private </line>
         <line>treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such </line>
         <line>times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>straining, for a limited period, the liberty of individuals, in </line>
         <line>many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the parti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the </line>
         <line>province might justify me in the exercise of the full power re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agree<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>able to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been </line>
         <line>suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have </line>
         <line>been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general </line>
         <line>spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of </line>
         <line>this province, is such as to authorise a just expectation that </line>
         <line>their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– </line>
         <line>The disaffected, I am convinced, are few–To protect and </line>
         <line>defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject worthy of your most serious deliberations."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The speech concludes with a call for supplies. </line>

         <line>Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has </line>
         <line>been followed by the actual invasion of this province </line>
         <line>in a remote frontier of the western disticts, by a </line>
         <line>detachment of the United States. The officer com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>manding that detachment has thought proper to in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and </line>
         <line>unresisting submission, but insults them with a call </line>
         <line>to seek voluntarily the protection of his Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal </line>
         <line>epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American </line>
         <line>Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the </line>
         <line>administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of </line>
         <line>the province is desired to seek the confutation of </line>
         <line>such indecent slander in the review of his own par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ticular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has </line>
         <line>been injured by the Government in his person, his </line>
         <line>property, or his liberty? Where is to be found, in </line>
         <line>any part of the world, a growth so paid in pros<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled </line>
         <line>not thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from </line>
         <line>their former possessions on account of their loyalty, </line>
         <line>not a descendant of these brave people it to be found, </line>
         <line>who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, </line>
         <line>has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment, </line>
         <line>superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. </line>
         <line>This unequalled prosperity would not have been at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tained by the utmost liberality of the Government, </line>
         <line>or the persevering industry of the people, had not </line>
         <line>the maritime power of the mother country secured </line>
         <line>to its colonists a safe access to every market where </line>
         <line>the produce of their labour was in request. The </line>
         <line>unavoidable and immediate consequence of a sepa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ration from Great Britain, must be the loss of this </line>
         <line>inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in </line>
         <line>exchange? To become a territory of the United </line>
         <line>States, and share with them that exclusion from the </line>
         <line>ocean which the policy of their Government en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forces ; you are not even flattered with a participa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of their boasted independence ; and it is but </line>
         <line>too obvious, that once exchanged from the power<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful protection of the United Kingdom, you must be </line>
         <line>re-annexed to the dominion of France, from which </line>
         <line>the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms </line>
         <line>of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and </line>
         <line>treasure, from no other motive than to relieve her </line>
         <line>ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel </line>
         <line>neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire </line>
         <line>of France, was the stipulated reward for the aid af<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forded to the revolted colonies, now the United </line>
         <line>States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no </line>
         <line>doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deration for commercial advantages, or rather for an </line>
         <line>expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over </line>
         <line>the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or </line>
         <line>rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of </line>
         <line>Europe with a rod of iron? If not, arise in a body, </line>
         <line>exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the </line>

         <line>not give cause to your children, when groaning </line>
         <line>under the oppression of a foreign master, to reproach </line>
         <line>you with having too easily parted with the richest in<sh/>

         <line>"Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New </line>
         <line>York a few days ago. On his way he passed three </line>
         <line>days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the Ame<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rican army, which, from ocular observation, he states </line>
         <line>to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command </line>
         <line>of Gneeral Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This </line>
         <line>force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the </line>
         <line>same number of militia, and some colunteers from the </line>
         <line>southward. The militia is almost all from the state </line>
         <line>of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. </line>
         <line>with this force no doubt is entertained here but they </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line>will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it </line>
         <line>this season, they must be prompt in their movements, </line>
         <line>for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well </line>
         <line>clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states </line>
         <line>half of them to be without shoes or stockings, </line>
         <line>which will never do for a winter campaign in this </line>
         <line>country. To repel the threatened attack, we are </line>
         <line>making every preparation in our power, and the Ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nadians seem well disposed to secondthe Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, </line>
         <line>the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to </line>
         <line>Chaneguny[?] ; the main encampment is half way be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tween St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray </line>
         <line>is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-au<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> Noix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain </line>
         <line>secured across the river. This line of defence is </line>
         <line>composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 </line>
         <line>chained[?] militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian </line>
         <line>voyageurs[?], raised last spring. The Royals, a very </line>
         <line>[?] battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, </line>
         <line>are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, </line>
         <line>[?] here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do </line>
         <line>garrison : indeed there are in this island </line>
         <line>(Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to </line>
         <line>4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an </line>
         <line>alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– </line>
         <line>A new regiment of embodied militia has late<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly been formed by drafts from the different regi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major </line>
         <line>Murray is appointed Liuetenant-Colonel. The gen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlemen of the North-west Company army are forming </line>
         <line>a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful </line>
         <line>troops to act in advance with the Indians. The </line>
         <line>number originally proposed was 200, but the men </line>
         <line>have come forward so handsomely, that they are to </line>
         <line>consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, </line>
         <line>and the other partners of the Company are Captains </line>
         <line>and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded </line>
         <line>by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may </line>
         <line>be considered as already disciplined, at least in point </line>
         <line>of subordination. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Sir George confines his operations to mere de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced </line>
         <line>through the woods, about ten days ago, within hear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop, </line>
         <line>which so completely terrified them that though they </line>
         <line>could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two </line>
         <line>two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to </line>
         <line>prevent which, they cut down their best bridge, and </line>
         <line>destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean </line>
         <line>to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at </line>
         <line>their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of </line>
         <line>Liutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 </line>
         <line>men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his </line>
         <line>plan was fixed, not to make any attack nor to send a </line>
         <line>man across the line. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to </line>
         <line>fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent </line>
         <line>swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be </line>

         <line>Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, </line>
         <line>gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron </line>
         <line>stood for them, on which immediately bore away </line>
         <line>from us under as much sail as their schooners could </line>
         <line>carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's </line>
         <line>fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, </line>

         <line>windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our </line>

         <line>squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, </line>
         <line>when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their </line>
         <line>going so fast, it was more than an hour before the </line>
         <line>Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at </line>
         <line>this time the rest of the squadron was two and </line>
         <line>three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming </line>
         <line>up with the Madison and Pike, they put before </line>
         <line>the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– </line>

         <line>Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, </line>
         <line>of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the </line>
         <line>night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board </line>
         <line>perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and </line>
         <line>capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 </line>

         <line>tained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, </line>
         <line>and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, </line>
         <line>and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on </line>

      <p>
         <line>By accounts from the army under Major-General </line>
         <line>De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following </line>
         <line>particulars have been received of a bold and success<sh/>

         <line>ful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort </line>
         <line>Schlosser. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting </line>
         <line>of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th </line>
         <line>regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four </line>
         <line>of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieu<sh/>

         <line>they made prisoners, together with three civilians </line>
         <line>and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– </line>
         <line>The party remained in the Fort about one hour, </line>
         <line>loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, </line>
         <line>and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 </line>
         <line>stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket ball </line>
         <line>cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for </line>

         <line>one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, </line>

         <line>collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, </line>
         <line>and several shots were fired, but the boats returned </line>
         <line>to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles </line>
         <line>they had captured, without a man being hurt on this </line>

         <line>from the army highly creditable to the Indian war<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>riors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party </line>
         <line>of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian war<sh/>

         <line>riors were sent to endeavour to recover a consider<sh/>

         <line>able quantity of medicines and surgical instruments </line>
         <line>which had been buried near the Fort George when </line>

         <line>in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men kil<sh/>

         <line>led and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medi<sh/>

         <line>under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bishopp. </line>
         <line>The enemy's position was carried by a spirited at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tack without the loss of a single man. Several large </line>
         <line>boats, loaded with stores and provisions, and three </line>

      <p>
         <line>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North </line>
         <line>America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, </line>
         <line>concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, </line>
         <line>[?] [?] on the 6th of October, by the American </line>
         <line>army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the </line>
         <line>invasion[?] of that province, after the capture of the little fleet </line>
         <line>on Lake Erle, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the </line>
         <line>[?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for </line>
         <line>our[?] sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Chris<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans, it was </line>
         <line>his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation </line>
         <line>should retreat[?] farther into the country. When the Americans </line>
         <line>were successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps </line>
         <line>of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, </line>
         <line>and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>feat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans first </line>
         <line>pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, </line>
         <line>who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Mission<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>aries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Mis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sionary, Michael Young, remained. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"During the first night the Americans already changed </line>
         <line>their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began </line>
         <line>to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults, </line>
         <line>plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that </line>
         <line>was exable[?] away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores </line>
         <line>and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every </line>
         <line>place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>modore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the </line>
         <line>lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. </line>
         <line>They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans </line>
         <line>set the place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every </line>
         <line>outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, </line>
         <line>and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsyl<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled </line>
         <line>is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, </line>
         <line>about 100 miles off. </line>

         <line>A proclamation, issued by Governor Macquarrie, appears </line>
         <line>in the Sidney Gazette of 14th May, stating that Peter Mills </line>
         <line>Acting Deputy Surveyor of Lands at Port Dalrymple, Van </line>
         <line>Dieman's Land, and George Williams, Acting Deputy Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>missary of Stores and provisions at the said settlement, had </line>
         <line>absconded from their habitations, and fled to the woods ; that </line>
         <line>their object was to live by rapine and violence ; to effect which </line>
         <line>they had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang </line>
         <line>of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed nume<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rous robberies–entering the lands of settlers, driving away </line>
         <line>their cattle, and plundering their houses. The proclamation </line>
         <line>declares that those who shall return to their houses and occu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pations before 1st December next, shall be pardoned and </line>
         <line>saved harmless from all offences, except the crime of wilful </line>
         <line>murder ; and denounces those who shall disregard this offer, </line>
         <line>as outlaws. </line>

         <line>Sydney, New South Walves, Jan. 4. </line>
         <line>The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, </line>
         <line>viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, </line>
         <line>and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has </line>
         <line>been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per </line>
         <line>lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the </line>
         <line>Island of Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea </line>
         <line>and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Maje<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters </line>
         <line>of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the </line>
         <line>natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands </line>
         <line>in the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction </line>
         <line>of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by </line>
         <line>British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency </line>
         <line>has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New </line>
         <line>South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to </line>
         <line>the naval officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 </line>
         <line>sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of </line>
         <line>hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sities between the natives, or take any part in any war that </line>
         <line>may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>habitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum </line>
         <line>specified in the bond. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>certaining the nature and fertility of the country, have disco<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence </line>
         <line>of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already </line>
         <line>sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is </line>
         <line>likely to be followed by others. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, </line>
         <line>in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his </line>
         <line>Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general </line>
         <line>good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also </line>
         <line>in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for </line>
         <line>the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of </line>
         <line>Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty </line>
         <line>of this town. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. </line>
         <line>The good understanding between the natives and our </line>
         <line>settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, </line>
         <line>has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced </line>
         <line>plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the </line>
         <line>veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rushed upon them before they could load again, and </line>
         <line>killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other </line>
         <line>two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs </line>
         <line>Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers </line>
         <line>falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the </line>
         <line>savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr Mac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>Arthur, killed the man and two women, named Sullivan and </line>
         <line>Herburg. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sydney, New South Wales, Feb. 12. </line>
         <line>On Monday last arrived the ship General Hewett, Cap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain Earle, from England, having a detachment of the 46th </line>
         <line>regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rived the Windham, Captain Bligh, also from England, </line>
         <line>having on board the head-quarters of the 46th regiment, </line>
         <line>commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Molle, who succeeded </line>
         <line>Lieutenant-Colonel O'Connell, as Lieutenant-Governor of </line>
         <line>the territory, and is accompanied by Mrs Molle and family ; </line>
         <line>also Lieutenant Walters, of the navy, agent for transports– </line>
         <line>Of the 300 convicts which the General Hewett received on </line>

         <line>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] </line>
         <line>Quebec, July 15. </line>
         <line>The commercial world is flourishing here, but in </line>
         <line>political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in </line>
         <line>the back ground. The old defensive system is still </line>
         <line>adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforce<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments, we shall do little good till we have another </line>
         <line>commander in chief. There is now a great body of </line>
         <line>regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave </line>
         <line>fellows have recently been almost sacrificed <i>par la</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>petite guerre</i> at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vince, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arriv<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed from France do not conceal their sentiments– </line>
         <line>On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, </line>
         <line>our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>marks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonel commanding stepped forward and told him </line>
         <line>plainly, that such systems were now completely ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ploded–that he had had the honour of ser<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ving very lately under a much more celebrated </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line>General that it was probable he would ever serve </line>
         <line>under again–that his men had been accustomed to </line>
         <line>fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was </line>
         <line>called on to follow, he should certainly retire from </line>
         <line>the service. Such language you may suppose was </line>
         <line>not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy </line>
         <line>to find that we now have military men amongst us, </line>
         <line>who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the </line>
         <line>numberless representations of civilians are not much </line>
         <line>attended to. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Montreal, July 14. </line>
         <line>I consider this country now as perfectly secure </line>
         <line>against any attempts that the Americans may make, </line>
         <line>not withstanding the system of our chief does not </line>
         <line>seem to be changed. He has received a great many </line>
         <line>more troops this year than he had any idea of, and </line>
         <line>does not seem pleased at having so large a force un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>his command, as the country will now look to </line>
         <line>him for some offensive operation against the enemy. </line>
         <line>He has done nothing the whole summer but pa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes </line>
         <line>them march past him twice a-week, bowing and </line>
         <line>scraping, instead of emplying them where they </line>
         <line>ought to be. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>You will have heard of an American army of </line>
         <line>about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having </line>
         <line>crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, </line>
         <line>with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them </line>
         <line>but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>siderable loss. I inclose a general order published </line>
         <line>yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby </line>
         <line>you will find that our loss has been great. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly </line>
         <line>any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that </line>
         <line>so great a body of men, as are now on the other side </line>
         <line>of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at </line>
         <line>least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of </line>
         <line>parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper </line>
         <line>province. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take </line>
         <line>place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to </line>
         <line>think that such an enemy should be able to make an </line>
         <line>attack upon us with impunity. </line>

         <line>The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th </line>
         <line>August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken </line>
         <line>by the British. This place was considered as of great impor<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer </line>
         <line>had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, </line>
         <line>when he met with this accident. </line>
      </p>

         <line>On the 31st August, the British troops broke their en<sh/>

         <line>campment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceeded immediately to take possession of the position which </line>
         <line>the American army had just abandoned at the village of </line>
         <line>Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, </line>
         <line>and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and part<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British </line>

      <p>
         <line>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieute<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack </line>
         <line>was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d </line>
         <line>regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and </line>
         <line>Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two </line>
         <line>former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get </line>
         <line>possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Ame<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ricans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This </line>
         <line>latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns des<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, </line>
         <line>and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses </line>
         <line>inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against </line>
         <line>them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, </line>
         <line>which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a </line>
         <line>number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused </line>
         <line>by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our </line>
         <line>conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss </line>
         <line>of both officers and men. </line>

      <p>
         <line>Quebec, Sept. 3. </line>
         <line>The army from this province has entered the United States </line>
         <line>by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was </line>
         <line>at Chazy. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Quebec, Sept. 8. </line>
         <line>From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs </line>
         <line>M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, </line>
         <line>have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, </line>
         <line>at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>can forces sent there to recapture it. The following are </line>
         <line>the particulars of that expedition :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans </line>
         <line>landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island </line>
         <line>(Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground </line>
         <line>cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at </line>
         <line>anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of </line>
         <line>grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed </line>
         <line>directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced </line>
         <line>towards the woods. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison </line>
         <line>(150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians </line>
         <line>were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from out<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>flanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's inten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion to land on another part of the island, a certain number of </line>
         <line>Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians </line>
         <line>absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was enter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison </line>
         <line>from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back </line>
         <line>between the two forts, and there await the advance of the </line>
         <line>enemy. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left </line>
         <line>flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right </line>
         <line>flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, </line>
         <line>which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other </line>
         <line>by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed </line>
         <line>by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of </line>
         <line>reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of </line>
         <line>their retreat. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred </line>
         <line>men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, </line>
         <line>with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found </line>
         <line>on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by </line>
         <line>the enemy were these: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent </line>
         <line>against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ry's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither </line>
         <line>troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their </line>
         <line>usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &amp;c. Major </line>
         <line>Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate </line>
         <line>plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging </line>
         <line>to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, </line>
         <line>and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees </line>
         <line>prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, </line>
         <line>fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. </line>
         <line>Let two suffice for the present. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furni<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized </line>
         <line>upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major </line>
         <line>Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's </line>
         <line>son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the </line>
         <line>most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, </line>
         <line>and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was </line>
         <line>his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses </line>
         <line>and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, suf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>foration[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings </line>
         <line>in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and </line>
         <line>thereby effected a timely escape. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in cart<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to </line>
         <line>the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in </line>
         <line>flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal </line>
         <line>making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and </line>
         <line>his bones seen there by the writer of this."/&gt;</line>

         <line>Montreal, Oct. 29 </line>
         <line>The express from Upper Canada, which arrived </line>
         <line>yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory </line>
         <line>reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had </line>
         <line>precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they </line>
         <line>had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their </line>
         <line>force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Further accounts from Kingston have been receiv<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed this morning to the 26th instant, when the official </line>
         <line>report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the </line>
         <line>destruction of the works, had not reached that place, </line>
         <line>but there was no doubt of the fact. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps </line>
         <line>pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which </line>
         <line>arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours </line>
         <line>from Fort George, further confirms the previous </line>
         <line>intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners </line>
         <line>were taken, before the Americans effected their </line>
         <line>escape across the river. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the 18th the British came up with his rear </line>
         <line>guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans </line>
         <line>were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening </line>
         <line>on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– </line>
         <line>The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation </line>
         <line>to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tifications. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A military courier from Kingston arrived this </line>
         <line>morning, brings no additional news of importance.– </line>
         <line>Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the </line>
         <line>sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again </line>
         <line>sailed for the head of the Lake. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, </line>
         <line>says that a severe action took place the day before </line>
         <line>near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and </line>
         <line>wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be </line>
         <line>very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon </line>
         <line>one of his columns did great execution. Another </line>
         <line>letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wound<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed 25 or 30. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Montreal, Nov. 5. </line>
         <line>From Upper Canada we have received nothing of </line>
         <line>importance. The report of the whole American </line>
         <line>armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as </line>
         <line>the last accounts from that quarter mention that Ge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>neral Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Quebec, Nov. 3. </line>
         <line>We are in expectation of some further details of </line>
         <line>the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's </line>
         <line>Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one </line>
         <line>o'clock. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on </line>
         <line>that frontier is a striking illustration of the impor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tance of the command of the lake. The enemy did </line>
         <line>cross over to our side till the moment his fleet </line>
         <line>was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ance of our fleet effected what could not be done by </line>
         <line>the expence of so much blood and treasure. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>(From the Quebec Gazette) </line>
         <line>The American Government has published the pa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We </line>
         <line>confess that we have seen these papers with feelings </line>
         <line>of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction </line>
         <line>that we can now say that the honour of the British </line>
         <line>Government is pledged to do something for Bri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tish interests in North American, and regret that that </line>
         <line>something is so little. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Indians are to be made independent of both </line>
         <line>nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under </line>
         <line>certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of </line>
         <line>these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively </line>
         <line>British. On these subjects we must be permitted to </line>
         <line>ask how long they would be permitted to remain </line>
         <line>so, how long the Indians would retain their inde<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pendence in the event of another war, if the commu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nication with them should be in the power of the </line>
         <line>enemy ? The sole communication for military pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poses, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river </line>
         <line>St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from </line>
         <line>Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be </line>
         <line>permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! </line>
         <line>The enemy has hitherto been prevented from inter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rupting this communication by the thinness of the </line>
         <line>settlements of their side, the consequent badness of </line>
         <line>the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. </line>
         <line>The possession of th southern bank of the St Law<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power </line>
         <line>of supplying themselves, and operating on that fron<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake </line>
         <line>Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, </line>
         <line>during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to </line>
         <line>parcel our force to support the line of communication </line>
         <line>between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a </line>
         <line>great proportion of it to protect the base of that line </line>
         <line>in the vicinity of Montreal. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The position of Canada, relative to the United </line>
         <line>States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men </line>
         <line>have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond </line>
         <line>Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's prepa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rations, the superiority which we then had on the </line>
         <line>Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and </line>
         <line>the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, </line>
         <line>alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting </line>
         <line>and conveying supplies by a communication of five </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the ene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>my's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perience has made acquainted with the fact, or who </line>
         <line>are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>munication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the </line>
         <line>supply of any force further advanced on the line be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>comes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives </line>
         <line>his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army </line>
         <line>can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long </line>
         <line>way in his rear, protected by his army, a country co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vered with woods, and a militia more effective than </line>
         <line>the best troops in such a country, always ready for </line>
         <line>the protection of their property and their houses– </line>
         <line>Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army </line>
         <line>beyond a certain point is to be counted by its num<sh/>

         <line>bers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part </line>

         <line>essential to the security and preservation of the coun<sh/>

         <line>breaking up the settlements. There is now a large </line>

         <line>most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed </line>

         <line>The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, </line>
         <line>after a session of four weeks. The principal laws </line>
         <line>passed are: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of </line>
         <line>this State. </line>
         <line>An act to encourage privateering. </line>
         <line>An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. </line>
         <line>An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of </line>
         <line>money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New </line>
         <line>York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. </line>
         <line>An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. </line>
         <line>An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of </line>
         <line>colour. </line>
         <line>An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>teers, and for paying the militia called into service by the </line>
         <line>State authority. </line>
         <line>An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>my and navy of the United States. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The first act authorises the Governor to call into </line>
         <line>actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years, </line>
         <line>provided the Government of the United States shall </line>
         <line>have declared their intention to pay, clothe and sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sist them at their expence. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The privateer bill authorises associations to incor<sh/>

         <line>porate themselves for the purpose of fitting out pri<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nell, passed both Houses of our Legislature unani<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mously on Saturday:– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of </line>
         <line>the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of sur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>prise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms </line>
         <line>proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, how<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their </line>
         <line>country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice </line>
         <line>of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly </line>
         <line>recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the </line>
         <line>vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of </line>
         <line>the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an ho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their </line>
         <line>posterity their rights, liberty, and independence. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The following is a private letter which was brought </line>
         <line>by the Liffey : </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. </line>
         <line>"Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the </line>
         <line>10th October, where his presence has been of the ut<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>most importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade </line>
         <line>of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was </line>
         <line>ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's </line>
         <line>arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of </line>
         <line>the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for </line>
         <line>the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the </line>
         <line>evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by </line>
         <line>General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 </line>
         <line>men, advanced upon General Drummond, and at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th </line>
         <line>instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpect<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by them, and making no impression, retired on </line>
         <line>the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they </line>
         <line>advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the </line>
         <line>19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempt<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its </line>
         <line>mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about </line>
         <line>1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them </line>
         <line>most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in </line>
         <line>which the Glengarries supported their high charac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter, and, in the evening, <i>Jonathan</i> finding himself </line>
         <line>foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the </line>
         <line>horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main </line>
         <line>body at Black Creek. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– </line>
         <line>those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, </line>
         <line>though he refrained from exposing himself to our </line>
         <line>fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces </line>
         <line>there, and whenever the enemy showed a column </line>
         <line>out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon o<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bliged them to return to their shelter. By this time </line>
         <line>our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, </line>
         <line>and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort </line>
         <line>Erie. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by </line>
         <line>our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close </line>
         <line>to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the </line>
         <line>high ground, which General Drummond had not </line>
         <line>left many weeks before, and could push no further. </line>
         <line>At the date of the last accounts from General Drum<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which </line>
         <line>it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lodge him, but as they are now on their way to join </line>
         <line>the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have </line>
         <line>the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expul<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is </line>
         <line>said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of Ge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>neral Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that </line>
         <line>they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, </line>
         <line>leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pable of defending it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton </line>
         <line>of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He </line>
         <line>sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 </line>
         <line>men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>giments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. </line>
         <line>The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to </line>
         <line>York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, </line>
         <line>850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, </line>
         <line>but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, </line>
         <line>89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by </line>
         <line>this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to </line>
         <line>make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved </line>
         <line>a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. </line>
         <line>The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she </line>
         <line>has been laid down and lengthened to make her the </line>
         <line>size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid </line>
         <line>down there. The Americans are said to have com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>menced upon two more ships of the class of the Su<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th </line>
         <line>October state, that the capture of the two schooners </line>
         <line>will be attended with the most important benefits in </line>
         <line>the security of that post, and the territory dependent </line>
         <line>upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment </line>
         <line>of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rived there on the 14th October, without any cas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his </line>
         <line>brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two </line>
         <line>schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sions and supplies, and would attempt another before </line>
         <line>the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been </line>
         <line>sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and </line>
         <line>supplying General Drummond's army being com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pleted, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being </line>
         <line>deemed impracticable this season, Sir George return<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed last evening to this place ; his journey to King<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ston has certainly had the effect of inducing Ge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>neral Brown, with a considerable part of his force, </line>
         <line>to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left </line>
         <line>General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that </line>
         <line>I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon </line>
         <line>him. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party </line>
         <line>here has been at work at your side of the water ; it </line>
         <line>has increased tenfold since the expression of the </line>
         <line>public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the </line>
         <line>addresses which are now preparing, and which I </line>

         <line>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the </line>
         <line>Blue Mountains, performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Governor desires to communicate, for the </line>
         <line>information of the public, the result of his late </line>
         <line>tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dertaken for the purpose of being enabled per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sonally to appreciate the importance of the track </line>
         <line>of country lying westward of them, which had </line>
         <line>been explored in the latter end of the year 1813, </line>
         <line>and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William </line>
         <line>Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>To those who know how very limited a track </line>
         <line>of country has been hitherto occupied by the </line>
         <line>colonists of New South Walves, extending along </line>
         <line>the eastern coast to the north and south of Port </line>
         <line>Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 </line>
         <line>miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in </line>
         <line>the interior which forms its western boundary, </line>
         <line>it must be a subject of astonishment and regret, </line>
         <line>that amongst so large a population no one ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>peared, within the first twenty-five years of the </line>
         <line>establishment of this settlement, possessed of suf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficient energy of mind to induce him fully to ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plore a passage over these mountains ; but when </line>
         <line>it is considered that for the greater part of that </line>
         <line>time even this circumscribed portion of country </line>
         <line>afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the </line>
         <line>people, whilst on the other hand, the whole sur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>face of the country beyond those limits was a </line>
         <line>thick, and in many places, nearly an impene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trable forest, the surprise at the want of effort to </line>
         <line>surmount such difficulties must abate very con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>siderably. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The records of the colony only afford two in<sh/>

         <line>stances of any bold attempt having been made to </line>
         <line>discover the country to the westward of the Blue </line>
         <line>Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the </line>
         <line>other by Mr Caley, and both ended in disap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pointment; a cirumstance which will not be </line>
         <line>much wondered at by those who have lately cross<sh/>

         <line>the importance of the object, had, early after his </line>
         <line>arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of </line>
         <line>encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the </line>
         <line>western country, and willingly availed himself of </line>
         <line>the facilities which the discoveries of these three </line>
         <line>gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the </line>
         <line>20th of November 1813, he entrusted the ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>complishment of this object to Mr George Wil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>liam Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result </line>
         <line>of whose journey was laid before the public, </line>
         <line>through the medium of the Sydney Gazette, on </line>
         <line>the 12th of February, 1814. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The favourable account given by Mr Evans </line>
         <line>of the country he had explored, induced the </line>
         <line>Governor to cause a road to be constructed for </line>
         <line>the passage and conveyance of cattle and pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions to the interior ; and men of good cha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>racter, from amongst a number of convicts who </line>
         <line>had volunteered their services, were selected to </line>
         <line>perform this arduous work, on condition of be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing fed and clothed during the continuance of </line>
         <line>their labour, and being granted emancipations </line>
         <line>as their final reward on the completion of the </line>
         <line>work. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The direction and superintendence of this great </line>
         <line>work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the </line>
         <line>chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the asto<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nishment of every one who knows what was to be </line>
         <line>encountered, and sees what has been done, he </line>
         <line>effected its completion in six months from the </line>
         <line>time of its commencement, happily without the </line>
         <line>loss of a man, or any serious accident. The </line>
         <line>Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the </line>
         <line>services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in </line>
         <line>the execution of this arduous work, which pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mises to be of the greatest public utility, by </line>
         <line>opening a new source of wealth to the indus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trious and enterprising. When it is considered </line>
         <line>that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forts of his own house, and the society of his </line>
         <line>numerous family, and exposed himself to much </line>
         <line>personal fatigue, with only such temporary co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vering as the bark hut could afford from the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>clemency of the season, it is difficult to express </line>
         <line>the sentiments of approbation to which such pri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vations and services are entitled. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Cox having reported the road as complet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed on the 21st of January, the Governor, ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>companied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that gentle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>man, commenced his tour on the 25th of April </line>
         <line>last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined </line>
         <line>by Sir John Jamieson, at the Nepean, who ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>companied him during the entire tour. The fol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lowing gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: </line>
         <line>Mr Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>jor of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts, Aide de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> camp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr </line>
         <line>Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy </line>
         <line>Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin, Painter and Na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor of </line>
         <line>lands, who had been sent forward for the pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pose of making further discoveries, and rejoined </line>
         <line>the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst </line>
         <line>Plains. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The commencement of the ascent from Emu </line>
         <line>Plains to the first depot, and thence to a resting </line>
         <line>place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve </line>
         <line>miles from Emu Ford, was through a very hand<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>some open forests of lofty trees, and much more </line>
         <line>practicable and easy than was expected. The </line>
         <line>facility of the ascent for this distance excited </line>
         <line>surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to </line>
         <line>give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he </line>
         <line>has afterwards to encounter. At a further dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stance of four miles a sudden change is perceiv<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed in the appearance of the timber and the qua<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lity of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and </line>
         <line>the latter barren and rocky. At this place, the </line>
         <line>fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. </line>
         <line>Here the country became altogether mountain<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ous, and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th </line>
         <line>mile (it is to be observed that the measure com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted </line>
         <line>attention. It is close to the line of road, on the </line>
         <line>top of a rugged and abrupt ascent, and is sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed to have been placed there by Mr Caley, as </line>
         <line>the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernor gave that part of the mountain the name </line>
         <line>as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so </line>
         <line>far was at that time an effort of no small difficul<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a </line>
         <line>succession of steep and rugged hills, some of </line>
         <line>which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage </line>
         <line>altogether ; but at this place a considerable ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the </line>
         <line>summit of the western mountains ; and from </line>
         <line>thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect </line>
         <line>presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town </line>
         <line>of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect </line>
         <column/>
         <line>Hill, and other objects within that part of the </line>
         <line>colony now inhabited, of equal interest, are dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinctly seen from hence. The majestic gran<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deur of the situation, combined with the various </line>
         <line>objects to be seen from this place, induced the </line>
         <line>Governor to give it the appellation of the King's </line>
         <line>Table Land. On the south-west side of the </line>
         <line>King's Table Land the mountain terminates in </line>
         <line>abrupt precipices of immense depth, at the bot<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tom of which is seen a glen, as romantically </line>
         <line>beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the </line>
         <line>further side by mountains of great magnitude, </line>
         <line>terminating equally abruptly as the others, and </line>
         <line>the whole thickly covered with wood. The </line>
         <line>length of this picturesque and remarkable track of </line>
         <line>country is about 24 miles, to which the Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernor gave the name of the Prince Regent's </line>
         <line>Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third </line>
         <line>mile, on the top of a hill, an opening presents </line>
         <line>itself on the south-west side of the Prince </line>
         <line>Regent's Glen, from whence a view is obtained </line>
         <line>particularly beautiful and grand–mountains ris<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing beyond mountains, with stupendous masses </line>
         <line>of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye </line>
         <line>with admiration and astonishment. The circular </line>
         <line>form in which the whole is so wonderfully dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed induced the Governor to give the name of </line>
         <line>Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right </line>
         <line>Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the </line>
         <line>Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from </line>
         <line>hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of </line>
         <line>the mountain which forms one side of the Prince </line>
         <line>Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly terminates </line>
         <line>in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet </line>
         <line>high, as ascertained by measurement. The road </line>
         <line>constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and </line>
         <line>tremendous descent, through all its windings, is </line>
         <line>no less than three-fourths of a mile in length, </line>
         <line>and has been executed with such skill and sta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bility as reflects much credit on him. The la<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bour here undergone, and the difficulties sur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mounted, can only be appreciated by those who </line>
         <line>view this scene. In order to perpetuate the me<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor deem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name </line>
         <line>to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descend<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed into a valley at the bottom of this pass, the </line>
         <line>retrospective view of the overhanging mountain </line>
         <line>is magnificently grand. Although the present </line>
         <line>pass is the only practicable point yet discovered </line>
         <line>for descending by, yet the mountain is much </line>
         <line>higher than those on either side of it, from </line>
         <line>whence it is distinguished at a considerable dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tance, when approaching it from the interior, </line>
         <line>and in this point of view it has the appearance </line>
         <line>of a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact </line>
         <line>only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The </line>
         <line>Governor gave the name of Mount York to this </line>
         <line>termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal </line>
         <line>Highness the Duke of York. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was </line>
         <line>much gratified by the appearance of good pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was </line>
         <line>the first he had met with since the commencement </line>
         <line>of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount </line>
         <line>York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in conse<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quence of the strong resemblance it bore to the </line>
         <line>vale of that name in North Wales. The grass </line>
         <line>in this vale is of a good quality, and very [?]<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it </line>
         <line>from the eastward, which unites itself at the </line>
         <line>western extremity of the vale with another ri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vulet containing still more water. The junction </line>
         <line>of these two streams forms a very handsome river, </line>
         <line>now called by the Governor, Cox's River, which </line>
         <line>takes its course, as has been since ascertained </line>
         <line>through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties </line>
         <line>itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tured, from the nature of the country through </line>
         <line>which it passes, that it mut be one of the prin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cipal causes of the floods which have been occa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkes<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bury, into which the Nepean discharges itself. </line>
         <line>The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of Mount </line>
         <line>York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, </line>
         <line>and has its termination at Cox's River. West<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ward of this river the country again becomes </line>
         <line>hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and </line>
         <line>very good passage. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of </line>
         <line>Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland, Wentworth, and Law<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>son, had formerly terminated their excursion ; </line>
         <line>and when the various difficulties are consider<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed which they had to contend with, especially </line>
         <line>until they had effected the descent from Mount </line>
         <line>York, to which place they were obliged to pass </line>
         <line>through a thick brush-wood, where they were </line>
         <line>under the necessity of cutting a passage for </line>
         <line>their baggage horses, the severity of which </line>
         <line>labour had seriously affected their healths, </line>
         <line>their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot </line>
         <line>fail to excite much surprise and admiration. </line>
         <line>In commemoration of their merits, three beauti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful high hills, joining each other at the end of </line>
         <line>their tour at this place, have receieved their </line>
         <line>names in the following order, viz. Mount Blax<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's </line>
         <line>Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and </line>
         <line>narrow vallies alternately form the track of </line>
         <line>country from Cox's River, for a distance of 16 </line>
         <line>miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the </line>
         <line>stage between these rivers is consequently very </line>
         <line>severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this </line>
         <line>range the Governor gave the name of Clarence </line>
         <line>Hilly Range. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short </line>
         <line>distance from it, a very singular and beautiful </line>
         <line>mountain attracts the attentions, its summit be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing crowned with a large and very extraordinary </line>
         <line>looking rock, nearly circular in form, which </line>
         <line>gives the whole very much the appearance of </line>
         <line>a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To </line>
         <line>this lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first Eu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ropean discoverer, gave the name of Mount </line>
         <line>Evans. Passing on from hence the country con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ally improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is </line>
         <line>distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight </line>
         <line>miles. The land here is level, and the first met </line>
         <line>with unencumbered with timber. It is not of </line>
         <line>very considerable extent, but abounds with a </line>
         <line>great variety of herbs and plants, such as would </line>
         <line>probably highly interest and gratify the scientific </line>
         <line>botanist. The beautiful little valley runs north<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>west and south-east, between hills of easy ascent, </line>
         <line>thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth </line>
         <line>Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in </line>
         <line>other respects resembles very much the country </line>
         <line>to the eastward of the valley for some miles. </line>
         <line>Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles </line>
         <line>from Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was high<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly gratified by the appearance of the country, </line>
         <line>which there began to exhibity an open and ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile </line>
         <line>plains. Judging from the height of the banks, </line>
         <line>and its general width, the Campbell River must </line>
         <line>be on some occasions of very considerable mag<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nitude ; but the extraordinary drought which </line>
         <line>has apparently prevailed on the western side of </line>
         <line>the mountains, equally as throughout this colony </line>
         <column/>
         <line>for the last three years, has reduced this river </line>
         <line>so much, that it may be more properly called a </line>
         <line>chain of pools than a running stream at the pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sent time. In the reaches or pools of the Camp<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bell River, the very curious animal called the </line>
         <line>Paradox, or Water Mole, is seen in great num<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly </line>
         <line>rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. </line>
         <line>Two miles to the southward of the line of road </line>
         <line>which crosses the Campbell River, there is a </line>
         <line>very fine rich track of low lands, which has been </line>
         <line>named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here </line>
         <line>growing in considerable quanities. The Fish </line>
         <line>River, which forms a junction with the Campbell </line>
         <line>River a few miles to the northward of the road </line>
         <line>and bridge over the latter, has also two very </line>
         <line>fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nel Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both </line>
         <line>of considerable extent, and very capable of yield<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing all the necessities of life. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge </line>
         <line>over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open </line>
         <line>to the view, presenting a rich track of cham<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>paign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on </line>
         <line>both sides by gently rising and very beautiful </line>
         <line>hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River, </line>
         <line>which is constituted by the junction of the Fish </line>
         <line>and Campbell River, takes a winding course </line>
         <line>through the Plains, which can be easily traced </line>
         <line>from the high lands ajoining, by the particular </line>
         <line>verdure of the trees on its banks, which are like<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wise the only trees throughout the extent of the </line>
         <line>plains. The level and clean surface of these </line>
         <line>plains gives them at first view very much the </line>
         <line>appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is impossible to behold this grand scene </line>
         <line>without a feeling of admiration and surprise, </line>
         <line>whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a </line>
         <line>space of such extent and beauty as seems design<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of </line>
         <line>man created a degree of melancholy in the mind </line>
         <line>which may be more easily imagined than de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>scribed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains </line>
         <line>on Thursday the 4th of May, and encamped on </line>
         <line>the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie </line>
         <line>River–the situation being selected in conse<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quence of its commanding a beautiful and exten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sive prospect for many miles in every direction </line>
         <line>around it. At this place the Governor remained </line>
         <line>for a week, which time he occupied in making </line>
         <line>excursions in different directions through the </line>
         <line>adjoining country, on both sides the river. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor </line>
         <line>fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town </line>
         <line>at some future period, to which he gave the name </line>
         <line>of Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary </line>
         <line>of State for the Colonies. The situation of Ba<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach </line>
         <line>of any floods which may occur, and is at the </line>
         <line>same time so near to the river on its south bank </line>
         <line>as to derive all the advantages of its clear and </line>
         <line>beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of </line>
         <line>whatever description who may be hereafter per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mitted to form permanent residences to them<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>selves at this place will have the highly import<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ant advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a </line>
         <line>beautiful river flowing through it, for all the uses </line>
         <line>of man. The Governor mut however add, that </line>
         <line>the hopes which were once so sanguinely enter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tained of this river becoming navigable to the </line>
         <line>Western Sea have ended in disappointment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>During the week that the Governor remained </line>
         <line>at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various </line>
         <line>directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a </line>
         <line>south-west direction, and on that occasion, as </line>
         <line>well as on all the others, he found the country </line>
         <line>chiefly composed of vallies and plains, separated </line>
         <line>occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil </line>
         <line>throughout being generally fertile, and well cir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or </line>
         <line>grazing. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Governor here feels much pleasure in be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing enabled to communicate to the public that </line>
         <line>the favourable reports which he had received of </line>
         <line>the country to the west of the Blue Mountains </line>
         <line>have not been by any means exaggerated. The </line>
         <line>difficulties which present themselves in the jour<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ney from hence are certainly great and inevi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>table, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to </line>
         <line>become permanent settlers there will probably con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tent themselves withvisiting this part of the colony </line>
         <line>but rarely, and of course will have them seldom </line>
         <line>to encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficien<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cy of grass are to be found in the mountains for </line>
         <line>the support of such cattle as may be sent over </line>
         <line>them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turage which the new country affords are fully </line>
         <line>extensive enough for any increase of population </line>
         <line>and stock which can possibly take place for ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ny years. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of </line>
         <line>Bathurst there is not less than 50,000 acres of </line>
         <line>land clear of timber, and fully one half of that </line>
         <line>may be considered excellent soil, well calculated </line>
         <line>for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in </line>
         <line>proportion as the soil improves the timber dege<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nerates ; and it is to be remarked, that every<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>where to the westward of the mountains it is </line>
         <line>much inferior both in size and quality to that </line>
         <line>within the present colony ; there is, however, a </line>
         <line>sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within </line>
         <line>the district around Bathurst for the purposes of </line>
         <line>house-building and husbandry. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Governor has here to lament that neither </line>
         <line>coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in </line>
         <line>the western country ; articles in themselves of </line>
         <line>so much importance, that the want of them must </line>
         <line>be severely felt whenever that country shall </line>
         <line>be settled. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Having enumerated the principal and most im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portant features of this new country, the Gover<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nor has now to notice some of its live produc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety </line>
         <line>of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a </line>
         <line>great quantity of fish, but all of one denomina<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, resembling the perch in appearance, and of </line>
         <line>a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a </line>
         <line>rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and </line>
         <line>is very voracious. Several of them were caught </line>
         <line>during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at </line>
         <line>the halting place on the Fish River. One of </line>
         <line>those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people </line>
         <line>stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught </line>
         <line>some weighing 25 lb. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black </line>
         <line>swans, wild geese, wild turkies, bustards, ducks </line>
         <line>of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>geons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or paradox, </line>
         <line>also abounds in all the rivers and ponds. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by </line>
         <line>observation taken at the Flag Staff, which was </line>
         <line>erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that </line>
         <line>name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, </line>
         <line>being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House, </line>
         <line>In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing west 20. </line>
         <line>30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute </line>
         <line>miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney </line>
         <line>to Bathurst being 140 English miles. </line>

      <p>
         <line>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the </line>
         <column/>
         <line>party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on </line>
         <line>the left bank of the river Nepean, and is thence </line>
         <line>carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. </line>
         <line>This road has been carefully measured, and each </line>
         <line>mile regularly marked on the trees growing on </line>
         <line>the left side of the road proceeding towards Ba<sh/>

         <line>The Governor in his tour made the following </line>
         <line>stages, in which he was principally regulated by </line>
         <line>the consideration of having good pasturage for </line>
         <line>the cattle, and plenty of water :– </line>

         <line>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Gover<sh/>

         <line>return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Governor deems it expedient here to no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tify to the public, that he does not mean to make </line>
         <line>any grants of land to the westward of the Blue </line>
         <line>Mountains, until he shall receive the commands </line>
         <line>of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and </line>
         <line>in reply to the report he is now about to make </line>
         <line>them upon it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other </line>
         <line>respectable free persons as may wish to visit this </line>
         <line>new country will be permitted to do so, on mak<sh/>

         <line>effect, who will order them to be furnished with </line>
         <line>written passes. It is at the same time strictly or<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dered and directed that no person, whether civil </line>
         <line>or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue </line>
         <line>Mountains without having previously applied for </line>
         <line>and obtained permission, in the above prescribed </line>
         <line>form. The military guard stationed at the first </line>

         </line>
         <line>tions to prevent the progress of any persons who </line>
         <line>shall not have obtained regular passes. The ne<sh/>

         <line>Montreal, Oct. 5. </line>
         <line>On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie </line>
         <line>seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, </line>
         <line>amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived </line>
         <line>at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the es<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>At length we have authentic accounts relating </line>
         <line>to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very </line>
         <line>important, as many <i>ex parte</i> details have been </line>
         <line>published - his taking Fort William by storm, </line>
         <line>making all the partners of the North West Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pany prisoners, &amp;c. ; but the cause of the expe </line>
         <line>dition has never been explained. The Canadian </line>
         <line>Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– </line>
         <line>Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General </line>
         <line>The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, </line>
         <line>towards the close of the year 1815, took posses<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion of two establishments belonging to the North </line>
         <line>West Company, which had obtruded themselves </line>
         <line>on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. </line>
         <line>The North West traders then altered their </line>
         <line>route, going into the Upper Country by circuit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ous ways, by which much delay took place ; and </line>
         <line>in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cart<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>loads of provisions by the former track in June </line>
         <line>last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, </line>
         <line>twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of </line>
         <line>the natives, whom they took forward with them </line>
         <line>to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed </line>
         <line>within four miles of the settlement ; they were </line>
         <line>perceived by the Governor, and were attacked </line>
         <line>by a party from the garrison, consisting of about </line>
         <line>thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 </line>
         <line>of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces </line>
         <line>returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>count that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was </line>
         <line>undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ducting the expedition we do not justify, nor in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deed can we form any opinion on the subject </line>
         <line>without further authentic details ; it is, however, </line>
         <line>but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pany have rights, and are a chartered Company ; </line>
         <line>the North West Traders, though we believe a </line>
         <line>most respectable body, are only an Association </line>
         <line>of Merchants. </line>

      <p>
         <line>"In the newspapers which I sent you, you will see some </line>
         <line>accounts of the disturbances which have taken place in the North </line>
         <line>West between the North West Company and Lord Selkirk's co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonists. The latter have been obliged to leave the Red River, </line>
         <line>after having had 22 of their men, including Governor Semple, </line>
         <line>killed by a party of <i>half-breeds,</i> the spurious offspring of the </line>
         <line>North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate </line>
         <line>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party </line>
         <line>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr </line>
         <line>Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, </line>
         <line>to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>menced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's </line>
         <line>account is that these <i>half-breeds</i> with some <i>Indians</i> were bring<sh/>

         <line>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the </line>
         <line>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort </line>
         <line>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<sh/>

         <line>On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, </line>
         <line>we embarked on board the Importer, D. </line>
         <line>Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we </line>
         <line>arrived on the 5th of May, with about 40 steer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>age passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who </line>
         <line>were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>spects that can be named our passage disa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>greeable, and upon one occasion very perilous, </line>
         <line>from lightning, which struck the ship twice, </line>
         <line>shivered two of the masts, killed a man, struck </line>
         <line>several people slightly, between two of whom I </line>
         <line>was sitting, without at all feeling the blow. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Some of our fellow-passengers have found </line>
         <line>great disappointment ; and, it is stated in some </line>
         <line>of the public papers here, that many hundreds </line>
         <line>have, during the last year, accepted of the offer </line>
         <line>of our Consul at New York to go and settle in </line>
         <line>Canada. You know that I have never advised any </line>
         <line>body to emigrate. I have always said that it is </line>
         <line>no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to </line>
         <line>live without work ; no place for a farmer who </line>
         <line>does not work himself ; no place in short, for </line>
         <line>any one who is not able and willing to work </line>
         <line>at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such </line>
         <line>men there is every where a plentiful, happy, </line>
         <line>and easy life. None should come, however, </line>
         <line>who have any views of idleness ; and even </line>
         <line>for the industrious poor, I see no reason why </line>
         <line>they should expend their last shilling, and under<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>go all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage, </line>
         <line>in order to save those who eat the taxes the ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and </line>
         <line>his wife and a child or two cannot come under </line>
         <line>the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single </line>
         <line>man 20 guineas, before he gets into work again ; </line>
         <line>and, as I always said, I never would, if I were </line>
         <line>in the place of such a man, expend my earnings </line>
         <line>on a sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, </line>
         <line>in order to remove one eye sore out of the way </line>
         <line>of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, </line>
         <line>which is not so good as ours, though it is not </line>
         <line>bad, and people often live to an old age. The </line>
         <line>country is good, but it will easily be conceived, </line>
         <line>that new face, an entire new scene, a separa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion from every friend, work done in a quite dif<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ferent way from it is in England ; it will</line>
         <line>easily be conceived, that all this makes such a </line>
         <line>dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very </line>
         <line>unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect </line>
         <line>to find work the first day. He must ask first, at </line>
         <line>any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and, they </line>
         <line>are sure to find rascals enough here to foster </line>
         <line>their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the </line>
         <line>cause of corruption at home. In short, I advice </line>
         <line>nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe </line>
         <line>the country and the people. As to emigrating with </line>
         <line>a view of settling and farming in the new countries, </line>
         <line>it is neither more nor less than downright mad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ness. It is what our English farmers know no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing at all about ; it is what they are not at all </line>
         <line>fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culations end in disappointment, if not in ruin </line>
         <line>and premature death. I hope that our beloved </line>
         <line>country will shortly be fit for an honest and in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dustrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come </line>
         <line>with money in their pockets, my advice is, not </line>
         <line>to give way either to enthusiastic admiration, or </line>
         <line>to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to look </line>
         <line>about them ; to see not only after good land, but </line>
         <line>a good market for its products. The western </line>
         <line>romance writers tell us, that the land in the </line>
         <line>Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>able book, tells us, that beef and pork sell for </line>
         <line>three halfpence a pound. An excellent coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try for people who want to do nothing but eat. – </line>
         <line>Give me Long Island, where the land is not too </line>
         <line>good ; but where beef and pork sell for about </line>
         <line>eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); </line>
         <line>where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and </line>
         <line>where there is a ready market for every species of </line>
         <line>produce. One thing above all ; if an English far<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mer (I mean by English, people of the whole of </line>
         <line>the United Kingdom) comes here, with money </line>
         <line>in his pocket, let him resolve to keep it there for </line>
         <line>a year, and then he will be sure to do well. – </line>
         <line>All that I see around me here is well calculated to </line>
         <line>attract the attention and to please the sight of one, </line>
         <line>like myself, brought up in the country, always </line>
         <line>greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in, </line>
         <line>various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The </line>
         <line>The people are engaged busily in planting their In<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dian corn. The cherry trees, of which there are </line>
         <line>multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or </line>
         <line>round the fields, have dropped their blossom and </line>
         <line>begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple </line>
         <line>and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty </line>
         <line>acres on each farm, are in full and beautiful </line>
         <line>bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pearance of want amongst the labourers, who re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceive, in the country, about two shillings and </line>
         <line>threepence (our money) a-day, with board and </line>
         <line>lodging, and which board consists of plenty of </line>
         <line>excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of </line>
         <line>bread, butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may </line>
         <line>form some idea as to prices of living, I will state </line>
         <line>a few facts, which have already come within my </line>
         <line>own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, </line>
         <line>thirteen miles from New York. It is on the </line>
         <line>road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the </line>
         <line>day passes without a carriage of some sort offer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing for going thither, and to go by the regular </line>
         <line>stage costs three shillings. Mind, I shall al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ways speak in English money, when I do not </line>
         <line>speak of dollars. We lodge and board in </line>
         <line>this inn, have each a bed-room and good </line>
         <line>bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; </line>
         <line>we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. </line>
         <line>– We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs, </line>
         <line>for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever </line>
         <line>sa), crackers, sweet cakes ; and when I say </line>
         <line>that we have such and such things, I do not </line>
         <line>mean that we get them for show, or just enough </line>
         <line>to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg, but a </line>
         <line>dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; </line>
         <line>but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and cof<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle </line>
         <line>nut, but in good thumping pieces. For dinner, </line>
         <line>we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; aspara<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle </line>
         <line>of May). The supper is like the breakfast, with </line>
         <line>preserved peaches and other things. And with </line>
         <line>all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the </line>
         <line>kindest and most obliging treatment, on the part </line>
         <line>of the landlord and landlady, and their sons and </line>
         <line>daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week </line>
         <line>each. In England the same food and drink and </line>
         <line>lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same </line>
         <line>sum every day. But there are two things which </line>
         <line>no money can purchase any where. The first is, </line>
         <line>no grumbling on the part of the landlady, except </line>
         <line>on account of our eating and drinking too little ; </line>
         <line>and the other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fasten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the </line>
         <line>door, to a house which is full of valuable things </line>
         <line>of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things </line>
         <line>much more carelessly than we should do in our </line>
         <line>own house in any part of England. Here, then </line>
         <line>are we able to live at an inn, one of the most </line>
         <line>respectable in the whole country, at the rate of </line>
         <line>fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a common </line>
         <line>farming man is not much short of that sum. </line>

         <line>The authenticity of the following details of the </line>
         <line>miseries endured by some German emigrants </line>
         <line>proceeding from Amsterdam to America is, we </line>
         <line>are told, guaranteed ; otherwise they are almost </line>
         <line>too shocking to admit to belief : </line>

         <line>"Libson, Nov. 4 </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"We have just been witnesses here of an </line>
         <line>event which has renewed those gloomy reflexions </line>
         <line>which the friends of humanity have indulged ever </line>
         <line>since the commencement of the emigration from </line>
         <line>Germany and Switzerland to America. We have </line>
         <line>deplored the error which led so great a number </line>
         <line>of unhappy persons to expartiate themselves in </line>
         <line>the hope of finding a happier lot upon the shores </line>
         <line>of the new world. But it is less to the blindness </line>
         <line>of the victims of this error, than to the abomi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nable speculations of cupidity that we are to </line>
         <line>attribute these numerous emigrations. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"the misery of the people of Germany and </line>
         <line>Switzerland, occasioned by a superabundance of </line>
         <line>population, and by the bad harvests of late years, </line>
         <line>serves for aliment to the avarice of certain men, </line>
         <line>who seek to establish criminal projects upon </line>
         <line>bases almost as obnoxious as those of the former </line>
         <line>slave trade. Such calculations deserve the atten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of Governments, and it is with this view that </line>
         <line>we think is our duty to make known the fate of </line>
         <line>an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amster<sh/>

         <line>them to such place in America as it shall please me, and </line>
         <line>wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it </line>
         <line>may suit me to sail."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"These horrible conditions were signed by </line>
         <line>300 passengers. They had contracted with the </line>
         <line>Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed </line>
         <line>first to Baltimore. She in the worst state </line>
         <line>when she sailed from Amsterdam, and in de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fiance of the clauses of the contract, by which </line>
         <line>the Captain had engaged to feed them properly </line>
         <line>during the voyage, he had not even embarked </line>
         <line>the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after </line>
         <line>62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon </line>
         <line>the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and </line>
         <line>famine had already made frightful ravages. It </line>
         <line>was at the end of that time, and in this deplo </line>
         <line>rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, </line>
         <line>near Lisbon. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the </line>
         <line>passengers had been reduced to the greatest mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sery, not more by the small quantity than by the </line>
         <line>bad quality of the provisions. The water was </line>
         <line>gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So </line>
         <line>much had they been wasted, that forty had al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ready died of famine. Among the rest there </line>
         <line>were a great many sick, some of who have died </line>
         <line>since their arrival in Portugal. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The situation of the vessel had at first given </line>
         <line>great alarm to our Council of Health, who, ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>prehensive of contagion, were for an instant fear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful that it would be necessary to force her out </line>
         <line>to sea. That would have been a misery so much </line>
         <line>the more formidable, because the ship was not in </line>
         <line>a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly </line>
         <line>have perished. Happily this was deemed unne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gency of Lisbon determined that provisions and </line>
         <line>other succours should be furnished at the ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pence of the State. All the Consuls were most </line>
         <line>active and benevolent in affording assistance. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Such was the result of the expedition. </line>
         <line>Many others have, no doubt, answered as little </line>
         <line>the expectations of those who, seduced by de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceitful promises have emigrated to America in </line>
         <line>search of happiness which they could not find, </line>
         <line>abandoning their country, their parents, and </line>
         <line>their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with </line>
         <line>106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the </line>
         <line>same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said </line>
         <line>here that there is a company in Holland which </line>
         <line>has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. </line>
         <line>It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if </line>
         <line>they reach their destination, they are soon con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in </line>
         <line>countries where these emigrations are excited, </line>
         <line>to insert the article relative to the charter par<sh/>

         <line>bell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, </line>

         <line>formation I can yet give you is, that the exploring </line>

         <line>about 100 miles ; in this short distance both par<sh/>

            <small_caps>Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard</small_caps>–On Friday </line>
         <line>night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place </line>
         <line>was thrown into the greatest consternation, by </line>
         <line>the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, </line>
         <line>the beating of drums, and the firing of the men </line>
         <line>of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire hav<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing broken out in the house belonging to the </line>
         <line>steam engine erected for carrying on the new </line>
         <line>works situated in the southern part of the dock- </line>
         <line>yard, near the kilns used for burning cement </line>
         <line>stone. The most serious apprehensions were </line>
         <line>entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and </line>
         <line>what was more distressing to the feelings of the </line>
         <line>spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, </line>
         <line>which, from the pressure of the times and want </line>
         <line>of employment, is crowded with many unfortu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nate individuals. Providence, however, averted </line>
         <line>the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock </line>
         <line>we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames </line>
         <line>subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. </line>
         <line>No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but </line>
         <line>one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker </line>
         <line>of the Northumberland, and the officers of that </line>
         <line>ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and </line>
         <line>Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, </line>
         <line>with the military officers and soldiers of the gar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter </line>
         <line>were under arms the whole time, and were of </line>
         <line>great service in keeping off the spectators. The </line>
         <line>inhabitants of the twon were at one time under </line>
         <line>serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far </line>
         <line>from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of </line>
         <line>Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the </line>
         <line>landlady of the house had but recently lain in, </line>
         <line>and was removed on the first alarm being given. </line>

         </line>
         <line>tends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, </line>
         <line>was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, </line>
         <line>which it is suspected arose from carlessness – </line>
         <line>The damage, however, has not been so great as </line>
         <line>was at first expected, and which it might have been </line>
         <line>but for the prompt and effectual assistance that </line>
         <line>was given – <i>Sheerness, January</i> 11 </line>

         <line>New York, Nov. 27. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Nothing scarcely can be conceived more </line>
         <line>distressing than the situation of an unfriend<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed stranger arrived here, from across the At<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lantic, without the means of helping himself, </line>
         <line>and without even enough of acquaintance with </line>
         <line>the men and things about him to enable him </line>
         <line>to judge what path he should take to secure him </line>
         <line>the miseries of absolute want. Such, how<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever, is actually the situation of hundres who </line>
         <line>annually land on our shores. To provide for </line>
         <line>those forlorn beings, several attempts have been </line>
         <line>made by associations of humane individuals here, </line>
         <line>but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising </line>
         <line>as that of which an account here follows: – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>At a meeting of Irishmen, and descendents of Irishmen, </line>
         <line>held at Harmony Hall, on Tuesday the 25th instant, for </line>
         <line>the purpose of promoting a Settlement of Irish Emi<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>
            <small_caps>WM. Sampson</small_caps>, Secretary ; </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, </line>
         <line>the circular previously issues on this subject was </line>
         <line>read by the Secretary : – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>
            <small_caps>Circular</small_caps>
         </line>
         <line>It is a sentiment long felt, and often express<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed, that something should be undertaken on be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>hald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Without any fixed destination, they remain in </line>
         <line>the sea port, until beocming victims of bad </line>
         <line>counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and </line>
         <line>honest energies with which they left their native </line>
         <line>land, and suffer worse than shipwreck in their </line>
         <line>moral qualities. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Government of this great Republic is well </line>
         <line>aware of the advantage to be derived from so </line>
         <line>great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully </line>
         <line>directed and employed–and of adding to the </line>
         <line>nation's strength, men whose attachment to the </line>
         <line>institutions of this country is assured by so many </line>
         <line>ties. But it is in the order of things, that some </line>
         <line>of the friends, particularly the countrymen of </line>
         <line>these emigrants, who have been some time esta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blished and known, should come forward to at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>test the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of </line>
         <line>the enterprise. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>If his has not been done sooner, it is because </line>
         <line>every advance in social improvement must come </line>
         <line>in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion, </line>
         <line>and the voice of the times that now speak. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It has been remarked that among the lands </line>
         <line>nows open for sale and settlement, there are some </line>
         <line>tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, </line>
         <line>where the Irish emigrant, with the instruments </line>
         <line>to which his hands are accustomed, and in a cli<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mate congenial to his habits, might procure to </line>
         <line>himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, </line>
         <line>in a few years, be able to repay with gratitude </line>
         <line>the benefits conferred on him. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We, whose names are undersigned, have met </line>
         <line>to consult upon the means of promoting some </line>
         <line>establishment that might be a rallying point for </line>
         <line>the distressed, and give to the wanderer a habi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tation and a home. We have thought of no bet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter way than to address, by this circular, the </line>
         <line>friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-ope<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ration might give most weight to the measure, </line>
         <line>and to submit, whether it might not be advisable </line>
         <line>to join all our efforts, and petition Congress ear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>able track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject to such conditions and modifications as the </line>
         <line>Government may see most fitting. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>to the Government we would offer no decep<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive, delusive, or precarious motive, rather chu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sing to make its wisdom, benignity, and patriot<sh/>

         <line>ism, the anchor of our hope. </line>

      <p>
         <line>We request of our, if you approve of our sen<sh/>

         <line>timent and of our project, to advance and pro<sh/>

         <line>vidual signatures, to a petition to the effect sta<sh/>

         </line>
         <line>quested by the gentlemen who called this meet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing, to explain the objects for which it was con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>venued ; that it could not be necessary to expa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tiate before those he was now addressin, on the </line>
         <line>situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ire<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land ; it was at present one of unqualified mise<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try, partly occasioned by their local oppressions, </line>
         <line>and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; </line>
         <line>it compelled them to fly to these shores in such </line>
         <line>numbers, and under the pressure of so great po<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>verty, that the most active individual benevo<sh/>

         <line>reasonable time, the means of permanent settle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. The consequence was, that many of </line>

         <line>this county, or forced by want to become noxi<sh/>

         <line>better their condition in this more fortunate and </line>
         <line>favoured land–to the political institutions of </line>
         <line>which they were also more strongly attached. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A very painful reflection on these circumstan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ces had suggested to come gentlemen then pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sent the hope that the general Government might </line>
         <line>be induced, by a strong and united application, </line>
         <line>to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms </line>
         <line>liberal and bountiful, so that an asylum might be </line>
         <line>formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, </line>
         <line>who would gladly fly from famine and persecu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion to a spot where the sweat of their brows fall<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing on a fertile soil would yield them a rich har<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where </line>
         <line>they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of </line>
         <line>that republication liberty they loved. The time </line>
         <line>for making such an application seemed auspici<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ous ; party asperities had softened fown, and </line>
         <line>probably few would now be led by political pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>judices to give it opposition. Neither was it un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>precedented ; a favour nearly similar had been </line>
         <line>granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers </line>
         <line>from Switzerland. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is true we could not forth a pretence </line>
         <line>like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and </line>
         <column/>
         <line>we would not succeed by practising any delusion. </line>
         <line>We could offer nothing but an immediate accession </line>
         <line>of industrious and hardy settlers, who in a conge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nial soil and climate would become enthusiastically </line>
         <line>attached to the country and the Government </line>
         <line>from whence they derived all their blessings, and, </line>
         <line>wherever they were found, would form a barrier </line>
         <line>against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly </line>
         <line>be expected from the generous sympathy which </line>
         <line>the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had every<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>where excited in the United States, and from </line>
         <line>the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted </line>
         <line>Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might </line>
         <line>also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not </line>
         <line>only those that in the ordinary course of events </line>
         <line>would arrive here, whose usefulness is lost by </line>
         <line>the want of proper direction, and who become </line>
         <line>burdens or scourges to our cities, would be res<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cued and placed in a situation where all the ener<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gies of active and enterprising minds would be </line>
         <line>serviceable to themselves and the community ; </line>
         <line>but also the very fact that such an asylum was </line>
         <line>open and accessible, would infinitely increase </line>
         <line>the amount of emigration from Ireland, and peo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ple our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. </line>
         <line>The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is </line>
         <line>in the Illinois territory–it has been lately pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the </line>
         <line>ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be </line>
         <line>brought into market (at least to any extent) for </line>
         <line>many years ; but if Congress listen to our ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plication, and grant to the settlers an extended </line>
         <line>credit, Government will receive payment for the </line>
         <line>land probably as soon as if it were suffered to </line>
         <line>remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale </line>
         <line>came round. A large body of settlers will be </line>
         <line>enabled to grow rich during the time that the </line>
         <line>land would otherwise be waste and unproduc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive, and the value of all the contiguous proper<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty belonging to the United States would be ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pidly and immensely increased, to say nothing </line>
         <line>of the advantages resulting from the strength of </line>
         <line>such a settled frontier. All these considerations </line>
         <line>may be strongly urged by men, who can most </line>
         <line>truly say they are actuated by no views of </line>
         <line>personal speculation or emolument ; who are </line>
         <line>willing to enter into all the labour of procuring </line>
         <line>settlers and organising the establishment, with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out any prospect of gain, or even compensation, </line>
         <line>except as to what may be necessary for defray<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the expences of the undertaking ; and who </line>
         <line>are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy </line>
         <line>all the advantages which Government may be </line>
         <line>willing to grant. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>These are our views–we conceive that they </line>
         <line>may be realized, if supported by an united and </line>
         <line>active co-operation of those who think like us </line>
         <line>in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, </line>
         <line>desirous of adopting and pointing out to others </line>
         <line>what seems to be the best mode of giving system </line>
         <line>to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of </line>
         <line>societies totally divested of all party or political </line>
         <line>feelings, and directing the attention only to this </line>
         <line>object. There are already a sufficient number </line>
         <line>of political institutions in every State, in which </line>
         <line>the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they </line>
         <line>may) can act on them to their fullest extent. </line>
         <line>Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather </line>
         <line>consecrated places, in which, when we meet, we </line>
         <line>lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers </line>
         <line>in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our </line>
         <line>common worship. They are consecrated to </line>
         <line>every man amongst us, by the purity of their </line>
         <line>object, by our earliest recollections, by our un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>broken affection, and our strongest sympathies– </line>
         <line>by the unextinguished love of our native land, </line>
         <line>for which most of us have already renounced all </line>
         <line>sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; </line>
         <line>which we offer as a solemn pledge to the coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try of our adoption, that our hearts will be al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ways alive, from temperament as well as prin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciple, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that </line>
         <line>those amongst us who have pledged their faith </line>
         <line>to her, however they may seem to differ on some </line>
         <line>minor political subjects, will always be found </line>
         <line>firmly ranged and united under the same ban<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ners, and forming one phalanx whenever her </line>
         <line>more important interests are concerned. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which </line>
         <line>being severally put, were carried with some </line>
         <line>slight amendments as follow :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of </line>
         <line>Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the </line>
         <line>Illinois territory, to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. </line>
         <line>2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing descrip<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, who shall, on or before the second day of December </line>
         <line>next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five </line>
         <line>dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said So<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciety, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to </line>
         <line>one hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at li<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>berty to elect their own officers and no person shall after<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wards be admitted except by ballot. </line>
         <line>3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen, and </line>
         <line>the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of </line>
         <line>the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of cor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>responding and co-operating with that which is about to be </line>
         <line>formed in this city. </line>
         <line>4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will short<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mittee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a me<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>morial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of the </line>
         <line>Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such </line>
         <line>measures as they may think expedient for promoting and ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>celebrating the organization of that Society. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Em<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>met's motion, expressed, in handsome terms, how </line>
         <line>much he was gratified by the invitation to attend, </line>
         <line>had given him the opportunity of claiming </line>
         <line>his title of descendent of an Irishman. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A Committee was then appointed, pursuant </line>
         <line>to the fourth resolution, the number being, upon </line>
         <line>motion and discussion, augmented to twenty<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>one. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>

         <line>Doyle, James Hayes. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A subscription paper being then opened, a </line>
         <line>number of those present subscribed their names </line>
         <line>and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and </line>
         <line>became members of the association. Those per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons who wish to become original members may </line>
         <line>do so by signing their names and paying their </line>

         <line>cember, pursuant to the second resolution. </line>

      <p>
         <line>After the meeting was adjourned, the Com<sh/>

            <i>their Correspondents in this quarter.</i>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>templation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into </line>
         <line>Great Britain and Ireland, from the British North American </line>
         <line>Provinces, equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign </line>
         <line>Timber in 1813 will be further suspended. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encourage<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] </line>
         <line>bring us [?] at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish </line>
         <line>the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], </line>
         <line>and that on very moderate terms ; but, in the event of Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence, </line>
         <line>that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans, </line>
         <line>besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring </line>
         <line>Provinces. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother </line>
         <line>country, upon trial, will be found delusive ; to prove this, many </line>
         <line>obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists, all the </line>
         <line>Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ire<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky </line>
         <line>an article as Timber, and the import of so ponderous an article </line>
         <line>as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects </line>
         <line>certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any </line>
         <line>benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on </line>
         <line>the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be </line>
         <line>denied that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid </line>
         <line>on Foreign Timber, they (the Foreigners) were not only the </line>
         <line>carriers, but would not accept an ounce of British Manufac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ture in payment for their TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] </line>
         <line>which was so much in demand, that 28s. was given for a [?]. </line>
         <line>Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what </line>
         <line>is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many valuable set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that would go to the </line>
         <line>States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when </line>
         <line>they would of accessity[?] become our enemies. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tern countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was </line>
         <line>derived, the merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters </line>
         <line>were not only alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The </line>
         <line>Baltic is shut[?], what shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? </line>
         <line>They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could </line>
         <line>supply them ; they made the experiment, they were not disap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If there<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore, in time of war, Britain has took to her colonies for a sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for </line>
         <line>us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected, </line>
         <line>when blessed with peace."</line>

         <line>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft </line>
         <line>of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on </line>
         <line>the resolutions adopted in the province of Nia<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gara, where some discontent has been manifested. </line>
         <line>The first part is as follows:– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent </line>
         <line>of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, </line>
         <line>&amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper </line>
         <line>Canada </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>
            <i>May it please your Royal Highness,</i>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper </line>
         <line>Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their </line>
         <line>loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their </line>
         <line>Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth </line>
         <line>has not been told. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed </line>
         <line>to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernment of the United States had been long concerting the </line>
         <line>invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had </line>
         <line>been long masked under other designs ; and at last the ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless chil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dren of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the </line>
         <line>weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded </line>
         <line>those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of hu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>manity, and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from </line>
         <line>their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained </line>
         <line>dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they </line>
         <line>rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to </line>
         <line>them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the </line>
         <line>rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American </line>
         <line>standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a hand<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of </line>
         <line>victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cond year of war saw Canada contending with yet little as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sistance from the parent state. The second year of the war </line>
         <line>saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more deter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their </line>
         <line>homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of </line>
         <line>revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; </line>
         <line>still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it </line>
         <line>burn with patriotism and loyalty. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for </line>
         <line>now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace </line>
         <line>was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"It is now more than three years since there was an end </line>
         <line>of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother </line>
         <line>country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been </line>
         <line>made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernment transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and </line>
         <line>are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications </line>
         <line>are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too </line>
         <line>shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please </line>
         <line>your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and </line>
         <line>grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully </line>
         <line>assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of </line>
         <line>most important truths ; who are well assured of the gene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rous disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that </line>
         <line>British subjects should every where share equally you pater<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nal regard an affection. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of </line>
         <line>the province to see, even during the war, which afforded </line>
         <line>such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports </line>
         <line>went home highly rating the merits of regular troops, </line>
         <line>while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set </line>
         <line>down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here </line>
         <line>were often stigmatised by British officers, ignorant of </line>
         <line>human character, and still more so of circumstances </line>
         <line>which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so </line>
         <line>with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Cana<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dian worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in </line>
         <line>the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the </line>
         <line>genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and </line>
         <line>brave. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain </line>
         <line>to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary </line>
         <line>to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with </line>
         <line>other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tween British subjects here and at home, to influence the </line>
         <line>conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vince. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada </line>
         <line>suffered grievously during the war in their property, and </line>
         <line>many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on </line>
         <line>this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were au<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thenticated, and there was every reason to expect that re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>compence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has fol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lowed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind </line>
         <line>a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals </line>
         <line>of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public </line>
         <line>calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives </line>
         <line>for Government should not be disgusted with finding Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernment regardless of those very principles which it is in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tended to sustain. The people of this province are well </line>
         <line>aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard </line>
         <line>with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief </line>
         <line>should be afford from thence. Canada contains within it<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>self ample means of exonerating Government from the </line>
         <line>claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your </line>
         <line>Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now </line>
         <line>justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie </line>
         <line>here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit </line>
         <line>of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims </line>
         <line>of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums </line>
         <line>could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and </line>
         <line>the increase of revenue to Britain. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, </line>
         <line>and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of </line>
         <line>your Royal Highness. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The young men of this province, who were armed in </line>
         <line>its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of </line>
         <line>their commanders, that land would be granted them as a </line>
         <line>reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated ; </line>
         <line>and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parlia<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face </line>
         <line>of established British principles, that militia should pass </line>
         <line>beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience </line>
         <line>to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with </line>
         <line>alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater part of them had </line>
         <line>been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and </line>
         <line>the land is unjudtly withheld."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The petition further states that such ingratitude, </line>
         <line>such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not </line>
         <line>exist without extraordinary influences, and it </line>
         <line>recommends most important changes equally for </line>
         <line>the glory of the throne, and benefit of the </line>
         <line>subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came </line>
         <line>some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gratitude, the the home Ministers wisely im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed restriction on the Land Council of Upper </line>
         <line>Canada. It seems, however, that all this was </line>
         <line>insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has </line>
         <line>grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nada, it is now said, pines in comparative de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cay, and that discontent and poverty are expe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rienced in a land supremely blessed with the </line>
         <line>gifts of nature. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is insisted that the immediate interfe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rence of his Royal Highness might do </line>
         <line>much to remove the evils which spring from the </line>
         <line>system of patronage and favouritism, and it as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>serts that the interposition of the British Par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>liament is more imperiously required. It con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cludes as follows:–" Deeply penetrated with </line>
         <line>these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to </line>
         <line>have changes speedily effected, the loyal </line>
         <line>subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper </line>

         <line>next, so materially changes the commerce of the United </line>

         <line>those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act </line>
         <line>should at this time be determined. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>According to the term used un ther the first section of the </line>
         <line>act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories </line>
         <line>in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must </line>
         <line>be considered as closed against vessels of the United States, </line>
         <line>to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry </line>
         <line>on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is </line>
         <line>now, or shall be, carried on in British vessels between the </line>
         <line>ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the </line>

         <line>Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ticles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those </line>
         <line>islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the </line>
         <line>intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are </line>

         <line>vessels of the United States. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the </line>

         <line>with cargoes. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The form of the bond required by the second section of </line>

            <small_caps>Emigration to America</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Our paper of Thursday last contained a gene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ral view of some of the most popular publications </line>
         <line>on the subject of emigration, and we shall now </line>
         <line>endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the </line>
         <line>good and evil which is likely to befal those who </line>
         <line>embark in this hazardous adventure. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There is one important fact which we gather </line>
         <line>from all the accounts of America, whether writ<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ten for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, </line>
         <line>that there is a great demand for labour, and that </line>
         <line>wages are high, and this effect is necessarily </line>
         <line>produced y the vast space of fertile and unoc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cupied territory which lies westward of the </line>
         <line>United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is </line>
         <line>this vacant territory which is the true spring of </line>
         <line>this American community. Here is the grand out<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>let for the superflouous population both of the east<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate </line>
         <line>this waste there is a constant demand for new la<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer </line>
         <line>lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>comes in his turn a purchaser of land from the sa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vings which he accumulates. If labour should be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>come more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is </line>
         <line>the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stant demand for labour in the western districts </line>
         <line>regulates its general price throughout the United </line>
         <line>States. In these circumstrances it is clear that </line>
         <line>a labourer, provided he can reach this advan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tageous market for his labour, will unquestionably </line>
         <line>improve his condition. But herein lies the dif<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficulty. A labourer has seldon the means of </line>
         <line>of subsitence so far beforehand as to enable him to </line>
         <line>undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters </line>
         <line>upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he </line>
         <line>is liable to starve before he can transport him<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>self to his ultimate destination, or he is forced to </line>
         <line>contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations </line>
         <line>little short of servitude, under the weight of </line>
         <line>which he is grievously oppressed. These, then </line>
         <line>form strong objections to emigrations in the case </line>
         <line>of those who are stinted to their means ; but </line>
         <line>where these objections can be surmounted, those </line>
         <line>who can transport their labour from the over<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stocked market of Europe to the understocked </line>
         <line>market of America, will unquestionably dispose </line>
         <line>of it to better advantage ; but if they have not </line>
         <line>the means, they may as furely fail in the at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tempt, and draw upon themselves aggravated mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sery and want. As to the consequences of emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration to this country, we hold them rather to be </line>
         <line>beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>count for the very absurd alarm which has been </line>
         <line>propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, </line>
         <line>that every country is overcrowded with labourers, </line>
         <line>who cannot find employment ; and is it not mani<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of </line>
         <line>these will make more room for the labourers that </line>
         <line>remain – that the loss of those useless hands </line>
         <line>will rather be a relief to the body politic, and </line>
         <line>will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through </line>
         <line>all its parts? That these effects will follow from </line>
         <line>emigration in this or in any other country in </line>
         <line>Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer, </line>
         <line>if he can afford the expence of the jounrye, will re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceive higher wages in America than in this coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try, is equally clear. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There is another class of adventurers who </line>
         <line>may possibly improve their circumstances by </line>
         <line>emigration, although this is not so certain, name<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly, farmers with a moderate capital. An allot<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of land may be purchased in the back parts </line>
         <line>of America at the Government price of two dol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to </line>
         <line>but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and </line>
         <line>acts with proper judgement and skill, may </line>
         <line>undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure </line>
         <line>of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions from the eastern states, the country being </line>
         <line>quickly settled all around him, his property is </line>
         <line>daily improving in value. But a want of judgement </line>
         <line>in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the </line>
         <line>land after it is purchased, may involve him in ir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>recoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these </line>
         <line>hazards no little discrimination and prudence is </line>
         <line>necessary. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Such are some of the most striking advantages </line>
         <line>of emigration, and we shall now state some of </line>
         <line>its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, </line>
         <line>is the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of </line>
         <line>subsisting until the land which is purchased yields </line>
         <line>its first produce. The country is partly open </line>
         <line>ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vered with almost boundless forests. A settle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment in the woods requires incredible labour to </line>
         <line>clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, </line>
         <line>and this herculean task naturally devolves on the </line>
         <line>head of the family, who is forced during the day </line>
         <line>to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of fell<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for </line>
         <line>a meal to his family. Here he must frequently </line>
         <line>sleep out in the woods ; and his body, exhausted </line>
         <line>with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold </line>
         <line>dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his </line>
         <line>health declines, and it is obvious that his family, </line>
         <line>deprived even for a single day of his exertions, </line>
         <line>must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. </line>
         <line>In many parts the country which is marked out </line>
         <line>for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in particu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lar the banks of all the navigable rivers, which </line>
         <line>afford the most eligible settlements both in point </line>
         <line>of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most </line>
         <line>fatal maladies. The same causes which produce </line>
         <line>fertility produce disease. The overflowing of </line>
         <line>the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, </line>
         <line>fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; </line>
         <line>but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>der a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as </line>
         <line>the deposits which they leave are favourable to </line>
         <line>the soil. Hence the many minute directions </line>
         <line>which are given to all emigrants in regard to </line>
         <line>their health. In a letter contained in the Emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>grant's Guide, we have the following advice to </line>
         <line>those who are descending the Ohio : " If the </line>
         <line>weather becomes warm, guard well against the </line>
         <line>smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in </line>
         <line>the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the </line>
         <line>havoc, and I believed it not till then." Again it </line>
         <line>is observed, " Let nothing tempt you to fish in </line>
         <line>warm weather, immediately on changing your </line>
         <line>climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison."/&gt;</line>
         <line>To a European emigran the climate must be, of </line>
         <line>course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore </line>
         <line>lose his health, or he must be continually </line>
         <line>tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which </line>
         <line>makes it a question whether it is worth having on </line>
         <line>such terms. Such are the hardships through which, </line>
         <line>if he has strength to endure them, he at length </line>
         <line>emerges into ease and independence. These hard<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ships, however, will no doubt be in a great mea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forehand provided the means of subsistence until </line>
         <line>he can derive regular supplies from his own </line>
         <line>land. In this case he is less laible to be </line>
         <line>dislodged from his situation by the casualties to </line>
         <line>which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – </line>
         <line>He is secured against the hardships of a first </line>
         <line>settlement, and is more certain of attaining </line>
         <column/>
         <line>the wished for object of ease and affluence – </line>
         <line>To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion presents a fair chance of a permanent settle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, provided it is gone about with ordinary </line>
         <line>caution, and the necessary degree of energy be </line>
         <line>exerted to insure success. But it is a gross de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in </line>
         <line>the United States, or that mankind exist there on </line>
         <line>any more favourable terms than in this country, </line>
         <line>and those who set out on any such visionary </line>
         <line>schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappoint<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. With regard to other classes of society, it </line>
         <line>does not appear that they will improve their con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dition by emigration to America ; there is no de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mand for clerks or professional men of any sort, </line>
         <line>and no merchant has any thing to expect by remo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ving his capital to the United States. In the back </line>
         <line>settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters </line>
         <line>to teach the ordinary branches of education, and </line>
         <line>several emigrants of this class have met with </line>
         <line>good encouragement. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it </line>
         <line>is apparent, from all the best information on the </line>
         <line>subject, that a person long resident in this coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try would change for the worse by an emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion to the United States. He would, in the </line>
         <line>first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from </line>
         <line>the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat </line>
         <line>of summer, the thermometer frequently standing </line>
         <line>at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and </line>
         <line>broiling sun, and very little abatement of this ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sessive heat being experienced through the night. </line>
         <line>His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, </line>
         <line>though unsettled climate of this country, </line>
         <line>runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, </line>
         <line>and at all events he must suffer extremely in </line>
         <line>his enjoyments and in his spirit from this </line>
         <line>cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the man<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ners of the people in the back parts be found </line>
         <line>very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all </line>
         <line>hands, both by those who are favourable and </line>
         <line>those who are unfavourable to the Americans, </line>
         <line>that if there is not, as in Europe, gross igno<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rance and debasement on the one hand, neither </line>
         <line>is there on the other any thing much exalted </line>
         <line>above the ordinary level. But the inferences </line>
         <line>which arise from this established fact are strongly </line>
         <line>in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and </line>
         <line>ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corrup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions in the disgust which it excites : such </line>
         <line>examples are not so potent to debase, as ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>amples of a different sort are to purify and </line>
         <line>exalt. There is little risk that society will </line>
         <line>be contaminated by what is low and deba<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sed ; but on the other hand, there is a cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tainty that what is exalted and illustrious in li<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terature, science, taste, accomplishments, or </line>
         <line>fashion, will exercise a powerful influence on </line>
         <line>the general state of manners. We naturally </line>
         <line>copy what we admire, and those great and shin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing examples constitute a standard to which </line>
         <line>the whole system of life and manners has a </line>
         <line>tacit reference. In the United States they have </line>
         <line>no such models – they do not aim at so high a </line>
         <line>standard, and taste and manners are therefore </line>
         <line>necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – </line>
         <line>Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>treme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and </line>
         <line>Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great </line>
         <line>partiality to this country, draws a contrast be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tween the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of </line>
         <line>the United States, in which he places this vice </line>
         <line>of the American manners in strong colours ; and </line>
         <line>he adds, as his reason for this, that they have </line>
         <line>no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements </line>
         <line>of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the </line>
         <line>country, as models of taste and neatness for the </line>
         <line>inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that </line>
         <line>we may trace other defects in their manners, </line>
         <line>namely, that they have no proper models on which </line>
         <line>to form themselves. Hence, excepting in the </line>
         <line>principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all </line>
         <line>the information we have received on the subject, </line>
         <line>that society has not reach the same degree of </line>
         <line>refinement as in this country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain </line>
         <line>would also feel the disavantages of Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>can society strong in this, that here, in so </line>
         <line>closely peopled a community, surrounded with </line>
         <line>all sorts of refinements, life is assisted by such </line>
         <line>a variety of helps, that it glides down the </line>
         <line>smooth stream of comfort and convenience, with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out ever meeting with a single interruption. It </line>
         <line>is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a </line>
         <line>society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all </line>
         <line>the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of </line>
         <line>thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on </line>
         <line>foot new devices for the common good. We </line>
         <line>are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, </line>
         <line>because, like other advantages, they are familiar </line>
         <line>to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine </line>
         <line>that they are inherent in the natural constitution </line>
         <line>of things. But when we are suddenly trans<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>planted into a new community, abounding in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deed in subsistence, but deficient in all com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are </line>
         <line>practised – where the inhabitants are so wide<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly dispersed, that their common exertions </line>
         <line>cannot be made available for the common </line>
         <line>good, we find life interrupted at every turn. In </line>
         <line>our former society, if we had not the previous </line>
         <line>secret of transmuting all things into gold, we </line>
         <line>had at least the power of transmuting gold into </line>
         <line>every thing else. But here the power of money </line>
         <line>is limited. We must indeed pay for services, </line>
         <line>but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go </line>
         <line>on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty </line>
         <line>incommodities, which in this country would be </line>
         <line>remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceivable how much inconvenience and discom<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fort and real unhappiness may spring from this </line>
         <line>cause. In this country, by long habit and prac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rice and continual improvement, every thing has </line>
         <line>fallen into its right place – each individual has a </line>
         <line>separate task assigned him in the joint task of </line>
         <line>labouring for the general benefit – and the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dustry of all, however variously directed, tends </line>
         <line>to one common end. There is a perfect unity </line>
         <line>of effort. We all labour in common – we com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bine our efforts that they may yield the largest </line>
         <line>possible produce, and this produce is accurately </line>
         <line>shared among the various members of the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>munity, each receiving the share to which his </line>
         <line>labour entitles him. Such is substantially the </line>
         <line>process by which commerce diffuses the benefits </line>
         <line>of industry over every civilized community. – </line>
         <line>Money is the instrument by which this division </line>
         <line>is effected. Every one who labours has the value </line>
         <line>of his labour ascertained in money, which is a </line>
         <line>draft upon the common stock for whatever quan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; </line>
         <line>and all these complicated operations are execut<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in </line>
         <line>a community newly forming there is a want of </line>
         <line>unity and combination – all the members labour </line>
         <line>indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned </line>
         <line>him – there is a jostling and an interference with </line>
         <line>each other – and when they come to divide, </line>
         <line>some have too much, and some too little, of cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money </line>
         <column/>
         <line>will not execute its functions. Hence disorder </line>
         <line>arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, </line>
         <line>and an individual suddenly removed into this </line>
         <line>region of discomfort from the happier climate of </line>
         <line>a highly improved community, must be annoy<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy </line>
         <line>and disagreeable. He must have the same sen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, </line>
         <line>fitted up with every comfort and convenience, </line>
         <line>for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, </line>
         <line>where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances </line>
         <line>every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, </line>
         <line>that the evil of life does not consist in any sud<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>den and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a </line>
         <line>series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs conti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nually preying upon the temper. The truth of </line>
         <line>this maxim, those who emigrate from this coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try to the back woods of America, will have a </line>
         <line>good opportunity of verifying. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States </line>
         <line>of the Union constitutes another capital defect </line>
         <line>in the structure of American society. These </line>
         <line>slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, </line>
         <line>in the tyranny exercised over them, they them<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>selves are morally destroyed, while the corruption </line>
         <line>extends to the other orders of society, equally </line>
         <line>infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and </line>
         <line>debasing the general character and habits of the </line>
         <line>people. It is vain to talk of liberty while </line>
         <line>stain of tyranny so deeply infects the do<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mestic manners of a community. There can </line>
         <line>be no rational liberty unless we call that </line>
         <line>liberty which gives us the privilge of tortu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ring and oppressing our fellow creatures. To </line>
         <line>give an idea of the consequences of this dread<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a </line>
         <line>practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves </line>
         <line>into the hands of the public executioner, by </line>
         <line>whom they are unmercifully flogged at the mar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>key cross of the different towns, the streets </line>
         <line>being filled with their pietous cries. What </line>
         <line>can we think of the people where such spec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so </line>
         <line>utterly revolting to every just and enlightened </line>
         <line>feeling, that to a European it would form a strong </line>
         <line>objection to his permanent residence in that </line>
         <line>country. In all the northern states, and in some </line>
         <line>of the new states, particularly that of the </line>
         <line>Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>veral others the black form a large proportion </line>
         <line>of the population, and they are not decreasing. </line>
         <line>We know indeed that this evil is admitted in </line>
         <line>its full extent by all the American statesmen, </line>
         <line>that they lament it, but do not well see what </line>
         <line>measures can be adopted to check it. The im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but </line>
         <line>the increase of those already in the country </line>
         <line>is the great grievance, against which it is </line>
         <line>difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and </line>
         <line>oppressive treatment which slaves will always </line>
         <line>meet with wherever they exist, must tend </line>
         <line>to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the </line>
         <line>community at large. To such, therefore, as are </line>
         <line>accustomed to European society, where no such </line>
         <line>strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners, </line>
         <line>an exchange into a community where his feel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ings may be revolted by spectacles of gross cruel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty cannot be regarded as very desirable. If more </line>
         <line>imperious considerations permit, they have cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tainly a greater chance for happiness by remain<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing where the rights of nature are respected, than </line>
         <line>by removing to a society where every principle </line>
         <line>of humanity is trampled upon. </line>

      <p>
         <line>SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of 1815,
            proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself
            occasion </line>
         <line>to visit this country, I was curious to know what had been the result, especially as
            I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people
            asserting </line>
         <line>that the scheme had failed of succcess, and that the settlers were in a state of
            great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my route about
            50 miles, and </line>
         <line>spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters of the Redeau, to which a
            considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been
            conducted.– </line>
         <line>Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and
            some ill conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious
            of their rights ; </line>
         <line>but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers, and a strong
            feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good
            one of ascer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>taining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I
            constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to prove
            to correctness </line>
         <line>of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy
            of publication, you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a
            most important </line>
         <line>subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford
            satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their
            friends. The </line>
         <line>scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free
            passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came
            out ; </line>
         <line>and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada, in expectation of being
            favoured in the same way, but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100
            acres </line>
         <line>each), which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study,
            during thrre months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country, and into
            every </line>
         <line>particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very simple measures might be
            adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular
            flow into </line>
         <line>Canada, instead of being wasted, as it now is, to the great prejudice of British
            interest, over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted, this province
            would, in a very </line>
         <line>few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am, Sir,
            yours, &amp;c. </line>

            <small_caps>Convicts destined for Botany Bay.</small_caps>–It is now seven </line>
         <line>weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several </line>
         <line>others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany </line>
         <line>Bay. They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bution, put on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to </line>
         <line>land them at their place of punishment. The number on </line>
         <line>board that ship, on leaving Sheerness, was between 2 to 300, </line>
         <line>many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has </line>
         <line>been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay </line>
         <line>that has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceed<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some </line>
         <line>accident or other. She returned to Sheerness, where she now </line>
         <line>lies, and where she is likely to lie for some time, upon the pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay, </line>
         <line>however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led </line>
         <line>to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has </line>
         <line>taken place ;–so that between the suspense, and the terrible </line>
         <line>species of confinement to which they are subject, their suffer<sh/>

         <line>est concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel </line>
         <line>
            <small_caps>Erskine,</small_caps> Lord <small_caps>Erskine's</small_caps> youngest son,
            on his passage to </line>
         <line>Ceylon. He served throughout the campaigns in Spain as </line>
         <line>a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment, and be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>haved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees, </line>
         <line>where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cal Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of </line>
         <line>
            <small_caps>York</small_caps> on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's </line>
         <line>Department when the Duke of <small_caps>Wellington</small_caps> took the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mand in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June, </line>
         <line>and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo, where </line>
         <line>his station placed him in the dangerous position of being at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was </line>
         <line>either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young </line>
         <line>man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which pass<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing along the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost </line>
         <line>the use of two of his fingers, but that arm was saved. When </line>
         <line>the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse, and as he lay </line>
         <line>bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition, the Prus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he sei<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>zed his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it </line>
         <line>round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying </line>
         <line>and the dead, the Duke of <small_caps>Wellington</small_caps> being then close by </line>
         <line>him who desired he might carried to his tent. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he </line>
         <line>must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great </line>
         <line>Commander, as he was immediately recommended by him for </line>
         <line>the rank of Major, though a very young officer, and in a year </line>
         <line>afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with the ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had then </line>

         <line>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we </line>
         <line>have advices from thence of the 4th September, three </line>
         <line>days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we </line>
         <line>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on </line>
         <line>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at </line>
         <line>Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>specting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His </line>
         <line>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, </line>
         <line>where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in </line>
         <line>the most afflicting state, and great fears were entertain<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed for her recovery. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, </line>
         <line>is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. </line>
         <line>They accompanied his grace to North America, and </line>
         <line>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the </line>
         <line>first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles </line>
         <line>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty </line>
         <line>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, </line>
         <line>Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, </line>
         <line>Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English ho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke </line>
         <line>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of </line>
         <line>Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was </line>
         <line>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by caus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and </line>
         <line>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by </line>
         <line>his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General </line>
         <line>in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower </line>
         <line>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of </line>
         <line>the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. </line>
         <line>–His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his uncle, </line>
         <line>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 </line>
         <line>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom </line>
         <line>he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them </line>
         <line>now living, except his third son, Henry Adam, R. N. </line>
         <line>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into </line>
         <line>Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace </line>
         <line>was distinguished early in life by a duel with His </line>
         <line>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an </line>
         <line>open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>affected manners, qualities which were particularly con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>spicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest </line>
         <line>son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. </line>
         <line>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active ser<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and </line>
         <line>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the </line>
         <line>City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<sh/>

         <line>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from </line>

         <line>I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to com<sh/>

         <line>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles </line>
         <line>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly </line>
         <line>sensible of his situation, and gave himself up from the </line>
         <line>first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by </line>
         <line>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<sh/>

            <small_caps>Emigration to America</small_caps>. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In answer to the remarks which appeared in </line>
         <line>our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration </line>
         <line>to America, and to the statements there given </line>
         <line>of the disadvantages which emigrants from </line>
         <line>this country might expect to meet with, we have </line>
         <line>received a very abusive letter from an anony<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mous correspondent, who appears very angry, </line>
         <line>and, like most other angry men, seems more </line>
         <line>anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sign any good reason for it. His first cause of </line>
         <line>quarrel is, that we have stated the general want </line>
         <line>of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the </line>
         <line>back parts of the United States. For this we </line>
         <line>have the authority of almost every traveller who </line>
         <line>has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck </line>
         <line>on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and </line>
         <line>' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, </line>
         <line>' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' ry many individual exceptions. I have written </line>
         <line>' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, </line>
         <line>' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth </line>
         <line>' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too </line>
         <line>' often in person, is neglected to a degree which </line>
         <line>' is very revolting to an Englishman. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a </line>
         <line>' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; </line>
         <line>' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn </line>
         <line>' logs for a framed building, and that again for </line>
         <line>' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits </line>
         <line>' have been unconsciously retained. Many have </line>
         <line>' already been quitted, and one by one they will </line>
         <line>' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now </line>
         <line>' in the cities of the eastern states. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which </line>
         <line>' are also made us of as places of worship, in </line>
         <line>' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating </line>
         <line>' ever since they were built. What reverence </line>
         <line>' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of </line>
         <line>' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The </line>
         <line>' people who are content to assemble in them </line>
         <line>' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad </line>
         <line>' public example. It is said that to clean those </line>
         <line>' places is the office of no one. But why is no </line>
         <line>' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred </line>
         <line>' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails </line>
         <line>' through such a community?' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the </line>
         <line>' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' liness about the homsteads, and particularly </line>
         <line>' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck </line>
         <line>' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast </line>
         <line>' with the homesteads and cottages which he left </line>
         <line>' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the </line>
         <line>reasons for this. When the first settlers took </line>
         <line>possession of the country, the ' example of neat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were </line>
         <line>' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as </line>
         <line>' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who </line>
         <line>' never have seen or heard of perfection in these </line>
         <line>' matters, will naturally be slovens.' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>He afterwards remarks – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect </line>
         <line>' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without </line>
         <line>' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven </line>
         <line>' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, </line>
         <line>' who came from this very spot, think the people </line>
         <line>' <i>dirty</i> in the western country. I'll engage he </line>
         <line>' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one </line>
         <line>' family of his present neighbours, than he left </line>
         <line>' behind upon the skins of all the people in </line>
         <line>' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he </line>
         <line>' would not have found this to be the case in </line>
         <line>' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where </line>
         <line>' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in </line>
         <line>' the New England States, the people are as </line>
         <line>' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. </line>
         <line>' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the </line>
         <line>' nastiest thing in nature.' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells </line>
         <line>us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we </line>
         <line>admit, was formerly, and may still continue in </line>
         <line>some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. </line>
         <line>But does this reasonable person mean to argue </line>
         <line>from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and </line>
         <line>ought not to be corrected. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a </line>
         <line>settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on </line>
         <line>this subject by the authority of various writers, </line>
         <line>and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's </line>
         <line>Guide, a work of great merit, which combines </line>
         <line>an extent and precision of statistical informa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion altogether unequally, with the most enlar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ged general views of the state of the country, </line>
         <line>both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes </line>
         <line>' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United </line>
         <line>' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only </line>
         <line>' essential advantages offered are the security of </line>
         <line>' person and property, and the cheapness of land. </line>
         <line>' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, </line>
         <line>' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to </line>
         <line>' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' mands the permanency of this continued la<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Our anonymous correspondent is also ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tremely displeased that we have stated so strong<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly the perincious effects produced on the gene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ral manners of the Americans by the existence </line>
         <line>of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labour<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>er in this country might envy the condition of an </line>
         <line>American slave. What are those privileges for </line>
         <line>which a free man should envy a slave he does </line>
         <line>not think proper to state. To show, however, </line>
         <line>that we have not exaggerated the degradation </line>
         <line>and oppression of the coloured class in the Unit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed States, we shall again adduce the authority of </line>
         <line>the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradict<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the notion that the labourer in the slave </line>
         <line>States is confounded with the negroe ; and he </line>
         <line>expresses himself in the following terms: – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a </line>
         <line>' general expression, that, in such places, whites, </line>
         <line>' performing manual labour, are confounded in </line>
         <line>' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. </line>
         <line>' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful </line>
         <line>' labour in the slave states than where all the </line>
         <line>' duties are performed by whites, yet </line>
         <line>' the distance between the two races of men are </line>
         <line>' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and </line>
         <line>' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that </line>
         <line>' not any where in the United States can pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other </line>
         <line>' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' nion a man the most remotely allied to the </line>
         <line>' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. </line>
         <line>' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' ana will be witness to some very remarkable </line>
         <line>' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all </line>
         <line>' those who affinity involve them in the con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>What a picture is here conveyed of misery </line>
         <line>and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny </line>
         <line>on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed </line>
         <line>that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel<sh/>
         </line>
         <column/>
         <line>lectual, not even the possession of property, can </line>
         <line>give a man the least degree of consideration in </line>
         <line>the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot </line>
         <line>conceive a community more wretchedly consti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tuted. All that is estimable and worthy is here </line>
         <line>utterly contemned, because the individual who </line>
         <line>possesses these qualities happens to have his skin </line>
         <line>of a particular colour, and thus a merely acci<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dental quality of the corporeal frame entails </line>
         <line>upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy </line>
         <line>and contempt. These distinctions, carried to </line>
         <line>such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the </line>
         <line>extinction of every generous and honourable sen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>timent, and we cannot help still asserting that </line>
         <line>we had rather live we at present are, than </line>
         <line>in a community where such hateful antipathies </line>
         <line>rule to the exclusion of every just and humane </line>
         <line>feeling. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>With regard to the condition of the negroe </line>
         <line>slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's </line>
         <line>Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory </line>
         <line>after reading which, we shall leave our anony<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mous correspondent to say whether he thinks </line>
         <line>the condition of a labourer in this country pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ferable to that of being an African slave. The </line>
         <line>writer, describing the town of Lexington, in </line>
         <line>Kentucky, observes – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>' In this square stands the market-house, </line>
         <line>' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the </line>
         <line>' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here </line>
         <line>' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are </line>
         <line>' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment </line>
         <line>' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their </line>
         <line>' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I </line>
         <line>' could not help saying to myself, " These cries </line>
         <line>' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Having made this answer to the angry charges </line>
         <line>thus brought against us, we have only to dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>claim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>judice against the Americans. We have no </line>
         <line>wish either to depreciate their character or in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stitutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle </line>
         <line>of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace </line>
         <line>to wealth and greatness. To revile such a </line>
         <line>people would be the height of human folly, and </line>
         <line>equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to </line>
         <line>take offence because endeavour to make a </line>
         <line>fair estimate of their character, without hiding </line>
         <line>any of its defects. </line>

      <p>
         <line>On Friday, the 30th of October, the Court of Oyer </line>
         <line>and Terminer proceeded to try the gentlemen accused </line>
         <line>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. </line>
         <line>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 </line>

         <line>and <i>after</i> the fact. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pany had been upwards of thirty years in possession </line>
         <line>of trading posts called <i>forts</i> at different points on the </line>
         <line>Red River in the Indian Territories, and it is well </line>
         <line>known that for a century before the North West Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stant practise of resorting to that country which was </line>
         <line>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's </line>
         <line>Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was </line>
         <line>put in evidence that for many years afterwards both </line>
         <line>companies carried on their trade to Red River without </line>
         <line>interference in each others pursuits, and without any </line>
         <line>disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that </line>
         <line>the principal object of the trade being to collect pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>falo, which abound in the plains) and the country pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the </line>
         <line>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading </line>
         <line>stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tities, and where rival traders would at all times be </line>
         <line>likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red </line>
         <line>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists </line>
         <line>and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders </line>
         <line>to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being </line>
         <line>obtained by the traders. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ant <i>Governor of Ossinibour</i>, prohibiting the exporta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It </line>
         <line>was proved that, under this assumed authority, several </line>
         <line>acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and </line>
         <line>his followers. Trading posts and buildings were for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the </line>
         <line>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries </line>
         <line>mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North </line>
         <line>West Company wholly interdicted, before any acts of </line>
         <line>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore they took any precautions for their own defence </line>
         <line>or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which </line>
         <line>depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of </line>
         <line>their people. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>aliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both </line>
         <line>parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the </line>
         <line>designs of each other as to be always on their guard </line>
         <line>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in </line>
         <line>evidence that the country remained in a state of pri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vate war, which at length ended in the <i>battle</i> of the </line>
         <line>loch of Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfort<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>unate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche </line>
         <line>and Brown for murder, as <i>principals</i>. The state<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments on both sides are already before the public, and </line>
         <line>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the </line>
         <line>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been </line>
         <line>the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories </line>
         <line>the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tile parties were made out in the evidence to the following </line>
         <line>effect, viz : – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In <i>March</i>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an </line>
         <line>armed party, acting under the orders of <i>Governor</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>Semple</i>, who had succeeded <i>Governor</i> Miles Macdonnell </line>
         <line>at Red River, captured by surprise the North West </line>
         <line>trading post at the forks of the river, called <i>Fort</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>Gibraltar</i>, and took possession of all the stores and </line>
         <line>provisions. In the latter part of the following month </line>
         <line>of May, Governor Semple caused the buildings (which </line>
         <line>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials </line>
         <line>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>structing his new fort, which he called <i>Fort Douglas</i>
         </line>
         <line>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) </line>
         <line>he mounted cannon to command the passage of the </line>
         <line>river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. </line>
         <line>Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West </line>
         <line>Company, who had charge of their provisions at Ri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, </line>
         <line>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and </line>
         <line>others) for the protection of the property under his care, </line>
         <line>with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the </line>
         <line>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor </line>
         <line>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made </line>
         <line>dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a </line>
         <line>party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet </line>
         <line>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, </line>
         <line>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>moving it. This party, under the direction of Cuth<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West </line>
         <line>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas </line>
         <line>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and </line>
         <line>to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance </line>
         <line>as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– </line>
         <line>This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the </line>
         <line>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about </line>
         <line>two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from </line>
         <line>then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple, and </line>
         <line>most of his party, were killed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It was further made out in evidence that in the </line>
         <line>Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West </line>
         <line>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than </line>
         <line>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cause there had not yet been time to replace the ves<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sels on the lakes, and the other means of transport </line>
         <line>which the Americans had destroyed during the war, </line>
         <line>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the </line>
         <line>usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having </line>
         <line>also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red </line>
         <line>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending </line>
         <line>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of </line>
         <line>the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could </line>
         <line>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country </line>
         <line>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, </line>
         <line>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar </line>
         <line>and the blockade of Red River, towards which place </line>
         <line>he immediately proceeded with as many of the part<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could </line>
         <line>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted </line>
         <line>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own </line>
         <line>defence, if fired on by Semple's blockading battery, it </line>
         <line>was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but </line>
         <line>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders </line>
         <line>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas </line>
         <line>singing, and to proceed up the river for their provi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sions, without landing or molesting any one unless </line>
         <line>they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River </line>
         <line>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was </line>
         <line>a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party </line>
         <line>had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had </line>
         <line>only acted in self defence, did not adopt any measures </line>
         <line>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, </line>
         <line>expressed approbation for their having defended their </line>
         <line>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. </line>
         <line>usually given to all the servants of the North West </line>
         <line>Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some </line>
         <line>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions </line>
         <line>in the Courts of Lower Canada. </line>
         <column/>
         <line>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only </line>
         <line>circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, </line>
         <line>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before </line>
         <line>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he </line>
         <line>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions </line>
         <line>past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries </line>
         <line>after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, </line>
         <line>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, </line>
         <line>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the </line>
         <line>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the </line>
         <line>successful party <i>were not murderers</i>–The Judge who </line>
         <line>presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury </line>
         <line>that there was not a <i>scintilla</i> of evidence " against any </line>
         <line>one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turned a verdict of <i>Not Guilty</i>. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug </line>
         <line>1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>racy, as well as Murder–and that the buildings and </line>
         <line>property of the North West Company at that place </line>
         <line>were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an </line>
         <line>armed force under his Lordship's command. The </line>
         <line>North West Company represented at the time that these </line>
         <line>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the </line>
         <line>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction </line>
         <line>of their trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it </line>
         <line>was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners </line>
         <line>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to </line>
         <line>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and </line>
         <line>for some time the public opinion remained in suspense </line>
         <line>as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded </line>
         <line>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, </line>
         <line>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of </line>
         <line>which the North West Company recovered possession </line>
         <line>of their property, and re-established their trade ; but </line>
         <line>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the </line>
         <line>crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated </line>
         <line>and decided upon by the law – and until such investi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gation could take place, much uncertainty necessarily </line>
         <line>prevailed from the contradictory statements and affida<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vits which had been laid before the public. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The recent trials at York however decided the </line>
         <line>point as to the alleged <i>murders</i>, and the charge of </line>
         <line>
            <i>High Treason</i> has never been followed up, nor ever </line>
         <line>mentioned, since it served the desired purpose, by </line>
         <line>figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for </line>
         <line>seizing and examining the books and private papers of </line>
         <line>of the North West Company. </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It has been already mentioned that Governor </line>
         <line>Maitland, on opening the session of the Legis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lature of Upper Canada, recommended that mea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sures should be taken to prevent the meeting </line>
         <line>of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Cana<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>da. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, da<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ted the end of November, state, that in pursu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ance of this recommendation, the Legislature, </line>
         <line>on one of the first days of its meeting, appoint<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who </line>
         <line>almost instantly came to the following resolu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion :ߝ </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that </line>
         <line>some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vide to meet similar occasions, to put it out of the power of </line>
         <line>any designing persons to organize discontent. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The proceeding appears to have raised the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dignation of the Gourlay or reofrming party in </line>
         <line>Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following </line>
         <line>extract :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Montreal, November 21. </line>
         <line>This legislative provision, it will be immediate<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas </line>
         <line>Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in </line>
         <line>England. We do not believe that there is the </line>
         <line>most remote necessity for such a measure. We </line>
         <line>do not hesitate to say, that the members have </line>
         <line>not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, </line>
         <line>in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with </line>
         <line>the most humiliating servility ; and we feel con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vinced that it will not be borne with by the </line>
         <line>people, while they have the control in any way </line>
         <line>of their representatives. The sentiment therein </line>
         <line>attempted to be disseminated is an </line>

         <column/>
         <line>libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. </line>
         <line>It would sound in our ears like the knell of their </line>
         <line>liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its adop<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion would provoke a spirit of resistance, not </line>
         <line>corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but </line>
         <line>open and legitimate, which (if the Administra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion do not take the decision of the question </line>
         <line>from the people by force, and we believe they </line>
         <line>cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the con<sh/>

         <line>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, </line>

         <line>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them </line>
         <line>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going </line>
         <line>into the interior, and the returns from coming into </line>
         <line>Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and </line>
         <line>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal </line>
         <line>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, </line>
         <line>and without having ever followed up the charge ; the </line>
         <line>pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North </line>
         <line>West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of </line>
         <line>continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith </line>
         <line>against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<sh/>

         <line> sheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bear<sh/>

         <line>er of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a </line>
         <line>special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and grant<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort </line>
         <line>William to the North West Company. He was also </line>
         <line>the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his </line>
         <line>Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, u<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pon an information upon oath before a justice of the </line>
         <line>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of </line>
         <line>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, </line>
         <line>with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when </line>
         <line>the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon </line>
         <line>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him </line>
         <line>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards </line>
         <line>kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. </line>
         <line>A circumstance which added much to the grievous na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ture of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt </line>
         <line>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that </line>

         </line>
         <line>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which </line>
         <line>it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and </line>
         <line>breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest </line>
         <line>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding </line>
         <line>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not </line>
         <line>liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his </line>
         <line>Lordship and his forces in May, 1818. </line>

            <i>April</i> 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here </line>
         <line>to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most </line>
         <line>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other </line>
         <line>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages </line>
         <line>and it is computed that at one time there were full three </line>
         <line>thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gate. As many of them marched into the town with great </line>
         <line>sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their </line>
         <line>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not </line>
         <line>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and </line>
         <line>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, </line>
         <line>there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. </line>
         <line>By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, </line>

         <line>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath </line>
         <line>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do </line>
         <line>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active </line>
         <line>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor </line>
         <line>men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have ex<sh/>

         <line>can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these </line>

         <line>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there </line>
         <line>are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of </line>
         <line>the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, </line>
         <line>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are </line>

         <line>from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, </line>
         <line>Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these </line>
         <line>extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise </line>
         <line>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every </line>
         <line>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more </line>
         <line>consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and in<sh/>

         <line>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, </line>
         <line>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<sh/>

         <line>take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<sh/>

         </line>
         <line>peared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and </line>
         <line>apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry </line>
         <line>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, </line>
         <line>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the </line>

            <i>Bank Committee.</i>–The Opposition Journals, last wek, as<sh/>

         <line>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of </line>
         <line>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of </line>
         <line>paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January </line>
         <line>in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, </line>
         <line>any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred </line>
         <line>pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall </line>
         <line>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. </line>
         <line>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars </line>
         <line>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall </line>
         <line>at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, </line>
         <line>when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the </line>
         <line>Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments </line>
         <line>in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt </line>
         <line>that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All </line>
         <line>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in fo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold </line>
         <line>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run </line>
         <line>on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, </line>
         <line>will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, </line>
         <line>the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on </line>
         <line>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, </line>
         <line>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the </line>
         <line>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in </line>
         <line>perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>order it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase </line>
         <line>gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the </line>
         <line>amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold </line>
         <line>was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we </line>
         <line>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 </line>
         <line>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have </line>
         <line>an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn </line>
         <line>become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank </line>
         <line>will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr </line>
         <line>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unques<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of </line>
         <line>the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, </line>
         <line>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. </line>
         <line>The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her </line>
         <line>troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to </line>
         <line>fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the </line>
         <line>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to li<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. </line>
         <line>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; </line>
         <line>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] </line>
         <line>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in </line>
         <line>voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be </line>
         <line>in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion </line>
         <line>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against </line>
         <line>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational </line>
         <line>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposi<sh/>

         <line>Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack </line>

         <line>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remain<sh/>

         <line>ing two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost </line>
         <line>one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, </line>

         <line>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. </line>
         <line>He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<sh/>

         </line>

            its first </line>

         <line>days, 45 of that number were numbered with the dead. </line>
         <line>The contagion was so rapid, that it soon spread into </line>
         <line>the town, shipping, and country, and proved equally </line>
         <line>fatal. The disorder was such, it baffled all medical </line>
         <line>aid. The alarming symptoms were such, that business </line>
         <line>was nearly suspended–the white population seeking </line>
         <line>safety in other islands, or in the remote and healthiest </line>
         <line>part of this. I assure you, that every thing had a </line>
         <line>most gloomy appearance ; and the disease was so con<sh/>

         <line>of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in </line>

         </line>
         <line>we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a </line>

               province="Louisiana" country="United States">New Orleans</mention> ; </line>
         <line>we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. </line>
         <line>I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, </line>
         <line>corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake </line>
         <line>went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night co<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and my<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>self the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten </line>
         <line>o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, </line>
         <line>and did not return to us till the next morning. It being </line>
         <line>wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite </line>
         <line>of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, </line>
         <line>and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, </line>

         <line>than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms </line>
         <line>with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required </line>
         <line>here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New </line>
         <line>Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon </line>
         <line>are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, &amp; c. ; he made </line>
         <line>250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers </line>
         <line>five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, </line>
         <line>as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French </line>
         <line>settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are </line>
         <line>the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. – </line>

            The </line>

         <line>of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like </line>
         <line>the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and </line>
         <line>Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as </line>
         <line>those of Bath. <mention keyword="religion">Here is one Church</mention>, which is a
            very </line>
         <line>beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nish shops are all open, and it is a market during the </line>
         <line>whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, </line>
         <line>gambling &amp; c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the </line>
         <line>best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good </line>
         <line>living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including </line>
         <line>claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm </line>
         <line>weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it </line>
         <line>was in England in July, although not half so oppressive </line>
         <line>and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the elec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of </line>
         <line>them English. We do not trouble ourselves about poli<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, </line>
         <line>and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday </line>
         <line>we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four </line>
         <line>dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three </line>
         <line>and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four </line>
         <line>quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more </line>
         <line>of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and </line>
         <line>Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. </line>
         <line>Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres </line>
         <line>of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of </line>
         <line>hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as </line>
         <line>well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to </line>
         <line>marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells </line>
         <line>me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over </line>
         <line>the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they </line>
         <line>are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought </line>
         <line>over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I under<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can </line>
         <line>live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer </line>
         <line>of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I </line>
         <line>have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can </line>
         <line>get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is </line>
         <line>a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny </line>
         <line>per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to </line>
         <line>pay. <mention keyword="wages">Price of labour</mention> is very dear here ; we pay a
            dollar </line>
         <line>for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handker<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one </line>
         <line>and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things </line>
         <line>shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>though I should like England very well if it was not for </line>
         <line>the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like </line>

         <line>spectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The best time for coming to America I </line>
         <line>should judge to be in the summer, to land in </line>
         <line>September, so as to be able to get here before </line>
         <line>the weather was too cold. It is safe to </line>
         <line>settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as </line>
         <line>to inure to the climate by degrees. The best </line>
         <line>plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage </line>
         <line>of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you </line>
         <line>will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, </line>
         <line>than would buy a decent farm here. The lands </line>
         <line>in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and </line>
         <line>one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is </line>
         <line>never applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is </line>
         <line>without question what the land here is as good as </line>
         <line>can be, and when to this is added the heat of </line>
         <line>the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops </line>
         <line>as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 </line>
         <line>dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not </line>
         <line>cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut </line>
         <line>down and burned on the ground, and the large </line>
         <line>ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The </line>
         <line>ground is then prepared for Indian corn by </line>
         <line>scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, </line>
         <line>which, from the looseness and mellowness of the </line>
         <line>soil, is easily done, and in this way sixty or </line>
         <line>eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – </line>
         <line>the trees die in a few months, and in three or </line>
         <line>four years fall down one by one, and the roots </line>
         <line>will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a </line>
         <line>great want of sense in any new settler not to </line>
         <line>adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the </line>
         <line>best adapted to the state of it by 200 years ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perience. The Americans, of all other people I </line>
         <line>know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the </line>
         <line>means to the end. I do not know if they have </line>
         <line>more sense than other nations, but they certain<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly make it go farther. Every tools answers the </line>
         <line>purpose most effectually. This is evident in their </line>
         <line>axes. An American will cut down three times </line>
         <line>more trees and square three times more timber </line>
         <line>than the best of your wrights could do, and not </line>
         <line>by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is </line>
         <line>with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down </line>
         <line>four acres of wheat in a day, what what he calls </line>
         <line>a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for bind<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian </line>
         <line>corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels </line>
         <line>of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is </line>
         <line>easier farming here than with you on sundry ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>counts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their</line>
         <line>appearance, and when ploughed down are cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts </line>
         <line>to injure the crop, and no wet weather to de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, </line>
         <line>and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed </line>
         <line>the next. From the shortness and mildness of </line>
         <line>the winter, little provender is needed for the </line>
         <line>stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They </line>
         <line>breed and feed in the woods, and only want from </line>
         <line>one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, </line>
         <line>when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less </line>
         <line>settled parts of the country, it is the practise to </line>
         <line>give all the corn to swine and then send them to </line>
         <line>market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment </line>
         <line>to a bushel of wheat for man or beast. </line>

         <line>Advices have been received again from the Cape of </line>

         <line>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the </line>
         <line>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does </line>
         <line>not appear that Government have as yet received of<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficial information regarding it. The private accounts </line>
         <line>state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and </line>
         <line>also a great number of men. The Governor himself </line>
         <line>in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<sh/>

         <line>fres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the </line>
         <line>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this </line>
         <line>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days </line>
         <line>tranquility would have been restored. </line>

         <line>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<sh/>

         <line>25th January, and has done great mischief to the ship<sh/>

         <line>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the </line>
         <line>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<sh/>

         <line>and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered </line>
         <line>to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in </line>

         <line>forts to procure the ordinary means of suste<sh/>

         <line>dividuals, who, being unable to command capi<sh/>

         <line>tal enough singly, to encounter the expences of </line>
         <line>a new settlement, have put their little funds to<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gether, with a determination to sail for America, </line>

         <line>their efforts as to enable them to become inde<sh/>

         <line>"<small_caps>Sir</small_caps> – Your favour of 15th June is before me. </line>
         <line>Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I </line>
         <line>proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting </line>
         <line>domestic servants ; what may be the condition of </line>
         <line>our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, </line>
         <line>but should it be in your power to bring with you </line>
         <line>female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also </line>
         <line>a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with </line>
         <line>families, so much the better. Written engage<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments for a term, or indentures, are not binding, </line>
         <line>unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I </line>
         <line>have not seen any of these documents, and can </line>
         <line>therefore give you no precise directions for them : </line>
         <line>perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, </line>
         <line>acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred </line>
         <line>in bringing our, might be a sufficient security, </line>
         <line>leaving their wages to be determined here ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cording to the current rates, yet to be establish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed by the proportion of supply to the demand, </line>
         <line>which, as I remarked above, it is now impossible </line>
         <line>to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or </line>
         <line>female domestics, you would need perhaps six of </line>
         <line>the former and two of the latter would a safe </line>
         <line>adventure, looking to the colony for an ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dition, should you need it, after you are set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tled – before that you will find a greater num<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I </line>
         <line>can say to your first, third, fourth, and fifth </line>
         <line>queries. All expence of transfer of your fami<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh </line>
         <line>ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under </line>
         <line>L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower </line>
         <line>would give you most particular information – </line>
         <line>The luggage would cost about ten dollars per </line>
         <line>100 lbs. So much for your query. To the se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>venth query – I think L.200 would assist your </line>
         <line>family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages </line>
         <line>and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be </line>
         <line>a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I </line>
         <line>question your wishing to hold in cultivation a </line>
         <line>larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our si<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tuation not liable to future disturbance from In<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dians, in the event of a war between Great Bri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain and the United States, being covered by in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>creasing settlements to the west, north-west, and </line>
         <line>north. Tenth query – The earthquakes men<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many </line>
         <line>persons ; but I have not discovered that it has </line>
         <line>left any impression on the public mind ; on this </line>
         <line>score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about </line>
         <line>the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in propor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earth<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Or<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>leans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that </line>
         <line>by the eastern cities. When due precaution </line>
         <line>against the diseases of the climate are observed, </line>
         <line>I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth </line>
         <line>query – The health of my family has not suffered </line>
         <line>from the climate. One of my sons has been </line>
         <line>affected with ague. This summer has been </line>
         <line>more sickly in these parts than any season for </line>
         <line>seven years past, and has afforded me a most en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>couraging confirmation of the temperature and </line>
         <line>salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded </line>
         <line>immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the </line>
         <line>sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so </line>
         <line>anxiously invited the attention of the readers of </line>
         <line>my journal. On the whole, provided common </line>
         <line>sense should be seconded by common industry, </line>
         <line>in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I </line>
         <line>think we shall not be visisted by more than our </line>
         <line>due share of physical calamity. I deferred no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ticing your second query, the subect being con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nected with the proposal respecting land, at the </line>
         <line>conclusion of your letter. I would strongly re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>commend your deferring the purchase of land </line>
         <line>until your arrival. It would be difficult to con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vey to you the reasons, but you would feel the </line>
         <line>propriety of my advice, should you come. I </line>
         <line>think you would have as good a choice two </line>
         <line>years hence as now, because excellent siutations, </line>
         <line>as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have </line>
         <line>no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. </line>
         <line>You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they </line>
         <line>are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, </line>
         <line>in new countries, often abound to an astonishing </line>
         <line>degree, and are sufficiently teazing to man and </line>
         <line>beast. Many species yield instantly to cultiva<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, and are heard of no more as plagues ; </line>
         <line>others will continue until conquered by order </line>
         <line>and industry. The thermometer ranges from </line>
         <line>13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of </line>
         <line>course, of rare occurence, and short duration. </line>
         <line>At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this sum<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low </line>
         <line>river bottoms, I believe it might reach that de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gree. On our praire I think it never reached </line>
         <line>89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon </line>
         <line>dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – cat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others </line>
         <line>I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a </line>
         <line>comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient ser<sh/>

         <line>I have to acquaint you in reply to your letter of the </line>
         <line>–, that the following are the conditions under which </line>
         <line>it is proposed to give encouragement to emigration to the </line>

         <line>even the means of support, having been very afflicting to </line>
         <line>themselves, and equally burdensome to the colonies to </line>
         <line>which they have proceeded, the Government have deter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mined to confine the application of the money recently </line>
         <line>voted by address in the House of Commons, to those per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons, who possessing the means, will engage to carry out, at </line>
         <line>the least, ten able bodied individuals above 18 years of age, </line>
         <line>with or without families, the Government always reserving </line>

         <line>to them those which may prove, upon examination, to be </line>
         <line>most eligible. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In order to give some security to the Government, that </line>
         <line>the persons undertaking to make these establishments </line>
         <line>have the means of doing so, every person engaging to take </line>
         <line>out the above mentioned number of persons or families </line>
         <line>shall deposit at the rate of L.10 (to be repaid as herein<sh/>

         <line>that the family does not consist of more than one man, </line>
         <line>one woman, and two children under 14 years of age. All </line>
         <line>children above the number of two will have to be paid for, </line>
         <line>in addition to the deposit above mentioned, in the propor<sh/>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In consideration of this deposit, a passage shall be pro<sh/>

         <line>tion of the person taking them out are actually located </line>
         <line>upon the land assigned to them ; and the remainer at </line>

         <line>tion, not less in number and of the description above<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> mentioned, and shall advance money in the proportion </line>
         <line>above-mentioned, the Government will grant land to such </line>
         <line>an individual at the rate of 100 acres for every head of a fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mily, leaving the parish at liverty to make such conditions </line>
         <line>with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated </line>
         <line>to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the </line>
         <line>maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return </line>
         <line>to this country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>But no offers of this kind will be accepted, unless it </line>
         <line>shall be clear that the persons proposin to become settlers </line>
         <line>shall have distinctly given their consent, and the head of </line>
         <line>each family is not infirm or incapable of work. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one </line>
         <line>hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to </line>
         <line>carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, </line>
         <line>Government will, upon their being actually located, as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sign a salary to the minister who they have may have </line>
         <line>selected to accompany them, if he shall be approved by </line>
         <line>the Secretary of State. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The lands will be granted at a quit rent to be fixed, </line>
         <line>which rent, however, will be remitted for the first ten </line>
         <line>years ; and at the expiration of three years (during which </line>
         <line>the party and a number of families, in the proportion of </line>
         <line>one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), </line>
         <line>the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, </line>
         <line>and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, </line>
         <line>on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 </line>
         <line>sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this </line>
         <line>clause beyond the usual reservations"–that the land shall </line>
         <line>become foreited to Government, in case the party shall </line>
         <line>abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within </line>
         <line>a given number of years. I am </line>
         <line>Your most obedient humble servant. </line>
         <line>* The usual reservations are the right of the Crown to mines </line>
         <line>of precious stones, of gold and silver, and to make such roads </line>
         <line>as may be necessary for the convenience of the colony. </line>

         <line>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that </line>
         <line>the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Mait<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to </line>

         <line>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<sh/>

         <line>putation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon </line>

         <line>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<sh/>

         <line>banded. It is stated that each of the men will have a </line>
         <line>certain portion of land allotted them in that province </line>
         <line>for cultivation and their future support. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d </line>
         <line>ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on </line>
         <line>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Do<sh/>

         <line>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of </line>
         <line>the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated </line>
         <line>reformer: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, </line>
         <line>we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr </line>
         <line>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to </line>
         <line>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duction is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, </line>
         <line>abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place </line>
         <line>of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the super<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in </line>
         <line>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well </line>
         <line>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sent from the political proceeding of this reformer, it </line>
         <line>would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to </line>
         <line>enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of </line>
         <line>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others </line>
         <line>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. </line>
         <line>Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men </line>
         <line>we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has </line>
         <line>deprived society of the benefits which might have been </line>
         <line>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless </line>
         <line>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy </line>
         <line>that his career has been checked without any bad con<sh/>

         <line>We are sorry to state that another most distressing </line>
         <line>and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's New<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] </line>
         <line>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] </line>
         <line>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke </line>
         <line>out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one </line>
         <line>and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June </line>
         <line>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] </line>
         <line>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such </line>
         <line>rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] </line>
         <line>milies were burnt out, besides an immense quantity </line>

         <line>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<sh/>

         <line>ed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out </line>

         <line>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of </line>
         <line>peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] </line>

         <line>Cape Town, May 5. </line>
         <line>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war </line>
         <line>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said </line>
         <line>that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Satur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried </line>
         <line>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every </line>
         <line>district of the colony for the young boors to inrol them<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>selves to oppose the enemy. </line>

         <line>Cape Town, May 16. </line>
         <line>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>shire have come up with the main body of Caf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with </line>
         <line>great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the </line>
         <line>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] </line>
         <line>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] </line>
         <line>marched off for the frontiers. A large number of in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] </line>
         <line>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are </line>
         <line>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present </line>
         <line>Governor is going home, and that another has been ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pointed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, </line>
         <line>which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of </line>
         <line>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears </line>
         <line>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from </line>
         <line>San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight </line>
         <line>from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. </line>
         <line>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and left </line>
         <line>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had </line>
         <line>been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] </line>
         <line>Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive rein<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forcements from England, when he would retake it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Blossom arrived on Sunday from the South A<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>merican station, last from Rio Janeiro, whence she </line>
         <line>sailed on the 8th of June. She landed about two mil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and brought </line>
         <line>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, </line>
         <line>and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] </line>
         <line>treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, </line>
         <line>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover </line>
         <line>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the </line>
         <line>ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent </line>
         <line>order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state, </line>
         <line>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper </line>
         <line>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every </line>
         <line>instance of complaint made to him by the mas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ters of merchant shipping, of any of their crew having </line>
         <line>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again in<sh/>

         <line>stantly sent on board their respective ships. </line>

            <small_caps>Hope</small_caps>. </line>
         <line>(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to </line>
         <line>Parliament the expediency of voting &#x163;50,000 towards </line>
         <line>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good </line>
         <line>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is </line>
         <line>not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but </line>
         <line>that the mother country is too full, that this plan is sug<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gested. The question is not how you maintain </line>
         <line>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, </line>
         <line>but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen </line>
         <line>shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert </line>
         <line>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – </line>
         <line>We surely have learnt enough of North America to </line>
         <line>convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of </line>
         <line>its people. South African, on the other hand, has every </line>
         <line>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of </line>
         <line>our forefathers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The more fully to understand and appreciate these </line>
         <line>advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view </line>
         <line>of the conditions and facilities of the colony in ques<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The spring, from September to December, is the </line>
         <line>most agreedable season. The summer, from December </line>
         <line>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from </line>
         <line>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The </line>
         <line>winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so </line>
         <line>cold as to make fires very comfortable during the </line>
         <line>months of July, August, and September. Most of the </line>
         <line>diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather </line>
         <line>from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the </line>
         <line>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in </line>
         <line>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want </line>
         <line>of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as </line>
         <line>it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from </line>
         <line>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. </line>
         <line>Good and abundant water has always been found by </line>
         <line>digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the </line>
         <line>whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called </line>
         <line>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the </line>
         <line>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All </line>
         <line>the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small </line>
         <line>turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast </line>
         <line>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There is general want of wood in South Africa – </line>
         <line>At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay </line>
         <line>there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some </line>
         <line>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing </line>
         <line>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or </line>
         <line>40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure to </line>
         <line>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet </line>
         <line>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – </line>
         <line>The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree... </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, </line>
         <line>and to what perfection the other wines of the colony </line>
         <line>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be au<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch </line>
         <line>farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tity than the quality of their wine. And when a car<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>go was once shipped, it mattered little to them, whe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ther sound or sour it reached its destination. Little </line>
         <line>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches </line>
         <line>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>miscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode </line>
         <line>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the </line>
         <line>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have </line>
         <line>all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine </line>
         <line>the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately </line>
         <line>been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons </line>
         <line>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and </line>
         <line>every care seems now taken to meet and secure the </line>
         <line>growing demand in European markets. The trifling </line>
         <line>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has been </line>
         <line>the means of introducing it into many families, which </line>
         <line>have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the </line>
         <line>merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances </line>
         <line>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>couragement should be given to the stape export of a </line>
         <line>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles </line>
         <line>of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rope, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, </line>
         <column/>
         <line>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap </line>
         <line>and candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of </line>
         <line>commerce that might be turned to the best account. – </line>
         <line>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode </line>
         <line>of administering its government and laws. It has been </line>
         <line>said, that despotism would be the best of governments </line>
         <line>were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but conti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the purest a<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mongst us needs some control. Control, however, </line>
         <line>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes </line>
         <line>and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment <i>his</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>fiat</i> becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an </line>
         <line>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does </line>
         <line>not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to </line>
         <line>add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch </line>
         <line>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the </line>
         <line>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are </line>
         <line>in writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, <i>foribus</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>clausis</i>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and </line>
         <line>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in </line>
         <line>Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act </line>
         <line>as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is </line>
         <line>no appeal beyond the governor. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we </line>
         <line>groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively </line>
         <line>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy </line>
         <line>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.– </line>
         <line>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it </line>
         <line>fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions of the Parliamentary grant. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and </line>
         <line>precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr </line>
         <line>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be </line>
         <line>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each </line>
         <line>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on </line>
         <line>reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the </line>
         <line>settler by the local government. And such is the li<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is more<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to </line>
         <line>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only </line>
         <line>permission will be granted them so to do, but provi<sh/>

         <line>try and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay </line>
         <line>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that </line>
         <line>in distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the </line>
         <line>settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a </line>
         <line>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have </line>
         <line>all united to attach him. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lish, has already been made upon a limited plan at </line>
         <line>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : </line>
         <line>and with such success as to give the best encourage<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from </line>
         <line>what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great </line>
         <line>facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits </line>
         <line>that must arise to the sober, steady exertions of the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and </line>
         <line>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but </line>
         <line>certain we are, that there is no country under heaven, </line>
         <line>where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so </line>
         <line>certain and full a reward. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a </line>
         <line>Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates </line>
         <line>were known to save the whole of their pay, and were </line>
         <line>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand </line>
         <line>some little fortune. English servants of all descrip<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are </line>
         <line>no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is never<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>theless to beremember, that clothes of all kinds are </line>
         <line>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, </line>
         <line>lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still </line>
         <line>farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; </line>
         <line>and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are </line>
         <line>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a </line>
         <line>climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions </line>
         <line>require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is </line>
         <line>a hard mattress with a single coverlet. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as </line>
         <line>we think it very intimately connected with the virtue </line>
         <line>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the educa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than </line>
         <line>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are </line>
         <line>ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be </line>
         <line>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as </line>
         <line>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, and a free school upon that plan has been esta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blished at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still </line>
         <line>the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their </line>
         <line>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all </line>
         <line>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they </line>
         <line>have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has </line>
         <line>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and </line>
         <line>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants </line>
         <line>by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want </line>
         <line>of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits </line>
         <line>shown by the Dutch laws to the <i>white</i> man's barbari<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ties have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – </line>
         <line>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, there<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the </line>
         <line>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, </line>
         <line>and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with </line>
         <line>our duty to God and man will counteract this influence </line>
         <line>aided a knowledge of common school attainments, </line>
         <line>we need not say. The </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We have thrown these remarks together more as </line>
         <line>loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than </line>
         <line>with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide </line>
         <line>and important a subject. We may be induced here<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>after to review the question more in detail. The plan </line>
         <line>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, </line>
         <line>has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rice we have not seen, and can only speak from the </line>
         <line>reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and </line>
         <line>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food </line>
         <line>is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceed<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ingly high, trade is important and increasing, many </line>
         <line>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is </line>
         <line>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth </line>
         <line>where so many components of happiness will be found </line>
         <line>to concentrate. </line>

      <p>
         <line>Sir – I am directed by Earl Batburst to acquaint you, that </line>
         <line>he has under consideration your letter of, and </line>
         <line>that he accepts the proposal which you have mde, to take a </line>

         <line>of Good Hope, where a grant of land will accordingly be as<sh/>

         <line>have placed themselves under your direction, and I inclose to </line>
         <line>you proper returns for that purpose ; at the same time, I deem </line>
         <line>it necessary to mention, that it is absolutely requisite that the </line>
         <line>details respecting the individuals of your party which you are </line>
         <line>called upon to state in your returns should be correctly speci<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fied, as any erroneous statement upon these heads, but more </line>
         <line>particularly in respect of the age of the individuals, could not </line>
         <line>fail to be productive of much inconvenience. Upon receiving </line>
         <line>there returns, I shall lose no time in stating to you the amount </line>
         <line>of the money which you will be required to deposit under </line>
         <line>the existing regulations, and the mode in which the payment </line>
         <line>is to be made. </line>

         <line>should transmit to me a (fourth) list, specifying their usual </line>
         <line>place of residence, and the designation under which they are </line>
         <line>respectively known at the War Office, and at the Admiralty, </line>
         <line>in order that I may take the necessary measures to enable </line>
         <line>them to receive their allowances in the colony. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>These persons should, on their part, immediately apply to </line>
         <line>the Secretary at War, and to the Secretary of the Admiralty, </line>
         <line>stating their intention to emigrate to the Cape of Good Hope, </line>
         <line>and requesting instructions for their guidance in respect to the </line>
         <line>receipt of their allowances. </line>

            <i>Cape Town Gazettes</i> to the 1st of August have come </line>
         <line>to our hands. At the present moment, when plans for </line>
         <line>colonising the territory adjoining the Cape of Good </line>
         <line>Hope, occupy so much attention, we turn to these pa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pers with peculiar anxiety. They, however, contain </line>
         <line>little notice of public events at the Cape ; and nothing </line>
         <line>whatever is said of the incursions of the Caffres. We </line>
         <line>collect incidentally, that the scarcity which lately pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vailed at the Cape has entirely ceased ; ample supplies </line>
         <line>of wheat and flour having lately been imported or </line>

         <line>Friday, a Court Martial was assembled on board the </line>
         <line>Queen Charlotte, in Portsmouth harbour, and con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinued by adjournment during Saturday, to inquire into </line>
         <line>the circumstances of the supposed concealment of two </line>
         <line>deserters from the band of the 18th regiment of foot </line>
         <line>on board his Majesty's ships Phaeton[?], Captain W. H. </line>
         <line>Dillon, in the month of October last, when that ship </line>
         <line>was about to proceed to the East Indies; and to try </line>
         <line>Lieutenant John Geary, the first Lieutenant of the said </line>
         <line>ship, for his conduct upon that occasion. The Court[?] </line>
         <line>was crowded with officers, &amp;c. from the shore each </line>
         <line>day. The prosecution was closed on Saturday after<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nnoon, and the Court adjourned till ten o'clock on Mon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>day, when Lieutenant Geary made his defence. The </line>
         <line>Court having considered the whole of the evidence, were </line>
         <line>of opinion that the charge was proved, and sentenced </line>
         <line>him to be dismissed his Majesty's ship Phaeton, and </line>
         <line>severely reprimanded. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Letters from Port Jackson, New South Wales, dated </line>
         <line>March 30th, were receivedon Sunday. The ships Sur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rey and Lord Sidmouth, with convicts from England, </line>
         <line>arrived on the 4th and 11th March. A schooner of </line>
         <line>80 tons burden, intended for the Chief of the Society </line>
         <line>Islands, was to be launched on the 7th of April. The </line>
         <line>Shipley, with dispatches and troops on board, was to </line>
         <line>sail on the first, and may, therefore, be expected daily </line>
         <line>in this country. </line>

         <line>The mail will convey to you sufficiently afflicting </line>
         <line>news of the voyages which the fever is committing </line>
         <line>amongst us. Part of the 92nd and 50th have made </line>
         <line>their escape on board the Serapis 64, which has been </line>
         <line>roofed to, and most handsomely and humanely given </line>
         <line>up by the Admiral for the use of the troops. The </line>

         <line>The 58th and 81st are scattered[?] ; but from all I can </line>

      <p>
         <line>The scenes that have occurred during this awful </line>
         <line>mortality have been most distressing. It has not been </line>
         <line>confined to the military, for the inhabitants have even </line>
         <line>out numbered them. </line>

         <line>
            <i>The Quebec Mercury</i> of the [?] gives long extracts </line>
         <line>from the American papers, respecting the [?] of a </line>
         <line>large tract of country by the [?] Indians, to the </line>
         <line>British Government, 2,748,000 acres, stretching from </line>
         <line>the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower </line>
         <line>part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements </line>
         <line>on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into </line>
         <line>contact with or approach within many miles of the </line>
         <line>boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition </line>
         <line>that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian ter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ritory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives </line>
         <line>against this country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated </line>
         <line>the 28th September, which mention, that the plague </line>
         <line>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at </line>
         <line>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add </line>
         <line>however, that the deaths at that period were only three </line>
         <line>or four each day, and it was then confined to the </line>
         <line>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen </line>
         <line>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly cold, great hopes were entertained that the further </line>
         <line>progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to </line>
         <line>when trade, which then at a stand, would renew </line>
         <line>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the </line>
         <line>greater part of whom consider it contrary to their reli<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking </line>
         <line>the infection ; and, in the event of their having it </line>
         <line>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any </line>
         <line>means to counteract it. </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The following letter from a lady who emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ted to America, from within four miles of Godal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ming, in Surrey, two years back, has been hand<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to us for insertion. During the present rage </line>
         <line>for emigration, we think we are justified in giv<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing it insertion, leaving it to those who are inte<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rested in its contents to draw their own con </line>
         <line>clusions. We have reason to conclude that the </line>
         <line>letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many </line>
         <line>have been which have found their way into the </line>
         <line>public press, the produce of ingenuity on this </line>
         <line>side the Atlantic: – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818 </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, to<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gether with the patterns you were kind enough to forward </line>
         <line>Although our habits here are in many respects different from </line>
         <line>those on your side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a </line>
         <line>considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for </line>
         <line>English fasions ; and the display which your prompt atten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion to my request has enabled me to make, has procured me </line>
         <line>not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask </line>
         <line>me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing </line>
         <line>hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in </line>
         <line>complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink </line>
         <line>from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any </line>
         <line>things which I may say, to follow my example. It is impossible </line>
         <line>to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise </line>
         <line>it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, </line>
         <line>as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I </line>
         <line>am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result </line>
         <line>of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence of that activity </line>
         <line>and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on </line>
         <line>their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen </line>
         <line>many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from </line>
         <line>having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more </line>
         <line>money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. </line>
         <line>This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost before they </line>
         <line>had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and </line>
         <line>being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and </line>
         <line>they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>spair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to </line>
         <line>follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them </line>
         <line>call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the </line>
         <line>species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order </line>
         <line>to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked </line>
         <line>me on my enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution </line>
         <line>to come to this country in search of that independence which </line>
         <line>I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, </line>
         <line>and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work wo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who </line>
         <line>take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this </line>
         <line>and so will Mrs B. It is, however, no less true than extraordi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence </line>
         <line>for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment </line>
         <line>which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both </line>
         <line>millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the child<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of </line>
         <line>branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes </line>
         <line>have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly </line>
         <line>1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which </line>
         <line>were necessary to make a show. These, combined with the </line>
         <line>attractive titled of " Miss P–, from London,'&amp;c. in a </line>
         <line>few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my </line>
         <line>utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved </line>
         <line>from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respecta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bility. I am thus particular because I know you feel an </line>
         <line>interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know </line>
         <line>is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally fortunate.– </line>
         <line>He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of </line>
         <line>twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from </line>
         <line>Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they </line>
         <line>have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, </line>
         <line>you know, were farmers, and they are now settled in farms </line>
         <line>of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one </line>
         <line>thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came </line>
         <line>out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and </line>
         <line>husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance </line>
         <line>of every description, they finally successed in laying the </line>
         <line>foundation of their own future happiness. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; </line>
         <line>but this must wear off in the course of timeȃother there </line>
         <line>is a roughness and absence of what we call "good manners"/&gt;</line>
         <line>about some of the Americans, not at all congenial to English </line>
         <line>taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; </line>
         <line>and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their </line>
         <line>humours, are really very kind, and disposed to friendly inter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>course. You talk to carrying your family to the Western </line>
         <line>states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer </line>
         <line>and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be </line>
         <line>very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not </line>
         <line>at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present </line>
         <line>comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing but by report. The emigration in that direction has </line>
         <line>been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as </line>
         <line>frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was </line>
         <line>reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>milies here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, </line>
         <line>were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not </line>
         <line>heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the </line>
         <line>Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter </line>
         <line>great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseve<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tural course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty </line>
         <line>and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very </line>
         <line>justly say, is "worth a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can </line>
         <line>be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English </line>
         <line>fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social inter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>course to which an English neighbourhood give encou<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of </line>
         <line>seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries </line>
         <line>of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, </line>
         <line>that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, </line>
         <line>at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own </line>
         <line>family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to </line>
         <line>which, in proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must </line>
         <line>follow. If you could get three or four families with whom </line>
         <line>you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your </line>
         <line>neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ness would be attained. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your land<sh/>

         </line>

            <small_caps>Emigration to Canada</small_caps>. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from </line>
         <line>Canada, to Paisley, and brings very favourable </line>
         <line>intelligence from that country. He is a native </line>
         <line>of Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and </line>
         <line>is going home again, as he calls it, early in the </line>
         <line>spring. This person gives the most satisfactory </line>
         <line>and cheering account of the place, and says his </line>
         <line>chief complaint was the want of society to share </line>
         <line>in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and </line>
         <line>to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of </line>
         <line>his principal reasons for coming here at present </line>
         <line>was hearing of our distressed condition, and </line>
         <line>that he might be able to persuade others to follow his ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ample ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>telligent, and social neighbours. His arrival and </line>
         <line>narrations, combined with other circumstances, </line>
         <line>have been the subject of considerable discussion </line>
         <line>the whole of last week. A strong desire </line>
         <line>for emigration has been manifested, and about </line>
         <line>300 have already subscribed their names, as a </line>
         <line>testimony of their ardour to go away. A peti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion is immediately to be forwarded to his Ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>jesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by </line>
         <line>way of loan or donation, to enable them to carry </line>
         <line>their wishes into execution. This petition, it is </line>
         <line>said, is to be supported by the principal gentle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men of the county, and the utmost anxiety </line>
         <line>will doubtless prevail concerning its success. – </line>
         <line>Let us hope that Government will see the neces<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sity of attending to the supplications of these </line>
         <line>people. The Sheriff Depute has been memoriali<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>zed upon the subject, to give his counsel and sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>port in behalf of the measure, and it is much to </line>
         <line>his honour that he has evinced a great disposition </line>
         <line>to favour the object in view. His office has </line>
         <line>been appointed for the reception of signatures, </line>
         <line>where the persons experience the greatest kind<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ness in every possible way. It is proper, at the </line>
         <line>same time, to mention, that a number who were </line>
         <line>wishing to subscribe as desirous to emigrate, have </line>
         <line>been rejected ; as their circumstances were not </line>
         <line>of that despairing nature as to warrant an inter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>position of this kind in their favour. It cannot </line>
         <line>be expected that those who enjoy a considerable </line>
         <line>degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient </line>
         <line>means of their own to emigrate without public </line>
         <line>aid, ought to be included among that number des<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tined to participate in this salutary and benevo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with </line>
         <line>their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily em<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ployed in jeering and deprecating the idea of </line>
         <line>emigration and telling the " people to stay and </line>
         <line>help" in the recovery of their rights. They de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>clare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tended to be played against them, in order to </line>
         <line>destroy the unanimity which they say exists in </line>
         <line>the nation concerning their grand object. These </line>
         <line>querulous politicians complain of the climate of </line>
         <line>Canada, and it must be granted that it resembles </line>
         <line>Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in sum<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mer and coller in winter than our own island </line>
         <line>but the country is healthy, the soil is fruitful </line>
         <line>and strong constitutions and longevity are as </line>
         <line>common there as in any other part of the globe. </line>
         <line>The same manners, language, and regulations </line>
         <line>prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and </line>
         <line>when people have plenty of provisions, fuel and </line>
         <line>warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows </line>
         <line>and intense frosts, the objection of cold is less </line>
         <line>worthy of consideration. – <i>Glasgow Chronicle</i>. </line>

         <line>Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties </line>

         <line>arrival in that colony, a white man was flagged by a black </line>
         <line>executioner, for having stolen some money from the town<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>house ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the pu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro </line>
         <line>was broken on the wheel for the same crime, and he bore </line>
         <line>that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment af<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terwards, they prepared to hang another, and whilst the </line>
         <line>hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him </line>
         <line>into eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the </line>
         <line>execution. " Having expressed to the persons who were </line>
         <line>near me, (says Captain Stedman) how much I was shock<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed with the injustice and cruelty of those executions, </line>
         <line>and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the </line>
         <line>punishment, a very decent looking man thus addressed </line>
         <line>me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you </line>
         <line>were better acquainted with negro slaves, what you now </line>
         <line>see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It </line>
         <line>is not long since I saw a negro suspended from that very </line>
         <line>gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which </line>
         <line>it was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which </line>
         <line>was passed an iron hook attached to a chain. He lived </line>
         <line>three days suspended in that manner, his head and feet </line>
         <line>hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops </line>
         <line>of water that fell on it, for it rained at the time. The </line>
         <line>sufferer did not, however, utter a groan, and never once </line>
         <line>complained. On the third day, another negro was flogged </line>
         <line>under the gallows, and having cried from pain, the former </line>
         <line>reproached him for his want of courage: " Are you a </line>
         <line>man?" said he to him, " you behave like a child!" – </line>
         <line>A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry </line>
         <line>on the spot taking pity on him, dashed out his brains </line>
         <line>with the butt end of his musquet. " I saw another </line>
         <line>negro quartered," the narrator: " After his </line>
         <line>arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses, an </line>
         <line>iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet </line>
         <line>He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of </line>
         <line>ru,, and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. </line>
         <line>But that which amused us most," continued this monster, </line>
         <line>"was the humour of the fellow, who, when the hangman </line>
         <line>presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for, </line>
         <line>told him to drink first, as he was very much afraid of be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses </line>
         <line>should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on </line>
         <line>the wheel, and young women burnt alive, nothing is more </line>
         <line>common in this colony!"/&gt;</line>

            <small_caps>Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters </line>
         <line>and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured </line>
         <line>a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>act the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement </line>
         <line>by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first trans<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the </line>
         <line>notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction, </line>
         <line>were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth </line>
         <line>reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied </line>
         <line>them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birk<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>beck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own </line>
         <line>endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details regard<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward </line>
         <line>into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our country<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men, when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the </line>
         <line>accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary </line>
         <line>to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World </line>
         <line>and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea </line>
         <line>Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes </line>
         <line>and even luxuries of life to this remote place, still the settlers must </line>
         <line>find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ny privations ; and some details, shewing how the colonists got over </line>
         <line>their difficulties, how their various wants were supplied, and how the </line>
         <line>feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the </line>
         <line>woods and the wilderness, would have been much more interesting </line>
         <line>than a reply to Cobbett's captious objections. One of the most try<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives, an evil </line>
         <line>which happily does not affect the mother country, amidst all her other </line>
         <line>sufferings. The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't </line>

         <line>two publications, an outline of the process of emigration, from its </line>

      <p>
         <line>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning </line>

         <line>woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed </line>
         <line>a road to it;" for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old </line>

         <line>our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent </line>
         <line>objects of building and fencing, of which much has already been </line>

            <small_caps>Proceedings of the Court</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lord Provost <small_caps>Manderston</small_caps> having been called to the Chair, the </line>
         <line>Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results and </line>
         <line>general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensber<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named </line>
         <line>a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to </line>
         <line>the adjourned meeting to be held in February next. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>
            <small_caps>Mr John Witham</small_caps> junior then rose, and requested leave to submit </line>
         <line>a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in </line>
         <line>substance that, though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to </line>
         <line>the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet </line>
         <line>anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction </line>
         <line>that the exertions of the Managers had, at last, placed this valuable </line>
         <line>Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited </line>
         <line>the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an </line>
         <line>interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now </line>
         <line>stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants, </line>
         <line>or of <i>recent patients,</i> the answers were uniformly satisfactory. The </line>
         <line>Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom and the </line>
         <column/>
         <line>medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various </line>
         <line>salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous </line>
         <line>state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court </line>
         <line>and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tal was in a good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not fall to afford </line>
         <line>that assistance to the Managers here, and that security against internal </line>
         <line>abuses, which they had done in so many other similar institutions. It </line>
         <line>was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this spe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cies of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in addition, to visitors of </line>
         <line>our sex, there was a committee of ladies, who visisted the female wards, </line>
         <line>and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great </line>
         <line>advantages had resulted. But in this city we had hospitals for fe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>males, which are governed by men only, without seeking any help </line>
         <line>from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified to discharge </line>
         <line>most of the duties. This view of these matters, he trusted, would yet </line>
         <line>be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the meet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which the city of E<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the Court, and its Ho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>noured Chairman, that this subject was not introduced with the view </line>
         <line>of touching upon, or insinuating any thing respecting the city's af<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fairs. The money, he understood, was secured on the ale duty ; but </line>
         <line>why should the Hospital lose one-half per cent, of interest? He had </line>
         <line>once made a calculation, according to which the loss, from the be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ginning, had amounted to about L.10,000. It had been stated that </line>
         <line>the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to the Hos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding L.59 of interest </line>
         <line>that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the subejct the </line>
         <line>present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital of any </line>
         <line>part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was </line>
         <line>built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, </line>
         <line>by the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>burgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, on condition of paying <i>the interest</i> to the Infirmary, <i>which inte-</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>rest</i>, if paid at two terms in the years, should be restricted to 3 1/2 per </line>
         <line>cent. And as the property tax–which the Town did not retain from </line>
         <line>the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to Government,–is </line>
         <line>now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding the usual rate </line>
         <line>of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several gentle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on interest at </line>
         <line>5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to pay that </line>
         <line>rate of interest. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>
            <small_caps>Mr Alex. Cruishank</small_caps> seconded the motion </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Col. <small_caps>Crichton</small_caps> regretted that the respectable gentlemen
            should have </line>
         <line>introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but </line>
         <line>when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that when his servants </line>
         <line>or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received </line>
         <line>was in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>table citizen, could command in his own house. But he could men<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his </line>
         <line>own – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profes<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion, who lives abroad, and who was recently in this country. That </line>
         <line>professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the </line>
         <line>medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter </line>
         <line>of pride, he said, to every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the </line>
         <line>Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe. </line>
         <line>It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and a </line>
         <line>nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the </line>
         <line>answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tal treatment is, that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh. </line>
         <line>Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at </line>
         <line>the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Chris<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and </line>
         <line>management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration </line>
         <line>and without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do </line>
         <line>he must say, it would be much more creditable to the respectable gen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high o<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pinion of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of oc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cupying the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling </line>
         <line>about trifles, which were every way contemptible. After a pause, </line>
         <line>Col. Crichton made a counter motion, to get rid of Mr Wigham's. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lord <small_caps>Meadowbank</small_caps> reminded the Court, that this matter of
            inte<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rest had already been under the consideration of a Committee, and </line>
         <line>decided on by the Court. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>
            <small_caps>Henry Jardine</small_caps>, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the Town of </line>
         <line>Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last year. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Ritchie</small_caps> rose and said, that though perfectly aware of
            what the </line>
         <line>result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled without </line>
         <line>giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure </line>
         <line>to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trines in such meetings as this,–a change from which he anticipated </line>
         <line>much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject by </line>
         <line>the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him </line>
         <line>that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too tri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional interest of </line>
         <line>the money in question would obviously extend the means of <i>healing</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>the sick</i>, the great object of the Institution. Nothing, indeed, which </line>
         <line>had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord on the other </line>
         <line>side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that <i>five per cent</i> is </line>
         <line>the legal rate of interest, and that the Town of Edinburgh ought not </line>
         <line>to pay less. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if </line>
         <line>Mr W. did not, he would submit a motion, namely, <i>Visitori</i> 'And </line>
         <line>this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides </line>
         <line>of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the measure </line>
         <line>was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management </line>
         <line>was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and </line>
         <line>this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other </line>
         <line>places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and </line>
         <line>much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at </line>
         <line>Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>burgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed, and in the west </line>
         <line>of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial </line>
         <line>here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, </line>
         <line>and that no measure could be carried here without their consent, the </line>
         <line>granting of Visitors would be a <i>boon</i> from themselves. He moved, </line>
         <line>that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act month<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to them </line>
         <line>for the consideration of the Managers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Wigham</small_caps> seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed
            averse </line>
         <line>to entertain it, it was withdrawn. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Ritchie</small_caps> then said, that as his last motion was intended
            chiefly </line>
         <line>as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he would </line>
         <line>also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion which he wish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to submit, but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared </line>
         <line>to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would not be </line>
         <line>said, that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble, or un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>necessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object was the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>motion of medical science, and its nature would be understood by </line>
         <line>his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports of Dr </line>
         <line>Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish </line>
         <line>annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to fur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nish information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the names of </line>
         <line>the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support of </line>
         <line>the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use in marking the </line>
         <line>progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do po<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sitive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as </line>
         <line>utterly without value. This, however, is not the case ; and the re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ports we have of late years received from the Fever Hospitals of </line>
         <line>Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every </line>
         <line>kind and in every place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect this </line>
         <line>information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have </line>
         <column/>
         <line>only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from </line>
         <line>the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads </line>
         <line>us to suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lar as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will </line>
         <line>venture to say, that where it has not yet been practised, its good ef<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional </line>
         <line>points of view, will soon be apparent."–His motion went to carry this </line>
         <line>suggestion into effect ; and without farther preface he should now </line>
         <line>read it. The substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept </line>
         <line>at present, Digest of the whole should be kept in a <i>tabular form</i> but </line>
         <line>especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence </line>
         <line>of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis, termination and as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>signed causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the temperatures and </line>
         <line>moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of staple pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions &amp;c. ; with an annual medical report, taking notice of the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>crease or decrease of population, and of the employment, diet and ha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bits of the labouring classes, as far as practicable. Some of the mem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bers, he observed, seemed to be amused with this enumeration ; but </line>
         <line>the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at. With </line>
         <line>their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish to interfere. They </line>
         <line>knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and honourably. In </line>
         <line>their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary ; but </line>
         <line>their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to preserve </line>
         <line>the results of their skill and experience. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The <small_caps>Lord President</small_caps> said he hoped the gentlemen who had made </line>
         <line>this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time requi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>site to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it would be in an </line>
         <line>hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the Managers had no </line>
         <line>compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time was </line>
         <line>so occupied with their own private avocations. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had </line>
         <line>fallen from the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he </line>
         <line>would beg leave to read another passage from Dr Duncan's volu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ble publication, and which, he hoped, would obviate some of the diffi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culties adverted to. " The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping </line>
         <line>such tabular records, is not so great as might be supposed. It requires </line>
         <line>only system and regularity; and when we see how easily it is done in </line>
         <line>the military hospital, <i>we cannot help regretting that it is not also in-</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>troduced general into civil hospitals.</i> If the practitioner himself has </line>
         <line>not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table, it would be </line>
         <line>very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the time of that assis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tant would not easily permit him, <i>the duty would be very gladly taken</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>by another of the Hospital pupils.</i>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Dr <small_caps>Hope</small_caps>, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the motion.
            The </line>
         <line>Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to every </line>
         <line>proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present, how<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records of </line>
         <line>the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehens<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ion and many talents. It was a task which every one was not qua<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public, </line>
         <line>and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not be </line>
         <line>expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals, </line>
         <line>where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to </line>
         <line>their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for </line>
         <line>making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and </line>
         <line>that these Journals are open to <i>all the medical attendants;</i> so that </line>
         <line>whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance of </line>
         <line>such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and complet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing them. Accordingly we had had the very able reports of Dr </line>
         <line>Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has now </line>
         <line>the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to </line>
         <line>leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents </line>
         <line>of individuals. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The <i>Mover</i> then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr. Welsh's </line>
         <line>judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would </line>
         <line>never have introduced such a measure, had it not been suggested and </line>
         <line>recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or </line>
         <line>that he could do it better, or even so well as many other members of </line>
         <line>the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the </line>
         <line>subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however </line>
         <line>to give unnecessary trouble, and should, therefore, for the present, beg </line>
         <line>leave to withdraw his motion. </line>

         <line>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, </line>
         <line>with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurispru<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dence, has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court "strikes the </line>
         <line>Jury, by taking <i>45</i> after <i>45, until they served in rotation.</i>" They </line>
         <line>consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the High Constables"/&gt;</line>
         <line>for Edinburgh and those "regularly required from the counties of </line>
         <line>Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were <i>then</i> put up<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>on a roll, which was put into the bands of the Clerk of Court;"– </line>
         <line>the Jurors thus struck being cited, not by a Sheriff officer, but by </line>
         <line>a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We are not aware of any law </line>
         <line>which requires the Clerk of Court to take the Jurors by rotation ; </line>
         <line>but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he resorts to this </line>
         <line>unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a virtue </line>
         <line>which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate when </line>
         <line>such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society, honour </line>
         <line>and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when </line>
         <line>the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it </line>
         <line>would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at </line>
         <line>present from principle, into specific rules for directing the conduct </line>
         <line>of their successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is </line>
         <line>about to introduce into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the </line>
         <line>Judicatories of Scotland ; and his Lordship, it is obvious, might </line>
         <line>obtain a well-merited popularity by throwing in some clauses to </line>
         <line>fix the qualifications of a Juror in the different counties of Scot<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land, and to regulate the times and the manner in which lists of </line>
         <line>Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl of 45, and then to </line>
         <line>a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain discretion on </line>
         <line>more than one of these points left with functionaries, who, we </line>
         <line>doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be </line>
         <line>a relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>partial juries than at present, yet, if the ballot were introduced </line>
         <line>here, as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would </line>
         <line>be more coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and </line>
         <line>misrepresentation. It would be no disgrace to Scotland to bor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>row in this respect from her sister kingdom, but an honour which </line>
         <line>France seems willing to do herself at present, and which we very </line>
         <line>lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury Court. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such </line>
         <line>a manner as to exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal </line>
         <line>magnetic phenomena mentioned by Captain Flinders, in his </line>
         <line>voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention to the sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all probability, will </line>
         <line>remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the lo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cal attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus be of </line>
         <line>real advantage to the science of navigation. A drawing of </line>
         <line>this plan (as it will be important to ships of war) has been sent </line>
         <line>to the Admiralty. </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The greater number are decieved; they know no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] of this country. Many leave Great Britain from </line>
         <line>[?] discontents; and such the province is better. </line>
         <line>[?]. Lately the notes of Mr. Birkbeck have ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] much consideration; and all his assertions have </line>
         <line>[?] believed, without investigation. Though I </line>
         <line>[?] [?] a bad man (I know him only from his </line>
         <line>[?] yet he is much to be pitied, for his choice is </line>
         <line>[?]; and by this time he begins to feel it. </line>
         <line>[?] Birkbeck, accustomed to all the comforts, and, </line>
         <line>[?], much of the elegance of life, plunges, </line>
         <line>[?[ family, into a forest, where they have fre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] to sleep under the canopy of heaven with a </line>
         <line>[?]. He is forced to take the axe in his hand, </line>
         <line>[?] in felling the pines of which he is to make </line>
         <line>[?], which he builds at a great distance </line>
         <line>[?] neighbour–opening to a wet plain, in </line>
         <line>[?] and an impenetrable forest in the rear. This </line>
         <line>[?] covered with bark–it has no floor but </line>
         <line>[?] as the surrounding country is flat, there </line>
         <line>[?], and no boards to be had. Mr Birk<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] date not leave home, for any distance, with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] guide; and his children cannot go twenty </line>
         <line>[?] from the house, without being lost. He gets </line>
         <line>[?] pressing of his wants supplied at an enor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mous[?] expense. And now, that he is on his land. </line>
         <line>[?] shall he do; it is covered with trees, or it is </line>
         <line>[?] unhealthy; and if he hire people to work, </line>
         <line>[?] of the farm will never pay them: but </line>
         <line>[?] bae servants, and he is obliged to sit down </line>
         <line>[?] them, and to become their companion. Mr. </line>
         <line>Birkbeck[?], who was accustomed to go from one field </line>
         <line>to another, admiring his crops and his cattle, and </line>
         <line>thing to do but to give the servants their orders </line>
         <line>the day, and saw all his works proceeding as ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] as he wished, now finds himself an insulated </line>
         <line>[?], surrounded by a few miserable fiels, taken </line>
         <line>[?] the bog, and full of musquetoes; his children </line>
         <line>[?] sick from this unhealthy situation; and, in </line>
         <line>[?] severe disease, beyond the reach of medical </line>
         <line>assistance. It is possible to believe that, under such </line>
         <line>circumstances, he does not regret the country he has </line>
         <line>[?]. And let me not be told that the prospect of </line>
         <line>[?]] his children a rich inheritance will turn the </line>
         <line>[?] into sweet–he is not that sort of man; nor do </line>
         <line>[?] any law of nature which urges a parent to </line>
         <line>[?] his own happiness, in order to confer a doubt<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] upon his children. We allow that, after a </line>
         <line>[?], he will be surrounded with neighbours; </line>
         <line>[?] their society is not very agreeable; it is indeed </line>
         <line>[?], as Mr Birkbeck himself admits. After </line>
         <line>[?] his connexions, his country, all his early </line>
         <line>[?] and pleasing recollections, his ease and </line>
         <line>[?] what does he gain? Some landed property, </line>
         <line>[?] he dies in improving, in an unhealthy situa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion[?]. He may not be able to leave a farm to each of his </line>
         <line>children[?]; but of what use will they be if not culti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vated[?]? And he will discover in the bitterness of </line>
         <line>[?], that this legacy is not equal to the placing </line>
         <line>[?] upon a farm, though taken at a rack-rent. </line>
         <line>[?] different the situation of a loyal farer, pos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] of Mr. Birkbeck's substance, if he should </line>
         <line>[?] this province[?]![?] He need not go ten miles from </line>
         <line>[?] settlement, even if he went at once up<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] lands granted him by the crown. But, if he </line>
         <line>[?] an improved farm, his privations will be </line>
         <line>[?] compared to those which he must suffer in </line>
         <line>[?] to the back settlements of the United States, as </line>
         <line>[?] still more fully appear. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with </line>
         <line>[?] possible advantage of soil, neighbourhood, </line>
         <line>[?] climate, emigration to America, a country so </line>
         <line>[?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep and </line>
         <line>[?] consideration. The persons emigrating </line>
         <line>[?] civil in their property, break up all commerce, </line>
         <line>[?], and connexions in the country they are leav<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] and if they find their expectations disappoint<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] the country of their choice, they are ashamed, </line>
         <line>perhaps unable, to return. Emigrants often fail, </line>
         <line>[?] they have never examined their subjects pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] and find, on trial, that they do not possess </line>
         <line>qualities to insure success.–The habits, </line>
         <line>knowledge, and accomodation of manners, </line>
         <line>[?] this new life requires, are not, perhaps, na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] to them–they have not the strength, the </line>
         <line>[?] and perseverance, which their new situation </line>
         <line>[?]. The emigrant is not prepared to meet the </line>
         <line>difficulties[?] which the climate, new manner of living, </line>
         <line>[?] or vermin, may bring upon him; and which, </line>
         <line>[?] of all his exertions, may frequently destroy </line>
         <line>[?]. It is, therefore, the greatest cruelty to </line>
         <line>[?] the matter partially; and, while the advantages </line>
         <line>[?] from the old to the new world are drawn </line>
         <line>[?] most fascinating colours, to conceal the priva<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] and sacrifices which must be made, and the </line>
         <line>[?] of failure which may be opposed to </line>
         <line>of success. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We[?] shall have occasion to prove, by the most un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] the evidence, that Upper Canada offers to emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] advantages, vastly superior to any portion of </line>
         <line>[?] United States; but we would still admonish </line>
         <line>[?] thinking to leave their native country, </line>
         <line>[?] the matter with severe minuteness, not </line>
         <line>[?] away by golden dreams; and to prepare </line>
         <line>[?] should they decide upon going, to meet </line>
         <line>[?] [?] from sickness, from different </line>
         <line>[?], [?] labour, and privations of various </line>
         <line>[?] Yet though no step can be so important as </line>
         <line>[?] leaving one native's country for ever, it is to </line>
         <line>[?] that such a step is taken without due con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?]. The fancy is deluded with goldren dreams; </line>
         <line>farmers[?] in America are owners of the soil on </line>
         <line>[?] they live; they have no rents to pay, no tax<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] their doors; possessing a noble indepen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] they acknowledge no superiority but genius </line>
         <line>[?]. These are high sounding things, but </line>
         <line>[?] than solid. Before a man allows him<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] deluded by them, he should remember, </line>
         <line>[?] no great hardship to pay rent, if his pro<sh/>

         </line>
         <line>termined to emigrate, which various considerations </line>
         <line>may, in particular cases, render prudent, his next </line>
         <line>question is, Where shall he go–to the United States </line>
         <line>or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>grating to be friends to the British constitution; for </line>
         <line>if they are not, there is no question; because level<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lers and democrats will find themselves in a bad </line>
         <line>situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no </line>
         <line>kindred spirits there. But though we can willing<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly spare such as these, to lose good subjects is a </line>
         <line>serious evil to the empire; and to lose them through </line>
         <line>ignorance, and the want of that information which </line>
         <line>it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as </line>
         <line>all evil. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the descrip<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion we mention, would rather prefer to remain un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>due their own government, than to live under and </line>
         <line>swear allegiances to another, provided no greater </line>
         <line>sacrifices were required in going to the one than to </line>
         <line>the other. I am indeed quite certain, that many </line>
         <line>would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice </line>
         <line>for this advantage, so agreeable to their feelings and </line>
         <line>habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is </line>
         <line>required, and that their interest, as well as inclina<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, when duly considerd, will lead them to Upper </line>
         <line>Canada. </line>

      <p>
         <line>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birk<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>beck's authority, that 'no good settlement can be </line>

         <line>From this calculation it is seen, that the settler, </line>
         <line>with his large family, by coming to Upper Canada, </line>
         <line>instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he purchases </line>
         <line>his lands at the same price, saves 928 dollars, which </line>
         <line>will enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, </line>
         <line>stock it, and build a comfortable house; and if he </line>
         <line>be granted the land, instead of purchasing it, there </line>
         <line>is a further saving of 130 dollars. </line>

      <p>
         <line>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's </line>

         <line>command in the market; for, notwithstanding the </line>
         <line>greatness of the first saving in coming to Upper </line>
         <line>Canada, if the markets be inferior it might soon be </line>
         <line>balanced. </line>

         <line>N.B. These prices, taken from Mr. Birkbeck's book, are </line>
         <line>&#x163;50 per cent, above the truth. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From this table it is manifest, that the produce </line>
         <line>raised in Upper Canada sells at an advance of up<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wards of 30 per cent on what the same can be sold </line>
         <line>in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr. Birkbeck's </line>
         <line>prices correct, which they are not, being much too </line>
         <line>high. The vast advantage, therefore, in coming to </line>
         <line>Upper Canada, must appear manifest. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It may by some be said, that the families are too </line>
         <line>numerous, as there are few that consist of ten per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons; but the results will be proportionally the same, </line>
         <line>whatever the number be; and if we suppose them </line>
         <line>to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in </line>
         <line>their own country, they will commonly bring ser<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vants with them, by which the average will be still </line>
         <line>greater. But this is of no moment; the difference </line>
         <line>of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is suf<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficiently clear. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birk<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>beck's farmer, the dearness of all those articles which </line>
         <line>he has to purchase; for his distance from the sea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>coast and market operates in two ways to his disad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from </line>
         <line>are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great </line>
         <line>distance from the place where the articles he deals </line>
         <line>in are procured, will add to the price, when he dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poses of the, the additional expense of bringing, </line>
         <line>and the time lost in procuring them. To him who </line>
         <line>is obliged to take a journey of 1600 miles to procure </line>
         <line>his articles of merchandize, the cost and trouble must </line>
         <line>be very great; and all this he makes the consumer </line>
         <line>pay. The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant </line>
         <line>is obliged to take is a very serious one, compared to </line>
         <line>that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The lat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with </line>
         <line>a smaller capital than the former; because he can </line>
         <line>at any time procure a fresh supply in a few days, </line>
         <line>while the former can lay in a stock of goods only </line>
         <line>once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be </line>
         <line>paid for by the farmers and mechanics, who con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sume the articles imported; the difference to them, </line>
         <line>in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less for </line>
         <column/>
         <line>the articles they sell, and paying more for those they </line>
         <line>purchase will be found to be very great. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but </line>
         <line>the sun he shall get for it, which constitutes the </line>
         <line>farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get enough </line>
         <line>to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the </line>
         <line>farmer; it is to procure the means of converting his </line>
         <line>log-cabin into a handsome and convenient house– </line>
         <line>to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable build<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ings for his cattle–to educate his children–and, </line>
         <line>as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding </line>
         <line>that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, </line>
         <line>and enabled him to satisfy the wants of society– </line>
         <line>wants to which we are indebted for amelioration </line>
         <line>of mankind.' </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the selection of a place to residence in a new </line>
         <line>country, it is very important to take into view the </line>
         <line>ultimate market for the farmer's produce. While </line>
         <line>the country is settling, there will be no difficulty; </line>
         <line>for the increasing population will demand all the </line>
         <line>supplies that can be raised. But the prudent set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tler will look beyond that period, and consider what </line>
         <line>he shall do when every one raises more grain than </line>
         <line>he will be able to consume. In that case, vicinity </line>
         <line>to market, and facility of transportation, are all im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portant. Now, the produce of Upper Canada can </line>
         <line>be sent to Montreal, one of the best markets in A<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>merica in five or six days, at a trifling expense, </line>
         <line>which is yearly diminishing as the waters are im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>proved. Very different is the case with the farmer </line>
         <line>in the western division of the United States: the im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions </line>
         <line>the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and </line>
         <line>sometimes exceed, the price offered when it reaches </line>
         <line>the market. The more that this statement is exa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mined, the more correct it will be found, and the </line>
         <line>superior advantages of Canada will appear in a strong<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>er light; but, having been a landholder, it is time </line>
         <line>to instruct the emigrant how he is to make his living </line>
         <line>out of it. </line>

         <line>land. Whenever he finds he can subsist upon </line>

            <small_caps>here</small_caps> wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to </line>
         <line>doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten </line>
         <line>or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound and na<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a </line>
         <line>corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy </line>
         <line>anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the pic<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of </line>
         <line>the full measure of distress and misery which have at length </line>
         <line>fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the </line>
         <line>Government with any more of these evils than might have </line>
         <line>been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment accountable for all that it can remove or prevent, and </line>
         <line>yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dern history, when the evil of an excess, of population has come </line>
         <line>so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for </line>
         <line>a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the </line>
         <line>course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a </line>
         <line>season of bold experiments, in which we surmounted many </line>
         <line>difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our </line>
         <line>hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the world </line>
         <line>may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has </line>
         <line>been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of </line>
         <line>the pockets of the people, but that, when a period of public </line>
         <line>calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind, it is start<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>led by the smallest difficulty, and will not even make such </line>
         <line>a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lated into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly </line>
         <line>we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty </line>
         <line>millions of the capital of the country being annually melted </line>
         <line>down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duced by the depreciation of the currency. The great de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mand for labour, arising out of this state of things, with the </line>
         <line>consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid augmentation in </line>
         <line>the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811, the </line>
         <line>rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the </line>
         <line>population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing </line>
         <line>districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. </line>
         <line>When the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of </line>
         <line>our commercial monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, </line>
         <line>and the diminuition of the paper issues, the sources of our fic<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>titious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took </line>
         <line>place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with </line>
         <line>prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled, and one<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> third added to their real amount by the rise in the value of </line>
         <line>money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication </line>
         <line>of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a </line>
         <line>long period necessarily elapses before the population accom<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>modates itself to the diminished demand for labour, and dur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sery. In this state we are at present, and time, from which </line>
         <line>we hoped relief, has only aggravated the evil. There are but </line>
         <line>three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed </line>
         <line>– a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial </line>
         <line>system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first, </line>
         <line>since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no </line>
         <line>disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we </line>
         <line>have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The </line>
         <line>reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice </line>
         <line>the interest of some particular classes, might be considered as </line>
         <line>a prudent caution, were it not observed, that when, instead of </line>
         <column/>
         <line>relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the </line>
         <line>necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but </line>
         <line>the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar cla<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mour. But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at </line>
         <line>large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ther with a bad grace, when we can no longer hold our mono<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poly, it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to </line>
         <line>open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers </line>
         <line>half a century ago. In our present circumstances, we may </line>
         <line>perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has </line>
         <line>impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dundant population, that we are rather surprised there should </line>
         <line>be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not </line>
         <line>be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the ne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cessity which produces it. " The <i>vis intertiae</i> of people in ge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>neral, says <small_caps>Malthus</small_caps>, and their attachment to their homes, </line>
         <line>are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured </line>
         <line>they will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>treme poverty, they are in such a state, <i>as will make it as much</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>should go out of it.</i>" We by no means underrate the difficul<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but these are </line>
         <line>partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom </line>
         <line>we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most </line>
         <line>pressing object is to send them where they will find the means </line>
         <line>of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our </line>
         <line>own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to </line>
         <line>the United States, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New </line>
         <line>Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the advantage to this </line>
         <line>country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries </line>
         <line>of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half </line>
         <line>a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps </line>
         <line>of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conduct<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important </line>
         <line>to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced </line>
         <line>that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great </line>
         <line>numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn </line>
         <line>would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, </line>
         <line>assured of finding abundance of labourers, would have gone </line>
         <line>out and settled, and provided employment for those who have </line>
         <line>not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm </line>
         <line>we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by </line>
         <line>the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many </line>
         <line>other advantges must be combined with the possession of </line>
         <line>mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the </line>
         <line>former are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our </line>
         <line>capital, our improved means of internal communication, our </line>
         <line>coal fields, our laws for the protection of industry and proper<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty, the free, enlightened and active spirit of our people, with the </line>
         <line>powers of combination resulting from the union of so many </line>
         <line>advantages within so small a space, are better securities for </line>
         <line>our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must be </line>
         <line>nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. </line>
         <line>But the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the su<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>periority of our people in every branch of industry, will have </line>
         <line>this good effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable </line>
         <line>reception. Though the emigration, to afford any sensible re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lief to the whole country, would require to be upon an exten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sive scale, it is yet obvious, that even upon the smallest scale </line>
         <line>it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small </line>
         <line>village, or fifty from a country town, the situation of either </line>
         <line>will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government </line>
         <line>of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fif<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>teen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict </line>
         <line>the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away </line>
         <line>men who are still able to subsist by their labour, others now </line>
         <line>living on charity get employment, we are in effect relieved of </line>
         <line>so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave </line>
         <column/>
         <line>the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon </line>
         <line>become paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to </line>
         <line>pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad, than to </line>
         <line>maintain them permanently home. It is in vain, however, </line>
         <line>to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an </line>
         <line>undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; </line>
         <line>and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ney destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, </line>
         <line>we have no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that </line>
         <line>even so great a sum as five millions were required, this is but </line>
         <line>the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; </line>
         <line>and what is such a sum, if it were to afford certain relief on </line>
         <line>an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should </line>
         <line>again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we should </line>
         <line>quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few </line>
         <line>hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how </line>
         <line>easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing </line>
         <line>more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two </line>
         <line>years, which Mr <small_caps>Vansittart</small_caps> allots for paying off the
            nation<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>al debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and </line>
         <line>creditable to divert a part, or the whole of the actual Sinking </line>
         <line>Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think, that it is lit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tle less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis </line>
         <line>with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. </line>
         <line>Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that </line>
         <line>the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its </line>
         <line>nature, cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. </line>
         <line>We have not only an excess of population to dispose of, but </line>
         <line>we have to check the principle of increase, which is rapidly </line>
         <line>aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810, the po<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pulation of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers </line>
         <line>annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same </line>
         <line>for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 indi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>viduals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the </line>
         <line>whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present </line>
         <line>excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how </line>
         <line>is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish </line>
         <line>more than one-third, or famine and disease must destroy a </line>
         <line>quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the u<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate toge<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ther. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring </line>
         <line>classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is </line>
         <line>not still on the increase, and whether still more afflicting </line>
         <line>scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed, unless measures are taken </line>
         <line>to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> laws give to the increase of population, the most abundant e<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather </line>
         <line>discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in </line>
         <line>some way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>come rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or </line>
         <line>two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of </line>
         <line>their means of subsistence by events over which they had no </line>
         <line>control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to despera<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden revulsion in trade– </line>
         <line>a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cans,–any of those numerous casualties, in short to which e<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>very nation is exposed, would place us in a situation frightful </line>
         <line>to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and </line>
         <line>capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent, </line>
         <line>experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce </line>
         <line>no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief </line>
         <line>which is may ultimately bring, will be obtained only through </line>
         <line>the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In </line>
         <line>the fifth year of peace, it is now time to look the evil in the </line>
         <line>face, and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal, </line>
         <line>or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is </line>
         <line>in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those </line>
         <line>who propose to leave things to what they call the course of </line>
         <line>nature, are in substance recommending that thousands of their </line>
         <line>fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect </line>
         <line>of absolute want. That such a thing should take place in the </line>

         <line>Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated </line>
         <line>22d November, 1819:--"An afflicting circumstance </line>
         <line>has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, </line>
         <line>a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board </line>
         <line>his ship, which was about to sail for England. The </line>
         <line>party was very small, and more than half were taken </line>
         <line>ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I </line>
         <line>buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after </line>
         <line>it; not less than ten of the part died within as many </line>
         <line>days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives </line>
         <line>of those who left England in the ship, and he is just </line>
         <line>recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures </line>
         <line>were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 </line>
         <line>undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete </line>

         </line>
         <line>Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from </line>
         <line>the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queens<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>berry, praying that a fourth more of their claims might be </line>
         <line>paid, there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the </line>
         <line>Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000 </line>
         <line>accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in </line>
         <line>Bank stock, for the benefit of the claimants, and he un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>derstood it was not intended to oppose the application, al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>though the executors did not say they would give their </line>
         <line>consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the </line>
         <line>subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer </line>
         <line>of the petition should be granted. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>structions, nor had he been consulted. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of </line>
         <line>their respective clients. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and </line>
         <line>said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be </line>
         <line>put in a train of settlement. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing </line>
         <line>that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and </line>
         <line>annuities to be paid ; but, said his Lordship, the Marquis </line>
         <line>of Queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery </line>
         <line>of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a </line>
         <line>right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court </line>
         <line>should see that no harm arose to the executors, before the </line>
         <line>funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to </line>
         <line>their not opposing the petition, that was very different to </line>
         <line>consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, " Mind you </line>
         <line>do right."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth </line>
         <line>was too much, they would take an eight, or any part his </line>
         <line>Lordship pleased. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on </line>
         <line>the paper for Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will </line>
         <line>look over the petition. </line>

         <line>We have great pleasure in publishing the following </line>
         <line>interesting letter from India: – </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. </line>
         <line>"I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to </line>
         <line>communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the </line>
         <line>legitimate object of all Government, it is good to learn </line>
         <line>that British India is at peace, and that a temperate </line>
         <line>and radical reform is gradually going on under the </line>
         <line>Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of schools, and a free press, are the moving prin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciples by which this great advancement in the state of </line>
         <line>society will be accomplished, unless checked by im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pious powers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary </line>
         <line>here to dilate. Suffice it to observe, that it is in the </line>
         <line>power of any Government, abitrary or free, to educate </line>
         <line>the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance </line>
         <line>them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in <i>the</i>

         <line>
            <i>shortest</i> possible period. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The establishment of a <i>free press in Asia</i> is, in my </line>
         <line>estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever </line>
         <line>adorned the biography of any Statesman. What, say </line>
         <line>its detractors, is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils </line>
         <line>so great an act? No, but setting loose all the intel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ligence of the age to work upon the public mind and </line>
         <line>conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it </line>
         <line>asserted that a free press is only applicable to an ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vanced state of society, I deny the position ; it is not </line>
         <line>founded in reason or experience. I contend on the </line>
         <line>other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil </line>
         <line>exist, there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and </line>
         <line>I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education </line>
         <line>and a free press. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of </line>
         <line>India, has, in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta, </line>
         <line>been accused of having sent two persons of the name of </line>
         <line>Hastings, to <i>unhealthy</i> climates, the one to the East </line>
         <line>and the other to the West Indies, where they <i>died ;</i>
         </line>
         <line>and for the <i>base</i> purpose of securing to his family the </line>
         <line>title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was </line>
         <line>touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it </line>
         <line>would seem as if some one inimical to a free press, had </line>
         <line>introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this </line>
         <line>virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, al<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood </line>
         <line>refuted in every bosom, and his manly forbearance </line>
         <line>tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to </line>
         <line>our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made </line>
         <line>on Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, </line>
         <line>they say, of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate, </line>
         <line>
            <i>who desired him to have recourse to the law</i> Conceive </line>
         <line>not, however, that I am the advocate for a licentious </line>
         <line>press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well </line>
         <line>applied, beneficial, in proportion to its strength. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, </line>
         <line>Governor of Bombay, has done away with the Censor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ship of the Press. This wise Statesman, being a friend </line>
         <line>to freedom, and having <i>experienced</i> the benefits which </line>
         <line>had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a </line>
         <line>day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light </line>
         <line>by the press), adopted it the moment he came into </line>
         <line>power, and thus proved himself a public benefactor. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the </line>
         <line>diffusion of knowledge, through the medium of educa<sh/>

         <line>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, </line>
         <line>by the Blossom sloop of War, of a curious nature.– </line>
         <line>They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for </line>
         <line>placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head </line>
         <line>of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– </line>
         <line>The circumstance has been brought to light by the late </line>
         <line>changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From </line>
         <line>the documents now published, and received by the </line>
         <line>Blossom, it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the </line>
         <line>Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris, was invited to a </line>
         <line>conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for </line>
         <line>Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolida<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of the Independent Government of South Ame<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rica. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>This project, the French Minister observed, would </line>
         <line>meet with the decided approbation of the Continental </line>
         <line>Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain </line>
         <line>might not like it, but yet would not find any good pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would </line>
         <line>yield to the influence of all Europe with the better </line>
         <line>grace, as his former dependencies would be only trans<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ferred to a branch of his own family. The King of </line>
         <line>France would furnish assistance of every king, and em<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ploy every means, even to the supply of troops, for car<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rying the affair into execution. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of </line>
         <line>his conference reached Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then </line>
         <line>Director <i>ad interim</i> made a secret communication to </line>
         <line>the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter of the </line>
         <line>Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the </line>
         <line>following day, and on the 3d of November, the matter </line>
         <line>was discussed in secret meetings, and the result was an[?] </line>
         <line>opinion, that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed </line>
         <line>no alteration to be made in the form of Government </line>
         <line>till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch </line>
         <line>of the Bourbon family, so closely connected with the </line>
         <line>reigning Monarch of Spain, was in itself an insuperable </line>
         <line>objection, as also the consideration that the Prince </line>
         <line>proposed and supported by the Powers of the Euro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pean Continent, would naturally more incline towards </line>
         <line>the views of his protectors than towards those of South </line>
         <line>America, which ought to avoid all connexion with Eu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ropean continental politics ; and that Great Britain was </line>
         <line>the power from which South America had most to </line>
         <line>fear, and most to expect. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in </line>
         <line>Europe shoud put the communications from Paris in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>to the hands of the British Minstry, whose good opi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nion and protection South America is most anxious to </line>
         <line>conciliate. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cans with the greatest reserve, as if feating contamina<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terests and feelings which appears in itself commenda<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ble, but, when measured by the standard of national </line>
         <line>benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it </line>
         <line>would seem that the British interest is likely to gain </line>
         <line>the ascendacy in the river Plate, rather through the </line>
         <line>disposition of the inhabitants, than from any influence </line>
         <line>exerted by our Ministers. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was </line>
         <line>carried on by the Duke de Cazes, the project did not </line>
         <line>originate with him, and did not at first apply to the </line>
         <line>Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for </line>
         <line>one more nearly allied to the reigning family in </line>
         <line>France. </line>

         <line>of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sin<sh/>

         <line>commanded by his Excellency the Commander in </line>
         <line>Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the </line>

         </line>

         <line>The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and </line>

         <line>favourable to their views, are the most irritated against </line>
         <line>the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th </line>

         <line>him from sending emissaries into the interior, and col<sh/>

         <line>one an English, and the other a French, were prepar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing to sail from Callao for this place, and by them we </line>
         <line>shall receive further particulars. The most enthusias<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the </line>
         <line>constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose </line>
         <line>orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself </line>
         <line>is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Mar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tin may have on the country, except, as before, a lit<sh/>

         <line>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. </line>
         <line>mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– </line>
         <line>The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and Thistle, were </line>
         <line>lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was oblig<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of </line>
         <line>her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from </line>
         <line>the River Gambia, whither she had proceeded in dread </line>
         <line>of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. </line>
         <line>A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, </line>
         <line>by the merchants of that colony, for the very able man<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the </line>
         <line>differences between the Native Chiefs and the British </line>
         <line>interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from </line>
         <line>the Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belong<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing to the mission under Major Gray, for exploring </line>
         <line>Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in conse<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed </line>
         <line>further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; </line>
         <line>he will not proceed further for some time. </line>

         <line>At four o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. </line>
         <line>we had a violent shock of an earthquake, which lasted </line>

            <small_caps>Emigration to Canada</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman </line>
         <line>belonging to Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nada, to a friend in this city :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"<i>York, Upper Canada, 14th November</i>, 1820. </line>
         <line>"You wish to be informed of the encouragement that you </line>
         <line>might meet with by an emigration to this country; and as </line>
         <line>you have determined to place the most implicit confidence </line>
         <line>in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you the </line>
         <line>"truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me <i>God</i>."– </line>
         <line>In the first place, you wish to know what might be the va<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lue of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of </line>
         <line>improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation </line>
         <line>where you wish to purchase; but I may with safety aver<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>age wild land, in this Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lars per acre, and the clearing or improving of each acre </line>
         <line>will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.–In the next place, you </line>
         <line>wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been </line>
         <line>known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can </line>
         <line>be purchased at 20 dollars, a pair of working oxen at 40 </line>
         <line>dollars; a good cart horse at 50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars a<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> piece. In regard to farming utensils, there are but few </line>
         <line>used in this country at any time, and a new settler may be </line>
         <line>some years in the woods before we want any more than an </line>
         <line>axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government </line>
         <line>grant; that has now become no object, as the charges made </line>
         <line>by Government exceed in many cases what you can pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chase land for; and by buying land you have the advan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tage of choosing a situation agreeable to your mind; but </line>
         <line>the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernment, for you must then take your chance by drawing </line>
         <line>by lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty </line>
         <line>miles round this place, you will then be obliged to go back </line>
         <line>into the woods, and out of the world. You are at liberty </line>
         <line>to sell it as soon as you receive the grant; formerly you </line>
         <line>could.–You wish to know what sum you could estab<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one </line>
         <line>thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and </line>
         <line>difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend, </line>
         <line>I would advise you not to think of leaving home with a </line>
         <line>sum less than &#x163;200 sterling with a sum less than this you </line>
         <line>undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and troubles </line>
         <line>that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here </line>
         <line>for nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my </line>
         <line>pend to describe; and my greatest enemy I should not ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vise to come to this country, with the intention of farming, </line>
         <line>with less capital than I have no stated to you. Many </line>
         <line>may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams </line>
         <line>about this country; but you must allow the experience that </line>
         <line>I have had to outweigh the statements of many that you </line>
         <line>may have had an opportunity of talking with, who may pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tend to have some knowledge of this country, for there </line>
         <line>are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls of </line>
         <line>Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not </line>
         <line>visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may </line>
         <line>think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine </line>
         <line>myself to wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article </line>
         <line>in this country; and should you think of farming, I would </line>
         <line>advise you to bring but few fine clothes, but principally </line>
         <line>coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind becomes very </line>
         <line>expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as </line>
         <line>this, and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of </line>
         <line>the repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the trans<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portation of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) </line>
         <line>is 2 dollars per cwt.; and from Kingston to York (200 </line>
         <line>miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel bulk; and from </line>
         <line>Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for </line>
         <line>each grown person.–By the by, you wish to know the po<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pulation of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to </line>
         <line>some of your towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of </line>
         <line>York might amount to 3000 people. But there is no place </line>
         <line>that I have visited in my travels that is more thriving than </line>
         <line>this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is now </line>
         <line>twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three </line>
         <line>years), and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; </line>
         <line>but all wood.–You wish to know the different branches of </line>
         <line>business carried on here. They are principally house car<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>penters; and various other mechanics are also employed </line>
         <line>here.–You wish to know if any of the emigrants have ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rived in this place. There are but very few I understand </line>
         <line>come thus far, the greater part of them having stopped at a </line>
         <line>settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. </line>
         <line>–Since I have now given answers to all your different </line>
         <line>queries, let me now give my candid opinion respecting this </line>
         <line>country. In the first instance, a farmer may live by hard </line>
         <line>labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a </line>
         <line>complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the </line>
         <line>farmer of this country; and in some places you may live </line>
         <line>for years and not even behold, a silver dollar through a glass </line>
         <line>darkly, as all is done by barter in the country. The next </line>
         <line>evil is the mixture of society; a very few good, intermixed </line>
         <line>with a multitude of a very different character; but in many </line>
         <line>places you will be divested of all society, either of a good </line>
         <line>or bad quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you </line>
         <line>will find yourself uncomfortable, in consequence of its </line>
         <line>being so much different to what you have been accus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tomed to; and the opportunity of spending the sabbath </line>
         <line>in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And </line>
         <line>above all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is </line>
         <line>the ruin of many a family in this country. But should </line>
         <line>you think of coming to this country, in order to avoid this </line>
         <line>disease I would advise you to come no farther up the coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness </line>
         <line>is seldom known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated </line>
         <line>here I neither mean to advise or dissuade you from com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing to this country; but take it into serious consideration </line>
         <line>before you embark upon this important."/&gt;</line>

         <line>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. </line>
         <line>The active exertions of the Governor to improve the </line>
         <line>inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. </line>
         <line>In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parlia<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less </line>
         <line>than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhou<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sie, to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the </line>
         <line>allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respect<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from </line>
         <line>Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained </line>
         <line>by the people of Canada, during the late war. His </line>
         <line>excellency the Governor had intimated, that no objec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2,500l </line>
         <line>on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided </line>
         <line>the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> General, and that of the Speaker of the House of As<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sembly, should be continued, in the whole amounting </line>
         <line>to 1,800l. The grant has for some time been a pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>minent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parlia<sh/>

         <line>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in </line>
         <line>Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for Eng<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Otta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing </line>
         <line>the obstructions in that river. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that </line>
         <line>a messenger was leaving that place to announce the </line>
         <line>union of the North and Hudson's Bay Compa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nies, at their respective establishments. The former </line>
         <line>of these companies was under control of Lord Sel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>kirk, and the schism that has so long reigned between </line>
         <line>them, with its fatal consequences, is well know to </line>
         <line>the Public. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships </line>
         <line>have been taken up by the vigilant Governor, on board </line>
         <line>of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to the </line>
         <line>Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the </line>
         <line>surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>der the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. </line>
         <line>Lionel Smith has been selected for this important ser<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vice ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince </line>
         <line>the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceed<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ings, and justify the high confidence which the Go<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>"We arrived here on the 27th inst. all in good health.– </line>
         <line>This colony surpasses my expectation–climate very simi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lar to England, soil capable of any thing, where an industrious </line>

         <line>mount of from 400 to 2000 acres given them, generally of ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cellent quality. This colony in fact is the only country that </line>
         <line>an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate </line>
         <line>not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the </line>
         <line>same, except burning wood for coals. The country on the </line>
         <line>sea coast is very woody, but much easier cleared than Ame<sh/>

         <line>rica and about ten miles in the interior several miles of ex<sh/>

         <line>twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor </line>

         <line>Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, </line>
         <line>R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate of the ship </line>
         <line>Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, </line>
         <line>29th November 1820 :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the </line>
         <line>ship Guildford, which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and </line>
         <line>then homewards. We left the Table Bay on 18th October, </line>
         <line>and arrived here on 28th November, making a very good </line>
         <line>passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the </line>
         <line>island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went </line>
         <line>ashore on the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours, </line>
         <line>found it to be barren entirely–only inhabited by give or six </line>
         <line>people from the Isle of France, for the purpose of sealing. </line>
         <line>When we came near the land, fell in with various winds </line>
         <line>and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve o'clock, </line>
         <line>and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The </line>
         <line>country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but </line>
         <line>interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here </line>
         <line>now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>larly built, just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden </line>
         <line>houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly </line>
         <line>of the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy </line>
         <line>Governor was very favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to </line>
         <line>be here from Sidney in the course of a fortnight or three </line>
         <line>weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers </line>
         <line>are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves </line>
         <line>to Sydney, or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; </line>
         <line>coarse ship biscuits 35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, </line>
         <line>21s. and every thing in like proportion. Salted pork would </line>
         <line>have sold very well–could clear L130 a cwt. Beef is about </line>
         <line>6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you pay </line>
         <line>more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, </line>
         <line>they were mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement </line>
         <line>here for pickpockets. Some of the richest and most power<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful men here have once been sent out as convicts, but, from </line>
         <line>their good behaviour, got their emancipation. The Midship </line>
         <line>Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig </line>
         <line>trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me </line>
         <line>they can chuse what land they like ; but not the quality ; they </line>
         <line>must apply the saw and the hatchet a great deal. A hatchet </line>
         <line>costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have female servants, as they </line>
         <line>can't trust them ; as those who come out are convicts, and </line>
         <line>get soon married, so they have all men servants."/&gt;</line>

         <line>New York, May 8. </line>
         <line>The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at </line>
         <line>Stonington, last Tuesday, in seventy-three days </line>
         <line>from New South Iceland, with a cargo of oil. </line>
         <line>ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S. long. 35. W. </line>
         <line>spokethe Brig Wilner, of London, from Buenos </line>
         <line>Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the Cap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian </line>
         <line>army, near Peru, had fought two battles with the </line>
         <line>Royal army, in both of which the Chilian army </line>
         <line>was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause </line>
         <line>the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>May 15. </line>
         <line>The gigantic projects that occupy the atten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of our countrymen are truly surprising. A </line>
         <line>plan is now forming, for example, to establish a </line>
         <line>settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, </line>
         <line>for the purpose of importing teas direct from the </line>
         <line>East Indies. It is then proposed to transport </line>
         <line>this article of merchandize up the Columbia, un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>til it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to </line>
         <line>proceed by land to the navigable branch of the </line>
         <line>Missouri. This embraces a space of three </line>
         <line>hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tance 200 miles are represented by travellers as </line>
         <line>constituting an excellent road ; the remaining </line>
         <line>one hundred and forty comprehend the moun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tain barrier, which must be passed by the intre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pidity and labour of man. The merchandize </line>
         <line>will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its </line>
         <line>subsidiary streams, supply the whole western </line>
         <line>continent with the refreshing beverage. This </line>
         <line>shows the varied changes of commerse ; the </line>
         <line>Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium </line>
         <line>of supplying our western States with the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ductions of China ; but if this plan should be </line>
         <line>carried into effect, we may receive our supply </line>
         <line>from that country through the western States. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>May 16. </line>
         <line>It is worthy of remark, that among the nu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>merous arrivals at this port yesterday, were three </line>
         <line>British brigs from Dundee. This makes good </line>

            <small_caps>Africa.</small_caps>–Extract of a Letter from Capt. Colliver, </line>
         <line>a Gentlemen belonging to the county of Cornwall, </line>
         <line>and who is an Officer in the service of the African </line>
         <line>Comapny:– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. </line>
         <line>By the time you have received this, it is probable the </line>
         <line>African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have </line>
         <line>received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver </line>
         <line>up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It </line>
         <line>is understood they are to be put on the same footing as </line>
         <line>Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment by the Company's Committee, of their Officers, </line>
         <line>their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; </line>
         <line>their emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, </line>
         <line>since the 10th of February, by the Ashantees[?] (an Afri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>can tribe), who have commenced hostilities against us. </line>
         <line>On the day before mentioned, our Governor received </line>
         <line>intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, </line>
         <line>where the people are under our protection, had been </line>
         <line>cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?], at a place </line>
         <line>about six miles from Cape Coast, called Moree[?]. I was </line>
         <line>immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I </line>
         <line>could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize </line>
         <line>the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and </line>
         <line>85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of </line>
         <line>Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in </line>
         <line>number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains </line>
         <line>of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the </line>
         <line>top of a hill, on the summit of which is an old Dutch </line>
         <line>Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was </line>
         <line>opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the </line>
         <line>murderer, if possible, without bloodshed, I did not for </line>
         <line>some time allow the men to return the fire. However, </line>
         <line>perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave di<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rections to my little party to give them a volley and </line>
         <line>then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, </line>
         <line>and in less than an hour we gained the hill, from which </line>
         <line>our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded </line>
         <line>the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging </line>
         <line>to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mained, and who immediately gave them up. In the </line>
         <line>fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were perfectly se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cure from the attack of the negroes. The body we de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>feated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the </line>
         <line>Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands </line>
         <line>made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon </line>
         <line>as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast, learned </line>
         <line>that the Governor had sent an armed force against their </line>
         <line>friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened </line>
         <line>after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents </line>
         <line>before they arrived. However, they rallied the Fan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tees, and took a position about half a mile from the </line>
         <line>town, with a determination to oppose our little party. </line>
         <line>The Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled </line>
         <line>all the forces he could muster, and speedily about 500 </line>
         <line>of the Cape Coast people, headed by our officers, and </line>
         <line>carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The </line>
         <line>enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from </line>
         <line>our disagreeable situation, after having been from nine </line>
         <line>in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a </line>
         <line>burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had </line>
         <line>47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; </line>
         <line>we had one soldier killed, and four wounded. Since </line>
         <line>the affair, we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the </line>
         <line>Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken </line>
         <line>place. We have not learned how the King of Ashan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tee intends to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our </line>
         <line>limits, except in large parties. </line>

         <line>descend in bands to commit their depredations. By </line>

         <line>Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous. The </line>
         <line>whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one </line>
         <line>family being well, and in many instances not one to </line>
         <line>assist another. So dreadful, indeed, is the disease, </line>
         <line>that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New </line>
         <line>York Paper of the 30th ult. says– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We are sorry to perceive from the <i>Franklin Gazette</i>, </line>
         <line>that the malignant fever continues to make serious ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four </line>
         <line>full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday </line>

         <line>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Ga<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>zettes, an account of the dreadful drought which had </line>
         <line>prevailed in that island for more than twelve months </line>
         <line>and the consequences of which had been most calami<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tous. We are now, however, most happy, in being </line>
         <line>able to state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who </line>
         <line>left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our </line>
         <line>preceding advices, that this terible evil, in such a cli<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mate particularly, had at length ceased. The follow<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing is the substance of the information which has been </line>
         <line>communicated to us:– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"A few hours previous to my going on board the </line>
         <line>Jamaica packet, on the 3d of September, the rain fell </line>
         <line>in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to </line>
         <line>the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general </line>
         <line>throughout the district of Liguanea. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the </line>
         <line>present, or, perhaps, the ensuing year, this seasonable </line>
         <line>change of weather would at least have the effect of </line>
         <line>staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those </line>
         <line>interested in the island will receive the intelligence </line>
         <line>with gratification. On some properties, the canes had </line>
         <line>been cut as fodder to save the stock."/&gt;</line>

         </line>
         <line>tents, it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding </line>
         <line>there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of </line>
         <line>the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor </line>
         <line>is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing </line>
         <line>from it all the base metal, and substituting gold and </line>
         <line>silver of standard value. </line>

         <line>The <i>Gazette of Dordrecht</i> publishes accounts from </line>
         <line>Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of </line>
         <line>the decrease of the malady, and mention, that it was </line>
         <line>almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang, </line>
         <line>but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fal<sh/>

         <line>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with </line>
         <line>you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease </line>
         <line>the difficulties of Old England, which we read of here, </line>
         <line>we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to </line>
         <line>this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duction and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the </line>
         <line>English printed cottons are now carried in considerable </line>
         <line>quantities as far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if </line>
         <line>they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are </line>
         <line>so far from being overstocked, that before the arrival of </line>
         <line>two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all Euro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pean articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold </line>
         <line>about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns </line>
         <line>the ld ; a common round hat, three guineas. These, </line>
         <line>undoubtedly, were prices arising from an unusual scarci<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading, </line>
         <line>which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggera<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of price and profit. Government bonds are now at </line>
         <line>six per cent premium, though they bear but half the </line>
         <line>usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable </line>
         <line>evidence of the credit of the Company and the Govern<sh/>

         <line>ment. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hin<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>The following is an extract of a letter dated </line>
         <line>Louisville, August 12th, 1820, from a Scotchman </line>
         <line>who has been ong settled in America, to his friend, </line>
         <line>a Scotch Farmer, who rents 500 acres of land in the </line>
         <line>County of Middlesex. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The circumstances in which this country is </line>
         <line>placed at present are truly melancholy, when com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pared to what they have been ; yet still it is a better </line>
         <line>country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to </line>
         <line>make money by farming, at present, in the United </line>
         <line>States, for the want of a market; and I am of opi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nion that things will not mend, in this respect, for </line>
         <line>some years, for all are sellers and none buyers. All </line>
         <line>kinds of produce are selling, or rather offered for </line>
         <line>sale, at one-third of what prices were two years ago. </line>
         <line>Land, of course, has fallen in the same ratio. The </line>
         <line>best of cleared land, within from 5 to 10 miles of </line>
         <line>this town, is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an </line>
         <line>acre. You will thence conclude that this is a fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vourable time to purchase – and that for a man </line>
         <line>who has a little money, and a large family able and </line>
         <line>willing to labour with their hands, this is a most </line>
         <line>excellent country, as he can easily raise on this cheap </line>
         <line>land all the necessaries, and many of the luxuries, of </line>
         <line>life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver, </line>
         <line>or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot </line>
         <line>be badly off with more beef, mutton, pork and </line>
         <line>grain, than he can dispose of. He has no rent to </line>
         <line>make up by term day: his taxes are next to no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing, and although he may grumble to have to turn </line>
         <line>his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing it, or to see his apples rotting under his trees by </line>
         <line>barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them, </line>
         <line>yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those </line>
         <line>of the poor farmers in our native land, and as I sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change </line>
         <line>is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he </line>
         <line>stays long in Britain he will soon become less weal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. </line>
         <line>He would miss many things made necessary by habit; </line>
         <line>he would find his servants more lazy, and less obe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dient ; and he would even experience pain because the </line>
         <line>modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do </line>
         <line>here; but when he gets over these things, he </line>
         <line>will find the advantage of the change. To say no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing of the difference of the Government, and the sat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>isfaction of chusing one's own rulers, there are many </line>
         <line>desirable things here. I estimate, as the greatest, </line>
         <line>the ease of providing for one's family. A man may, </line>
         <line>with very little exertion, leave to all his children </line>
         <line>land enough to make them independent. Hence that </line>
         <line>sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family </line>
         <line>is little known here."/&gt;</line>

         <line>tember 10, 1821. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; </line>
         <line>the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many </line>
         <line>born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. </line>
         <line>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never </line>
         <line>saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty </line>
         <line>and miserty than in any town of the size in the world.– </line>
         <line>There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being </line>
         <line>covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all A<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>merican towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of </line>
         <line>water in each : the town is capable of great improvement. </line>
         <line>The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as </line>
         <line>if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born </line>
         <line>race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of </line>
         <line>Peru we made the same observation; the ague very gene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ral, with fever–their habits and manner of living increase </line>
         <line>the evil: thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold </line>
         <line>–I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a </line>
         <line>thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the </line>
         <line>heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole </line>
         <line>not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living </line>
         <line>in a rational way. Very few families cook at home–they </line>
         <line>buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, </line>
         <line>and in the squares: not six families in Lima that have wine </line>
         <line>on their tables: they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse </line>
         <line>themselves for not having any thing that is expensive, by </line>
         <line>saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies him<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>self a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in </line>
         <line>the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, </line>
         <line>and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady </line>
         <line>take no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you </line>
         <line>she is quite as good as her neighbours, and needs be no bet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause </line>
         <line>of all the degradation of South America: every Viceroy, </line>
         <line>from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of </line>
         <line>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of </line>
         <line>this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it : </line>
         <line>scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle; </line>
         <line>few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin </line>
         <line>Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to </line>
         <line>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of </line>
         <line>Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>did. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the </line>
         <line>single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns : if this </line>
         <line>is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of </line>
         <line>produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true; </line>
         <line>but this requires tranquility and good government. Peo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ple in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; </line>
         <line>every traveller and historian who has written or talked a<sh/>

         <line>bout it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. </line>

            <small_caps>his Report</small_caps> only reached us yesterday ; but the So<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciety brings so much benevolence into activity, under the </line>
         <line>guidance of practical wisdom, aided by very enlightened </line>
         <line>views of the best interests of society, that we consider any </line>
         <line>delay improper in calling the attention of the public to </line>
         <line>their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds </line>
         <line>with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions. At home, not only are the laws improving, but the </line>
         <line>magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical </line>
         <line>departments. A great many jails, designed on much bet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ter principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the </line>
         <line>country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, <i>ge</i>
            <sh/>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>nerally</i>, that much more attentions is paid to health, clean<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>liness, diet, employment, and classification. It must not </line>
         <line>be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. </line>
         <line>There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, </line>
         <line>and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morn<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing ; others in which persons committed <i>for trial</i> are fet<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; </line>
         <line>and others in which debtors are exposed to the contami<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nating society of criminals, in which neither the various </line>
         <line>classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate </line>
         <line>from each other, and in which all are allowed to be idle. </line>
         <line>The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a <i>covered</i> vehicle </line>
         <line>for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the </line>
         <line>metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of </line>
         <line>inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely </line>
         <line>suspected of crime, by marching them <i>handcuffed</i> through the </line>
         <line>streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of <i>one hun-</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>dred prisoners</i> were marched for a mile <i>handcuffed</i>
         </line>
         <line>through the open streets, <i>in order to be formally set at liber-</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>ty by proclamation !</i> So much for metropolitan decorum ! </line>
         <line>These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however, </line>
         <line>long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, </line>
         <line>through the proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be </line>
         <line>enough to do them away ; but while they are continued </line>
         <line>England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The </line>
         <line>views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting </line>
         <line>notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Ne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>therlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Nor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>way, Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates </line>
         <line>have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In </line>
         <line>St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food, </line>
         <line>clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies' Asso<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciation, under the patronage of the Princess <small_caps>Mesthersky</small_caps>, </line>
         <line>is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an </line>
         <line>auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very frontiers of Sibe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ria. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; </line>
         <line>but their chains have been lightened, and their condition </line>
         <line>meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian </line>
         <line>Society. For details, however, we must refer to the Re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>port itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making </line>
         <line>special notice of the benefits conferred on society by </line>
         <line>the <i>Female Associations</i> and <i>Temporary Refuge</i>. The </line>
         <line>almost miraculous power of kindness, when accompanied, </line>
         <line>as genuine kindness often is, with quiet feeling and unob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' </line>
         <line>Committee, of which Mrs <small_caps>Fry</small_caps>, we believe, is still at the
            head. </line>
         <line>In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and licentiousness, have </line>
         <line>been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and the </line>
         <line>same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships </line>
         <line>in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. </line>
         <line>Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools </line>
         <line>for moral and religious instruction during the voyage, and </line>
         <line>the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing </line>
         <line>and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the </line>
         <line>manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their </line>
         <line>relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good </line>
         <line>works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the </line>
         <line>Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to </line>
         <column/>
         <line>observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have </line>
         <line>been established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, </line>
         <line>Derby, Dumfries, Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Notting<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ham, Plymouth, York, and <i>Glasgow</i>. We had once thought </line>
         <line>that, by this time, we might have added <i>Edinburgh</i> ; and </line>
         <line>we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vost will yet employ his influence in establishing a La<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dy's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– </line>
         <line>There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the hope, </line>
         <line>of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of </line>
         <line>the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distress<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed boys, who, on their discharge from the prisons of the </line>
         <line>metropolis, have expressed a desire to abandon their crimi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent </line>
         <line>want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih plea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sure on many who are variously settled, and <i>conducting them-</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>selves</i> exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are </line>
         <line>trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and </line>
         <line>religious duty, and after a time are provided with suitable </line>
         <line>situations." There is a great similarity in the histories of </line>
         <line>the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater </line>
         <line>number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been almost </line>
         <line>driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or </line>
         <line>destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had </line>
         <line>fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Commit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tee mention that on one recent occasion, no less than <i>eight</i>
         </line>
         <line>boys were released from Newgate in one day, and imme<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>diately after they had undergone the sentence of <i>flogging,</i>
         </line>
         <line>which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into ef<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus </line>
         <line>marked with the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and </line>
         <line>want of strength, they are disabled from working, at the </line>
         <line>very time they ought to go in search of employment. No </line>
         <line>more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these </line>
         <line>boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employ<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence </line>
         <line>their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to </line>
         <line>look upon what they call a <i>smart whipping</i> as the only corrective </line>
         <line>for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences </line>
         <line>to which their system inevitably tends. <i>We</i> are decidedly, </line>
         <line>and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, </line>
         <line>merely to be felt as such. In the case of children, if not </line>
         <line>
            <i>necessary</i> for that purpose, it will certainly give them the </line>
         <line>idea of power superior to their own, and may thus be the </line>
         <line>means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but </line>
         <line>
            <i>the law</i>, when it inflicts pain, has always other means of </line>
         <line>evincing its power, and constraining those who are within </line>
         <line>its grasp. Its most important function is to <i>prevent crime ;</i>
         </line>
         <line>its next is o convince those who comit offences that the </line>
         <line>means of detection are, on the whole, so sure that no<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>thing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next, to </line>
         <line>make restitution onerous and complete. There may also </line>
         <line>be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered </line>
         <line>and treated as <i>mad</i>–some are curable ; and some as incur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ably furious, who must either be cut off altogether, or </line>
         <line>confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction </line>
         <line>of punishments, because in our opinion the most effec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tual of those will be found to consist in the best means </line>
         <line>of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. </line>
         <line>All exposures, restraints, constraints, and compulsory re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>parations are punishments. We are only hostile to the inflic<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. </line>
         <line>If it can be made <i>obvious</i> to the sufferers that the pain inflicted </line>
         <line>
            <i>protects others</i>, or affords <i>true reparation</i> for the wrongs </line>
         <line>done to them or society, we shall then grant that such pu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison </line>
         <line>Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but </line>
         <line>firmly, from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind </line>
         <line>and irrational benevolence, and advocated measures which </line>
         <line>went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mon labourers, do still seem to us to have been too much </line>
         <line>moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a </line>
         <line>clever essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be </line>
         <line>somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour </line>
         <line>and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think </line>
         <line>them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they </line>
         <line>allow has been so worked or constructed at different places </line>
         <column/>
         <line>as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they </line>
         <line>very properly insist that every tread-mill should be pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vided with " a regulator," by which its rate of revolution </line>
         <line>may at all times be restrained within safe limits, and a </line>
         <line>dial-register, (lately invented by Mr <small_caps>Bate</small_caps>, instrument<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> maker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour </line>
         <line>may be, at any time, accurately ascertained, and which </line>
         <line>( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet in ascent </line>
         <line>for one day. There is an able argument in the report against </line>
         <line>compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned </line>

            <i>for trial</i> : and there is a great mass of curious and useful </line>

         <line>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a num<sh/>

         <line>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry </line>

         <line>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in </line>
         <line>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the </line>
         <line>expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first </line>

      <p>
         <line>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in </line>
         <line>Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of </line>
         <line>the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant, </line>

            <small_caps>Mr Secretary Peel</small_caps>, in moving the commitment of the Trans<sh/>

         <line>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire before the </line>
         <line>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last session </line>
         <line>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment </line>
         <line>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending </line>
         <line>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it </line>
         <line>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great </line>
         <line>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to whom, </line>
         <line>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South </line>
         <line>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection </line>
         <line>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment </line>
         <line>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– </line>
         <line>He gave this statement because it was right the public should </line>
         <line>know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment. </line>

         </line>
         <line>tionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger to </line>
         <line>me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did </line>
         <line>so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, </line>
         <line>
            <i>The South African Commercial Advertiser</i>, and said he was in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>structed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – </line>
         <line>that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and referred </line>
         <line>more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him </line>
         <line>to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then </line>
         <line>mentioned some <i>leading remarks</i>, which (he said) bore upon the </line>
         <line>Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as "<i>ob-</i>

         <line>
            <i>noxious,</i>" all quotations which had been made from " De Lolne[?],"/&gt;</line>

         <line>–" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and, as we </line>
         <line>are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his opi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also, that it was </line>
         <line>expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but wait </line>
         <line>until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts </line>
         <line>(such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to </line>
         <line>be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sure<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ties, in the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the </line>
         <line>offensive nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; </line>
         <line>and, lastly, that I was to take particular care, that the next num<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any </line>
         <line>notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would </line>
         <line>give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future </line>
         <line>number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be </line>

            <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> makes the following remarks on this </line>
         <line>case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>scription should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power </line>
         <line>produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best </line>
         <line>dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately </line>
         <line>quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments </line>
         <line>have this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in </line>
         <line>office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails </line>
         <line>itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere </line>
         <line>places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing </line>
         <line>can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a </line>
         <line>Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgrace<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies, every </line>
         <line>person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be asto<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial </line>
         <line>appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that </line>
         <line>is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal </line>
         <line>of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public </line>
         <line>what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe, that in a </line>
         <line>country of boundless extent, with only a settlement here and there, </line>
         <line>where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with, are </line>
         <line>the wild animals, it could possible enter in to the head of any ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game&gt; One </line>
         <line>would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation </line>
         <line>of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would do </line>
         <line>credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible </line>
         <line>disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the </line>
         <line>Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on </line>
         <line>this personage would be thrown away. </line>

            <i>Love in a Prison.</i>–We have all heard that "Love </line>
         <line>rules the court, the camp, the grove" but we have </line>
         <line>rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in </line>
         <line>prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity, nevertheless, </line>
         <line>that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in, at </line>
         <line>least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not </line>
         <line>long since a couple, who had imbided the tender pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and </line>
         <line>a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for </line>
         <line>by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken </line>

         <line>the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to </line>
         <line>marry before setting out for New South Wales. The </line>
         <line>fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same </line>
         <line>vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, </line>
         <line>for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omni<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>potent love–took the captives captive, and rendered </line>
         <line>them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, </line>

            <small_caps>House of Commons.–June 19.</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Speaker took the Chair at a few minutes before </line>
         <line>four o'clock, and was shortly afterwards summoned by </line>
         <line>the Deputy Usher of the Black Rod, to attend the </line>
         <line>House of Lords. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The <small_caps>Speaker</small_caps> stated, on his return, that the Royal </line>
         <line>Assent had been given by Commission to several public </line>
         <line>and private bills. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>C. Dundas</small_caps> presented a petition from Newbury, </line>
         <line>in the county of Berks, praying for the abolition of sla<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>very in the West Indies. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Planta</small_caps> moved for a new writ for the election of </line>
         <line>a member to serve in Parliament, in the room of Lord </line>
         <line>Leveson Gower, who had accepted the office of Chief<sh/>

            <small_caps>Ale-House Licensing Bill.</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the motion of Mr <small_caps>Estcourt</small_caps>, the house resolved </line>
         <line>itself into a committee on this bill. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the clause that no brewer who should himself sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ply public houses with beer, should be allowed to act or </line>
         <line>assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the </line>
         <line>granting of licenses, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Bernal</small_caps> moved that this clause be struck out </line>
         <line>altogether. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>R. Gordon</small_caps> supported the clause. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Monck</small_caps> thought this the most valuable clause </line>
         <line>in the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a sa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough </line>
         <line>magistrates. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mittee divided, when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– </line>
         <line>Majority against the clause 7. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then </line>
         <line>agreed to, amongst which was the omission of the </line>
         <line>words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of </line>
         <line>places from the operation of the bill. </line>
         <column/>
         <line>On the clause being proposed relative to the hours </line>
         <line>during which public houses should be kept open on </line>
         <line>Sundays. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Estcourt</small_caps> said, the original clause was to the </line>
         <line>effect that public-houses should be closed during the </line>
         <line>hours of morning and afternoon's divine service, but he </line>
         <line>thought it would be better not to permit publicans to </line>
         <line>allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after </line>
         <line>the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service </line>
         <line>(one o'clock.) </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>After a conversation, in which several hon. members </line>
         <line>participated, the clause was agreed to. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed </line>
         <line>to, the house resumed ; the report was brought up, or<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dered to be taken into further consideration on Monday </line>
         <line>next, and printed. </line>

            <small_caps>The Usury Laws.</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>P. Thompson</small_caps> moved the second reading of the </line>
         <line>usury laws amendment bill. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Davenport</small_caps> said he should oppose the bill, as </line>
         <line>he considered it to be highly injurious both to the land<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved </line>
         <line>an amendment, that the bill be read a second time that </line>
         <line>day three months. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The question on th amendment having been put, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The <small_caps>Chancellor</small_caps> of the <small_caps>Exchequer</small_caps>
            suggested </line>
         <line>the propriety of postponing this bill until the next ses<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion of parliament. He made this suggestion from no </line>
         <line>unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because </line>
         <line>this was not, he conceived, the most convenient time to </line>
         <line>consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered, </line>
         <line>with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>terfering with long-continued prejudices. If the dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cussion were postponed he would give the subject the </line>
         <line>best attention in his, (<i>hear</i>.) </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Heathcote</small_caps> approved of the suggestion of the </line>
         <line>right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the </line>
         <line>question to be postponed till the next session of parlia<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps> L. Foster</small_caps> thought that, between the total repeal, </line>
         <line>or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their </line>
         <line>present shape, a middle course might be steered. Of </line>
         <line>the bill before the house he thought that, under the </line>
         <line>guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the great<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>est illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try, for he was convinced that it would effect as com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as </line>
         <line>could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to </line>
         <line>consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all </line>
         <line>the great interest of the country. The bill might give </line>
         <line>relief to few, but would bring injury to many. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lord <small_caps>Palmerston</small_caps> thought the house indebted to </line>
         <line>the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It </line>
         <line>might be possible to form a bill better than that of the </line>
         <line>hon. member, but his bill was better than the present </line>
         <line>law, and as such he should vote for it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, </line>
         <line>when there appeared for the second reading,–Ayes, 52; </line>
         <line>Noes, 40 : majority in favour of the second reading, 12. </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lord <small_caps>Nugent</small_caps> moved the second reading of the </line>
         <line>voters' registration bill, and said that his object in car<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rying it through the present stage was, that the bill </line>
         <line>might be committed <i>pro forma,</i> for the purpose of hav<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing certain amendment introduced into it. It would </line>
         <line>then be printed with its amendments, in order that the </line>
         <line>house and the country might have the opportunity of </line>
         <line>considering its details between this and the next session </line>
         <line>of Parliament. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir <small_caps>R. Wilson</small_caps> moved, as an amendment, that the </line>
         <line>bill might be read a second time that day six months. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>H. Gurney</small_caps> seconded the amendment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The question was then put on the amendment, which </line>
         <line>was agreed to, and the bill was ordered to be read a se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cond time this day six months. </line>

         </line>
         <line>
            <small_caps>quer</small_caps>, the house resolved itself into a committee on the </line>
         <line>salmon fisheries preservation bill. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Ferguson</small_caps> proposed the insertion of a clause, </line>
         <line>exempting from the operation of the bill the salmon </line>
         <line>fisheries in the River and Bay of Thurso, in the county </line>
         <line>of Caithness, which are the exclusive property of Sir </line>
         <line>John Sinclair. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>After some conversation the gallery was cleared, and </line>
         <line>the committee divided, when the clause was lost. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The bill having passed through the committee, the </line>
         <line>report was ordered to be received this day. </line>

         <line>object of the Bill was of great importance, and he </line>
         <line>proposed, therefore, to have its provisions made </line>
         <line>generally known throughout the country, in order that </line>
         <line>it might be again presented to the house in as perfect a </line>
         <line>shape as possible. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to </line>
         <line>be printed. </line>

         <line>In the committee of supply, a number of grants of mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nor importance were agreed to. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir <small_caps>H. Hardinge</small_caps> said, he had another resolution to </line>
         <line>propose, but it was in which he expected that a re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duction would be made next year. It was, that a sum </line>
         <line>of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the </line>
         <line>disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Spring Rice</small_caps> said, that within the last twelve </line>
         <line>years there had been two millions and a half expended </line>
         <line>on this body, and that the subject was one which few </line>
         <line>gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say </line>
         <line>a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the </line>
         <line>staff, which was larger than that of England, was with<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>out a private man. Nothing could a more outra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>geous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment, and </line>
         <line>kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and </line>
         <line>friends. The militia might have been of service at one </line>
         <line>time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive police had been established, and quite superseded </line>
         <line>it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain </line>
         <line>if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if </line>
         <line>not abolish it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The <small_caps>Chancellor</small_caps> of the <small_caps>Exchequer</small_caps>
            begged to </line>
         <line>assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to </line>
         <line>make any economical reduction. When, however, a </line>
         <line>plan for the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was </line>
         <line>in contemplation, it would be laid before Parliament, </line>
         <line>and he should then be the friend of the definite and li<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mited powers to which he had alluded. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> said, the militia had been defended as </line>
         <line>though the country were in hourly danger of invasion </line>
         <column/>
         <line>–as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that </line>
         <line>were so, he would gladly learn of what use were the </line>
         <line>spies, who cost us L450,000 a-year. We had ambas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sadors–they were very little better than spies–at an </line>
         <line>expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>servance were not sufficient to save the country from </line>
         <line>sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir <small_caps>J. Mackintosh</small_caps> said, the object of his present </line>
         <line>motion, of which he had previously given notice, was, </line>
         <line>to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill </line>
         <line>which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had </line>
         <line>introduced–first, to the effect that the committee should </line>
         <line>recommend the introduction of a clause for the esta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and </line>
         <line>Van Diemen's Land; and secondly, that it should re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>commend that a clause be introduced, providing for the </line>
         <line>election of one-third of the Legislative Council from </line>
         <line>among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and </line>
         <line>having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] </line>
         <line>of three years. The best local authories in fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vour of his proposition. Among these he might men<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion the names of Governor Hunter, Governor Bligh, </line>
         <line>Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, </line>
         <line>and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone </line>
         <line>out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>to it of these institutions ; but, after two years careful </line>
         <line>investigation of the subject, wrote home in Oct. 1825, </line>
         <line>stating, that there was now no longer any doubt </line>
         <line>about its perfect ripeness for them.–(<i>Hear, hear.)–</i>
         </line>
         <line>The partial introduction of English institutions into </line>
         <line>immediate practise was the only pledge of a real inten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion on the part of government to introduce them more </line>
         <line>completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded </line>
         <line>by moving that instruction be given to the committee </line>
         <line>to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the </line>
         <line>colony, and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the le<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gislative councils. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> said, in the bill which he had intro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the </line>
         <line>government of the country of granting trial by jury </line>
         <line>in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find, if </line>
         <line>he examined, that the foundation would be laid of grant<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing </line>
         <line>their own concerns. At present the legislature propos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mittee for the purpose of watching and controuling </line>
         <line>every measure of the state. All trials should be public, </line>
         <line>under the inspection of a free press, and a population </line>
         <line>jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared </line>
         <line>in the course of a few years for the regular introduc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears </line>
         <line>when such a change should take place, that it would </line>
         <line>lead to any political convulsion. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> had every reason to believe, that if, in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would </line>
         <line>introduce a portion of representation and the privileges </line>
         <line>of British subjects into New South Wales, it would be </line>
         <line>the most flourishing of the colonies. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Horace Twiss</small_caps> said, the knowledge of one fact </line>
         <line>might obviate the necessity for one at least of the </line>
         <line>right hon. gent.'s propsitions, namely, that the gover<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nor of the colony had the power of extending to the co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonists the right of trial by jury if he should deem it ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pedient. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir <small_caps>James Mackintosh</small_caps> here intimated that he </line>
         <line>should not press his amendments. They were accord<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ingly negatived. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The house then resolved itself into the Committee </line>
         <line>when several verbal amendments were proposed and </line>
         <line>agreed to. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The bill then went through the committee, and the </line>
         <line>report, with the amendments, was ordered to be brought </line>
         <line>up on Monday. </line>
      </p>

      <p>
         <line>Sir J. <small_caps>Mackintosh</small_caps> presented a petition from Mr </line>
         <line>Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres </line>
         <line>were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the </line>
         <line>knowledge or leave of the writer, and without any pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron </line>
         <line>and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that </line>
         <line>every person who had given that subject consideration </line>
         <line>admitted that literary property was not sufficiently pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tected in this country, and that the decline of dramatic </line>
         <line>writing was to be attributed to the state of the law. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr G. <small_caps>Lamb</small_caps> thought it a very serious grievance that </line>
         <line>if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nager, and performed on the stage, and the writer </line>
         <line>brought to the miserable condition of a <i>damned</i> author </line>
         <line>
            <i>nolens volenns</i>. (<i>A laugh.</i>) The decline of dramatic </line>
         <line>writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unpro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fitable nature of that description of writing, as compar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed with other branches of literature ; and it would be </line>
         <line>very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his </line>
         <line>play like any other description of property, and that no </line>
         <line>manager should perform it without paying the writer, </line>
         <line>which was the system in France. </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Brougham</small_caps> rose to present a petition from a very </line>
         <line>respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous </line>
         <line>meeting of manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tants of Birmingham, and was signed by 8000 persons </line>
         <line>without solicitation. they contended that the distress </line>
         <line>which now prevailed, not only had reference to that </line>
         <line>poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole </line>
         <line>system of society. This distress the petitioners ascrib<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to the tampering that had taken place with the cur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid </line>
         <line>upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ; for, </line>
         <line>though it was true that a great number of failures had </line>
         <line>taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, </line>
         <line>that of about 70 bankers who had failed, as many as </line>
         <line>80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such </line>
         <line>were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion </line>
         <line>of the petitioners rather was, that the present distress </line>
         <line>arose from the speculations and over-trading which had </line>
         <line>taken place ; and that such might have been the case </line>
         <line>topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a </line>
         <line>great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from </line>
         <line>the depreciation of the currency, by which people were </line>
         <line>now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intend<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed when they were originally imposed, was extremely </line>
         <line>likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the </line>
         <line>petitioners described was another question. In the year </line>
         <line>1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>position of new taxes, because he thought that that was </line>
         <line>the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen </line>
         <line>for such an object. His opinion, however, had been </line>
         <line>over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That </line>
         <line>the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the </line>
         <line>country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was </line>
         <line>to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that </line>
         <line>after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing </line>
         <line>salaries, and dealing in the best possible way with all </line>
         <line>the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead </line>
         <line>Weight would still remain round the neck of the coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try, and press it down to the effectual injury of its best </line>
         <line>interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions </line>
         <line>of debt, and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually </line>
         <line>payable thereon? In the latter part of the petition he </line>
         <line>entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing would be </line>
         <column/>
         <line>done to give the people as great relief from the pressure </line>
         <line>of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to </line>
         <line>the public credit, and the service of the State ; and so </line>
         <line>far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he </line>
         <line>thought that the petitioners were wrong in their obser<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vations on the tampering of the currency, the more he </line>
         <line>was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which </line>
         <line>appeared to him to be founded on truth. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Bennett</small_caps> was of opinion that the forced resto<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ration of a metallic currency was one of the principal </line>
         <line>causes of the present distress. The taxes were now </line>
         <line>paid in money, and it now required twice the produce </line>
         <line>to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That </line>
         <line>was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be </line>
         <line>remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would </line>
         <line>never break faith with the public creditor, and the only </line>
         <line>means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an </line>
         <line>income tax. If the public debt were once removed, </line>
         <line>then free trade could take place in every branch of </line>
         <line>trade, but not till then. Such was the opinion of his </line>
         <line>late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner or later he thought </line>
         <line>some such measure would be resorted to. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Alderman <small_caps>Waitham</small_caps> observed that it was </line>
         <line>strange that while the public distress was admitted to </line>
         <line>be extreme, no effort was made to reduce the public ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>penditure. He was ready to prove that the export trade </line>
         <line>of the country had fallen off to the amount of from </line>
         <line>nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that </line>
         <line>in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. </line>
         <line>He did not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable </line>
         <line>but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at </line>
         <line>the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be </line>
         <line>shewn from Parliamentary documents. With respect </line>
         <line>to the petition now before the house, he mainly agreed </line>
         <line>with its statements, while at the same time he could </line>
         <line>never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with </line>
         <line>the public creditor. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>W. Whitmore</small_caps> heard with astonishment that </line>
         <line>our foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse </line>
         <line>being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was </line>
         <line>certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures, but so </line>
         <line>there was in the raw material, and the vast increase of </line>
         <line>machinery should also be taken into account. It was </line>
         <line>said that our exports had declined, but facts would </line>
         <line>prove decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799, the </line>
         <line>exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809, </line>
         <line>L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from </line>
         <line>1821 to 1826, L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and </line>
         <line>in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52,000,000– </line>
         <line>So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade, as </line>
         <line>stated by the worthy Alderman, (<i>hear, hear, hear.</i>) </line>
         <line>In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much, </line>
         <line>and he was induced to offer a word in order to counter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>act the danger which might arise if the statements of </line>
         <line>the worthy Alderman remained unanswered. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Sec. <small_caps>Peel</small_caps> observed, that, whenever any change, </line>
         <line>however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made </line>
         <line>in the system of our currency, it must be attended in </line>
         <line>the first instance with considerable inconveniences. </line>
         <line>The more he considered the subject, the more was he </line>
         <line>convinced that the best interests of the nation required </line>
         <line>that we should strictly adhere to the law of our cur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rency now established. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>) He hoped he </line>
         <line>should never see the time when the restrictions on cash </line>
         <line>payments should be renewed. When, however, the </line>
         <line>petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the </line>
         <line>amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would </line>
         <line>ask them what they would, in that case, do with the </line>
         <line>Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the gold would </line>
         <line>go out of the country. What would they do? They </line>
         <line>must renew the restriction on cash payments by the </line>
         <line>Bank. It was not any change in the value of the cur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had occa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the </line>
         <line>number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and </line>
         <line>they were assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in </line>
         <line>1823 they were 56, assessed at L18,293 ; in 1826, when </line>
         <line>the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72, asses<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small </line>
         <line>notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they </line>
         <line>were assessed at L25,245. The hon. gentleman oppo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>site had said that no fresh capital had been employed </line>
         <line>in this trade, but that persons would work at a loss ra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ther than let their machines stand idle. But if this </line>
         <line>were the case, it would not account for the erection of </line>
         <line>12 new factories, the establishment of which was irre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>concileable with the idea of general stagnation. With </line>
         <line>respect to the silk trade in Manchester, in 1823 there </line>
         <line>were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and </line>
         <line>there were between 3 and 4000 looms working ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had </line>
         <line>had a letter from Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon </line>
         <line>which he could rely, and it stated that all the silk weav<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ers were, or might be, in active emply. For the last </line>
         <line>ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in </line>
         <line>powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per an<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>num. Few persons had attributed enough to the im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number </line>
         <line>of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were </line>
         <line>out of emply than people could imagine, and the Ma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their </line>
         <line>parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the </line>
         <line>prosperity ot the places, they had a right to relief when </line>
         <line>in distress. Where the passage was so low, and this </line>
         <line>country possessed the advantage of a legal provision </line>
         <line>for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of </line>
         <line>Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important </line>
         <line>alterations in the state of the law. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>) He </line>
         <line>felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the </line>
         <line>values of the currency would be attended with the great<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>est evils to every class. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps> W. Horton</small_caps> observed, that some honourable </line>
         <line>gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and </line>
         <line>manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; </line>
         <line>but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to see how the redun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the </line>
         <line>change of the currency. Another class were the anti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>podes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn </line>
         <line>laws. But it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; </line>
         <line>we should look to practical remedies. As long as a re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dundancy of labour existed in England, which was ag<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked to </line>
         <line>England, and operated a still further prejudice to the </line>
         <line>labouring class of this country, the distress would con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tinue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he </line>
         <line>had pointed out was emigration, in the manner propos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed in the report of a committee of which he had the ho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum </line>
         <line>of money to locate pauper labourers in our North Ame<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rican colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read </line>
         <line>opinions in approbation of his plan, from Mr Tooke, </line>
         <line>Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observ<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to </line>
         <line>the same effect, in a lette which had been published. </line>
         <line>He then entered into a calculation, to show the saving </line>
         <line>to parishes by this plan, and he challenged any member </line>
         <line>of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– </line>
         <line>There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mediately." This was a delicate subject to touch </line>
         <line>upon, for he knew not how the vacuum could be fill<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed up but by the introduction of young gentlemen </line>
         <line>and ladies. (<i>A laugh</i>.) But was it supposed that </line>
         <line>fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty </line>
         <line>children? Or did these objectors suppose that labour<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The </line>
         <line>right honourable gentleman then adverted to the re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>marks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was stated that </line>
         <line>is appeared from the official documents that the mor<sh/>
         </line>
         <column/>
         <line>tality amongst the emigrants to North America had </line>
         <line>been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, where<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>as, in Wales, the proportion was 1 in 69, and in Eng<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land, 1 in 57. This, he would assert, was an incorrect </line>
         <line>statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in 14, </line>
         <line>it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed </line>
         <line>in Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>grants, it should be recollected, carried out children, </line>
         <line>and the mortality amongst children was in the propor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of 1 in 12, and in London much greater ; for it had </line>
         <line>been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the </line>
         <line>poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The </line>
         <line>right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last </line>
         <line>resolution–" That it is expedient that such measures </line>
         <line>should be adopted in the next Session of Parliament as </line>
         <line>may furnish the most safe and effectual means of pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ducing the desird improvement, by a judicious appli<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cation of both these principles, and at the same time </line>
         <line>under conditions which will prevent the probability of </line>
         <line>a recurrence of similar evils, and also effect a material </line>
         <line>saving of the national income, instead of producing an </line>
         <line>increased charge thereon."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> contended that colonization ought </line>
         <line>to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, </line>
         <line>this country could never have reached its present state </line>
         <line>of importance and prosperity, nor would our language </line>
         <line>have been extended to the United States, and been </line>
         <line>adopted in more distant countries. If there were one </line>
         <line>circumstance more striking than another, it was the pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>digious increase of consumption, a proof of the growing </line>
         <line>wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814, </line>
         <line>the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in </line>
         <line>our favour. This country would carry on its great affairs </line>
         <line>with as small a portion of metallic currency as possi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ble, but let them guard against a system which had led </line>
         <line>to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which </line>
         <line>was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a meta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>phor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it </line>
         <line>rose with splendour, but lost its brightness, and when </line>
         <line>its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness, like the </line>
         <line>shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had </line>
         <line>raised it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Secretary <small_caps>Peel</small_caps> said, in consequence of the </line>
         <line>course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to </line>
         <line>adopt in the previous Session, a series of unfounded ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lumnies had been levelled at him, which, however, he </line>
         <line>had despised too much to condescend to notice. But </line>
         <line>there was one which, as it reflected on his public and </line>
         <line>official character, he would, with permission of the </line>
         <line>house, allude to on that occasion. The report to which </line>
         <line>he alluded was, that he had used his influence as Secre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tary of State to procure an enormous grant of land </line>
         <line>for a relative of his. (<i>Hear, hear, hear.</i>) In conse<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quence of seeing this report in the public newspapers, </line>
         <line>he had requested his right honourable friend to move </line>
         <line>in that house, for the production of certain papers cal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culted to explain the whole matter. Those papers </line>
         <line>had in consequence been produced, and were now </line>
         <line>printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would </line>
         <line>excuse him for again alluding to the subject. (<i>Hear,</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>hear, hear.</i>) He hoped that the consequence of those </line>
         <line>papers being printed would have been, that some mem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber would have asked some questions on the subject ; </line>
         <line>but though this was not the case, he had received a </line>
         <line>communication which made him think that some one </line>
         <line>out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, </line>
         <line>though no member of that house had been so deceived, </line>
         <line>(<i>cheering</i>.) He begged in the first place, to state </line>
         <line>most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land </line>
         <line>for any brother of his, (<i>hear</i>) A gentleman, whose </line>
         <line>name was the same as his, and who was his second </line>
         <line>cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon. </line>
         <line>friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the </line>
         <line>house, upon his word of honour, as a gentleman, he had </line>
         <line>had no participation whatever, (<i>hear</i>.) With respect </line>
         <line>to the settlement on the Swan River, he was ashamed </line>

         <line>received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him </line>
         <line>that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South </line>
         <line>Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>forming him that government would be disposed to afford </line>
         <line>assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he </line>
         <line>and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in </line>
         <line>a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other </line>
         <line>calumnies which had been promulgated against him, </line>
         <line>they rather went to private matters, and he had there<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one </line>
         <line>had reference to the public department in which he of<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ficiated, he had thought it so far a public concern, as </line>
         <line>to venture to ask the attention of the house while he tres<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Otway Cave</small_caps> moved the following resolutions: </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any </line>
         <line>lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights </line>
         <line>of life and liberty, unless the owner shall himself com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"2d, That although neither the government nor the </line>
         <line>legislature of the county have arrogated to them<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>selves the power of destroying the natural rights </line>
         <line>of innocent British subjects, or of delegating any </line>
         <line>such power to other authorities, it is a notorious </line>
         <line>fact, that in many British Colonies lying remote </line>
         <line>from the immediate observation of the Government, </line>
         <line>innocent British born subjects are, from the time of </line>
         <line>their birth, robbed of their natural rights, and converted </line>
         <line>into slaves. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the </line>
         <line>Representatives of the people, to take effectual measures </line>
         <line>for protecting all British subjects that shall be born </line>
         <line>henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from simi<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>rights as human beings."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The motion being seconded by <small_caps>Mr Lumley,</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>W. Smith</small_caps> said, he could not give his support to </line>
         <line>these resolutions, because they were connected with a </line>
         <line>question of too much importance to be agitated in such </line>
         <line>a manner, and at such a period of the Session. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> was of opinion that resolutions of </line>
         <line>such a description as those brought forward by the hon. </line>
         <line>member, ought to be met by a direct negative. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The reso<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lutions were declared to be negatived without a division. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and </line>
         <line>the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock. </line>

         <line>has seldom, if ever, in his whole life, enjoyed better </line>
         <line>health than at the present moment. From the same </line>
         <line>quarter we have received a confirmation of what we </line>
         <line>mentioned some time back, that according to the present </line>
         <line>arrangements of the Court, it is certainly his Majesty's </line>

         <line>first month has been, not only will thre be no falling </line>
         <line>off at the close, but a considerable increase may confi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dently be anticipated. We understand that the general </line>
         <line>return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of </line>

         <line>sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She </line>
         <line>has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of </line>
         <line>whom are highly respectable, and many of them are in </line>

            <i>Gurney's Steam Carriage.</i>–Yesterday afternoon Mr </line>
         <line>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request </line>
         <line>of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack </line>
         <line>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies Percy, Dance, and </line>
         <line>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, </line>
         <line>and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. </line>
         <line>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had </line>
         <line>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the </line>
         <line>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 </line>
         <line>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on </line>
         <line>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew </line>
         <line>them round without the least diminuition of its speed, </line>
         <line>between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to </line>
         <line>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of </line>
         <line>the power and practicability of the invention. Having </line>
         <line>satisfied them as to this, and as to its manageability, </line>
         <line>by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them </line>
         <line>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times </line>
         <line>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is </line>
         <line>difficult to say whether the company was more pleased </line>
         <line>or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's </line>
         <line>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it </line>
         <line>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should </line>
         <line>derive from the introduction of such an invention as </line>
         <line>this. </line>

         <line>rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would </line>
         <line>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said, however, to </line>

         <line>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those </line>
         <line>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained </line>
         <line>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances </line>
         <line>of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions </line>
         <line>which he deemed insulting. </line>

            <i>The English Bench.</i>–There are two vacancies at </line>
         <line>present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the </line>
         <line>death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more </line>
         <line>recent decease of Mr Charles Warren, Chief Justice of </line>
         <line>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, </line>
         <line>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. </line>
         <line>Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mer ; and the choise, we supposem will be generally </line>
         <line>deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief </line>
         <line>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <i>Sun</i>, very </line>
         <line>properly recalls to public recollection the fact, that "the </line>
         <line>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended </line>
         <line>in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships </line>
         <line>altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fectly coincide, tht " the present seems a fair op<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portunity for carrying the recommendation into effect."/&gt;</line>
         <line>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one </line>
         <line>for reducing public expences, when public burdens are </line>
         <line>oppressive. </line>

            <i>Platina Coin.</i>–We have seen a specimen of the </line>
         <line>new Russian platina coinage. The coin is about the </line>
         <line>size of a shilling, but heavier than a sovereign, and of </line>
         <line>three roubles value. On one side are the Russian eagle </line>

            <i>Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.</i>–The spouses of the </line>
         <line>living British poets are well known to be among the plain<sh/>

         <line>through the whole catalogue, without discovering a </line>
         <line>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers </line>
         <line>in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is, that </line>
         <line>the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide </line>
         <line>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author </line>
         <line>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal </line>
         <line>of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to </line>
         <line>the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more </line>
         <line>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and di<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes </line>
         <line>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>scribe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not </line>
         <line>copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitch<sh/>

         <line>en fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– </line>
         <line>one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy </line>
         <line>mistresses as he can embody. </line>

            <i>Swan River.</i>–The ship Warrior, Stone, command<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>er, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, </line>
         <line>sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, </line>
         <line>with prospects of favourable weather in her progress </line>
         <line>down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of </line>
         <line>about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 </line>
         <line>passengers to the new settlement. Several of the pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sengers are persons of independent fortune, who have </line>
         <line>embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and </line>
         <line>and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the </line>
         <line>enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation </line>
         <line>the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six </line>
         <line>pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate </line>
         <line>number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians </line>
         <line>of course accompany the instruments to their destina<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the </line>
         <line>choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable </line>
         <line>number of swine, two milch cows, and three valuable </line>
         <line>horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be antici<sh/>

         <line>pated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, appre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>hensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo </line>
         <line>must be consigned to the ocean before the termination </line>
         <line>of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advan<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tageous arrangements entered into by the commander </line>
         <line>and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the </line>
         <line>Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enor<sh/>

            <small_caps>The King's Health.</small_caps>
         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavou<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rable accounts respecting his Majesty's health were cir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culating in London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday even<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing. In our last we alluded to the suspicions which </line>
         <line>the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after the </line>
         <line>first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>peared, certainly not of a character to remove the pub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lic anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' </line>
         <line>silence. Every one naturally puts the question, "If </line>
         <line>his Majesty is better, why not state this in a bulletin, </line>
         <line>that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation </line>
         <line>may be put to rest?" The <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
         </line>
         <line>says, that the high officers of State are not much </line>
         <line>better informed on the subject than others, and that </line>
         <line>a knowledge of his Majesty's real condition is </line>
         <line>confined to the very few immediately around his </line>
         <line>person. In the absence of correct information, infe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rences are drawn from every passing circumstance. It </line>
         <line>was observed that Sir Henry Halford very shortly after </line>
         <line>his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a </line>
         <line>long interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it </line>
         <line>has not escaped notice, that his Majesty's sister, the </line>
         <line>Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit him. </line>
         <line>The <i>Globe</i> says, that according to reports which are </line>
         <line>circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cites considerable alarm, and that gout in the </line>
         <line>stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms. </line>
         <line>What credit may be due to these statements, we </line>
         <line>cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, </line>
         <line>they furnish a reason for the publication of offi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cial intelligence. The King's health is a matter </line>
         <line>which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and </line>
         <line>deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We </line>
         <line>refer to our London head for a variety of articles upon </line>
         <line>the subject ; and if this night's mail bring any addi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tional information of importance we shall publish it </line>
         <line>in a secoond edition. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The two Houses of Parliament meet again on </line>
         <line>Monday. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We publish the address of the Birmingham Union </line>
         <line>to day, and meant to accompany it with some remarks, </line>
         <line>but have only time at present to express out regret </line>
         <line>that so masterly a paper, dealing in great and immu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>table principles, should have its value lessened by </line>
         <line>being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and </line>
         <line>with false or questionable doctrines respecting cur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rency. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not </line>
         <line>received any check. There are four ships now at Lon<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>don, and as many more at other ports, which are pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>paring to sail for the settlement with passengers. In<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>deed the numbers who are flying from the country at </line>
         <line>this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. </line>
         <line>Within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen </line>
         <line>ships that were loading with emigrants at Hull, twelve </line>
         <line>at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool, and </line>
         <column/>
         <line>Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, </line>
         <line>or British America. The exportation of human beings </line>
         <line>from the British Isles, to different quarters of the </line>
         <line>world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one or </line>
         <line>two thousand per week. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It will be remembered, that according to reports </line>
         <line>from India received some time ago, Lord William </line>
         <line>Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid </line>
         <line>human sacrifices, the <i>Suttees</i>. Doubts were thrown </line>
         <line>upon this intelligence when the subject was lately </line>
         <line>talked of in Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that </line>
         <line>its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official </line>
         <line>document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian Go<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vernment, that it has been hitherto either so callous, </line>
         <line>that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its </line>
         <line>own resources, and the true state of the people under </line>
         <line>its authority, as to believe that it had not power to </line>
         <line>effect its abolition. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The report of a revolution having taken place in </line>
         <line>Chili, is confirmed in letters from Bogota. The </line>
         <line>constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven out of </line>
         <line>the capital by General Prieto with an armed force, and </line>
         <line>great excesses are said to have been committed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, </line>
         <line>with 2000 soldiers on board. The expedition is sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed by some to be intended for the invasion of </line>
         <line>Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in </line>
         <line>keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– </line>
         <line>The plot to which we alluded in our last, seems to have </line>
         <line>excited much alarm. Some of the most opulent fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>milies in the island, with several lawyers and official </line>
         <line>persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we </line>
         <line>conjectured, to convert the island into an independent </line>
         <line>republic. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From a detailed list published in the French papers, </line>
         <line>it appears that the expedition against Algiers is to be </line>
         <line>composed of 34,000 men, infantry, cavalray, and artil<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lery. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Farther intelligence has been received from the ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pital of Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm </line>
         <line>address had been presented by the Congress to Bolivar, </line>
         <line>entreating him not to abandon the republic at a mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; </line>
         <line>and he seems to have once more consented to remain </line>
         <line>in office. Commissioners had been appointed to pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceed to Valentia, and endeavour to accomodate the </line>
         <line>differences between the people of Venezuela and the </line>
         <line>central government, by peaceable means. If these </line>
         <line>failed it was determined to employ force. The Congress </line>
         <line>was in session at Bogota, and was proceeding to fulfil the </line>
         <line>object for which it had been assembled, by drawing up </line>
         <line>a new constitution. The bases are published, and though </line>
         <line>the present only an imperfect sketch of its plan, </line>
         <line>they disclose one or two features which seem to be cha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>racteristic. The government is to be <i>central</i>, as it has </line>
         <line>hitherto been, not <i>federal</i> like that of the United States, </line>
         <line>which has served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, </line>
         <line>and La Plata. In the one case the supreme authority </line>
         <line>is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pital ; in the other it is divided among a number of </line>
         <line>local assemblies, while the general congress represent<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the whole, wields no other powers than what is ne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cessary to hold the separate members in a state of </line>
         <line>union. The federal system, which leaves to every pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vince the management of its own conerns, has ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but </line>
         <line>whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of </line>
         <line>an ignorant people newly escaped from political con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vulsions, is very questionable. There seems, how<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever, to be a partiality for the federal system in the </line>
         <line>new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stitution provides, that "Chambers of Distrcits" shall </line>
         <line>be established, with powers to decide on all municipal </line>
         <line>and local affairs. The difficulty will be, to give these </line>
         <line>bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry </line>
         <line>and resources of the country, without permitting them </line>
         <line>to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative functions, </line>
         <line>which will interfere with the business of the general </line>
         <line>government. Another articl state, that the members </line>
         <line>of the Senate and House of Representatives are to hold </line>
         <line>their seats for a considerable time, in order " to avoid </line>
         <line>the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or </line>
         <line>the repeated election of the same person." In the </line>
         <line>mouth of an English statesman, we should consider </line>
         <line>this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made </line>

         <line>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The <i>Examiner</i> of Sa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>turday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which </line>
         <line>appeared in our paper on the excess of females over </line>
         <line>males in the census, which he assures us is entirely </line>
         <line>owing to the lives of females being prolonged by their </line>
         <line>better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the ha<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom </line>
         <line>we were supposed by implication to be cut off perma<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty </line>
         <line>fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the </line>
         <line>number bears any proportion to the amount supposed; </line>
         <line>we have two other remarks to make on his state<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. First, since our manners were corrupted by im<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>itating <i>English</i> fashions, it is whispered, we hope un<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>, that there are such things as tippling women in </line>
         <line>country, some of whom do disappear suddenly–no </line>
         <line>matter how; and secondly, we wish our London friend </line>
         <line>inform us how it happens, that while all Broad </line>
         <line>England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females, </line>
         <line>Edinburgh should have no less than 24! We under<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stand that since this astounding fact was brought out, </line>
         <line>there has been a great efflux of ladies from the city to </line>
         <line>the adjoining counties. We know a number who have </line>
         <line>or are flying to Fife and the north. A friend, who </line>
         <line>careful observer, compares it to the dispersion of </line>

         <line>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose </line>
         <line>reformation is hopeless, and whom it is therefore desir<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>able to remove from the Society to whose peace and se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>curity they are sworn enemies. This is the sole value </line>
         <line>of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be </line>
         <line>had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the </line>
         <line>gibbet. Experience shews, however, that transportation </line>
         <line>does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the </line>
         <line>guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the </line>
         <line>situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers </line>
         <line>with families dread it extremely, while to single men, </line>
         <line>mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages, and </line>
         <line>generally to all those who feel a desire of change, and a </line>
         <line>vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears </line>
         <line>to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there </line>
         <line>is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct </line>
         <line>servants, and those who get them, endeavour, from </line>
         <line>a regard to their own interest to render the situation </line>
         <line>of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The </line>
         <line>evidence proves, that when the feeling degrada<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion is once overcome, the situation of the Australian </line>
         <line>convict "is, in many respects, preferable to that of </line>
         <line>the agricultural labourer in this country :" He </line>
         <line>has better clothing, more abundant food, and en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>joys a finer climate. The hardship, too, of compulsory </line>
         <line>labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is </line>
         <line>transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, </line>
         <line>at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this </line>
         <line>ticket he is allowed to work on his own account, and </line>
         <line>with high wages, easily acquires capital. The com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mittee see little chance of rendering punishment effec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive in the colony. They recommend various subordi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a </line>
         <line>remedy for the great expense attending transportation, </line>
         <line>that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall </line>
         <line>have paid, or given security for the payment by instal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of </line>
         <line>the convict from the mother country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase </line>
         <line>of crime is to be found, first, in the diffusion of educa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion and sound knowledge ; and, second, in the improve<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of our judicial and municipal institutions. Law, </line>
         <line>in all its important branches, should be dispensed by </line>
         <line>paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to </line>
         <line>be stationed in each small district, and keep open </line>
         <line>court every day of the year. He should be chosen </line>
         <line>by some popular constituency, which would faithfully </line>
         <line>represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and </line>
         <line>as a guarantee for his diligence, he should hold his </line>
         <line>office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Jus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected </line>
         <line>as in most of the American states, by the householders </line>
         <line>for three, four, or seven years. Jails also, should be </line>
         <line>placed under the controul of popular bodies, and thrown </line>
         <line>open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. </line>
         <line>In this, as in other points, we have much to learn from </line>
         <line>the Americans, who never forget that the criminal is still </line>
         <line>a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been, </line>
         <line>that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose situation </line>
         <line>they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feel<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no </line>
         <line>sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a bar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>barism belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years </line>
         <line>hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated </line>
         <line>so monstrous a system. </line>

         <line>of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest </line>

         <line>have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 </line>

            <i>The Wool Trade.</i>–The whole of the London public </line>
         <line>sales of Colonial and other woold having now been </line>
         <line>gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, </line>
         <line>and transactions by private contract are conducted on a </line>
         <line>more extensive scale. The total amount of the late </line>
         <line>sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was </line>
         <line>4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the </line>
         <line>manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the </line>
         <line>previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quota<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. </line>
         <line>The sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>creased boldness was observed. The colonial wools </line>
         <line>offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few </line>
         <line>bales were also offered, forming a part of the second </line>
         <line>clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. </line>
         <line>They were much better in quality than those last re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceived. Some German lambs' wool also commanded </line>
         <line>attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The </line>
         <line>sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite </line>
         <line>so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according </line>
         <line>to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted </line>
         <line>of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's </line>
         <line>Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and </line>
         <line>72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. </line>
         <line>The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to </line>
         <line>3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the </line>
         <line>best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d </line>
         <line>to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van </line>
         <line>Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German </line>
         <line>2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to esta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions </line>
         <line>than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are </line>
         <line>limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, </line>
         <line>and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tered at the custom house. </line>

            <enlarged_capital>T</enlarged_capital>he subject of emigration is rising in importance </line>
         <line>from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long </line>
         <line>as much misery or much discontent exists among our </line>
         <line>working classes. Upper Canada, the great recipient of </line>
         <line>our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a </line>
         <line>distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such </line>
         <line>is the amazing economy of water carriage, when se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>conded by good arrangements, that the voyage by sea </line>
         <line>to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the </line>
         <line>journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money </line>
         <line>from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) </line>
         <line>has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher </line>
         <line>probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants </line>
         <line>were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what </line>
         <line>was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment </line>
         <line>aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is </line>
         <line>got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified for the </line>
         <line>detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, </line>
         <line>with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a </line>
         <line>man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing can be conveyed over a distance equal to one-sixth </line>
         <line>part of the circumference of the globe, and six times </line>
         <line>longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at </line>
         <line>the small coast of 45s ! </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid </line>
         <line>strides with which emigration was advancing ; and </line>
         <line>some Parliamentary papers we have received since, ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>hibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It </line>
         <line>has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most </line>
         <line>sanguine. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The following table shows the number of person who </line>
         <line>have emigrated in the last eight years to North America, </line>
         <line>the Cape, and Australia :– </line>

         <line>British America. United States. Cape of G. Hope. Australia. Total. </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It will be seen from this table how steady the in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>crease of emigration has been, especially to Canada. </line>
         <line>It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably </line>
         <line>more than a half of those who sailed for the United </line>
         <line>States, were destined for the British colonies, and only </line>
         <line>chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the </line>
         <line>facilities which the Hudson and its associated canals </line>
         <line>present for travelling to the upper province. Canada </line>
         <line>and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that </line>
         <line>the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; </line>
         <line>and from the previous arrangements made, it is an<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nounced that a much larger number of persons could </line>
         <line>have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine </line>
         <line>as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that </line>
         <line>emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with </line>
         <line>the extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>emplified. Those who reflect on the distress and </line>
         <line>perplexity which would be produced by land<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the <i>sixth-part</i> of eighty thousand strangers on </line>
         <line>the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate </line>
         <line>the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, </line>
         <line>with less than a million inhabitants, can take in </line>
         <line>eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without </line>
         <line>embarassment or confusion. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 </line>
         <line>souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number </line>
         <line>sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who </line>
         <line>made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of </line>
         <line>emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any </line>
         <line>part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to </line>
         <line>see still greater things atcheived. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It appears from the various census since 1801, that </line>
         <line>the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, </line>
         <line>would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in </line>
         <line>a more striking light by stating, that <i>there are about a</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>day than there was on the day before</i>. If by raising </line>
         <line>the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could </line>
         <line>get this daily increase reduced one half, and the </line>
         <line>other half could be carried off by emigration–if we </line>
         <line>could by this means keep the supply of labour station<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ary while capital was increasing, a great improvement </line>
         <line>would be effected in the state of the population. Now </line>
         <line>from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants </line>
         <line>who leave our shores annually amount to nearly one<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> third of the annual excess already ; and in a year or </line>
         <line>two there is every probability that it will amount to </line>
         <line>one-half. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and </line>
         <line>Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, </line>
         <line>28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In </line>
         <line>the year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, </line>

         <line>15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London </line>
         <line>2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and </line>

         <line>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, </line>
         <line>states in his Report, that "the general description of </line>
         <line>emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy fa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>milies came from all part of the united kingdom ; and </line>
         <line>the extent of property and specie brought into the </line>
         <line>country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting </line>
         <line>to from &#x163;600,000 to &#x163;700,000 sterling." About 5000 </line>
         <line>persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes </line>
         <line>or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of </line>
         <line>irregular habits, and ill fitted for the situation of set<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The </line>
         <line>fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. </line>
         <line>It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the </line>
         <line>persons who arrived after that, suffered much from </line>
         <line>the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; </line>
         <line>but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>grants who fell victims to the disease, at no more than </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The demand for all classes of working people </line>
         <line>(says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Ca<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, </line>
         <line>and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late </line>
         <line>tour through the districts and settlements of Upper </line>
         <line>Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who </line>
         <line>could not meet with emplyment. The number of </line>
         <line>that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply </line>
         <line>the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. </line>
         <line>This was particularly felt in the Western and London </line>
         <line>districts of the upper province, where the want of la<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bourers was so great that it was found necessary to en<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>courage a number to come over from Ohio and Pen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, </line>
         <line>and the arrival of emigrants closed in October. </line>

         <line>Downing street, April 6, 1834. </line>
         <line>Numerous applicants have been received from per<sh/>

         <line>for that purpose, on condition of repaying the same out </line>
         <line>of their earnings in the colony where they propose to </line>
         <line>settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the </line>
         <line>appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial reve<sh/>

         <line>to become useful settlers. The following are the re<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding </line>

         <line>or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided </line>

         <line>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Asso<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciation was held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pose of explaining the principles, objects, plan, and prospects </line>
         <line>of a new colony," proposed to be founded in South Australia. </line>
         <line>Mr W. Whitmore in the chair. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first </line>
         <line>question which the meeting would have to consider would be </line>
         <line>this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity </line>
         <line>for a more extended system of colonization. It appeared to </line>
         <line>him that there was a great defect in our present system of </line>
         <line>colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if </line>
         <line>we established it upon a new principle, well and seriously </line>
         <line>considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect </line>
         <line>was, that we did not provided that colonization which in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cluded within it members of all classes of society. Large </line>
         <line>numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carry<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing with them that number of the lower class which was </line>
         <line>necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other </line>
         <line>cases, perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out </line>
         <line>without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ </line>
         <line>his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now </line>
         <line>the question which they were then called upon to consider, </line>
         <line>regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those </line>
         <line>means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might </line>
         <line>be accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a sys<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tem that all the waste lands which they were about to colo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nize should be sold at a given price, such as the market would </line>
         <line>command, and that the proceeds of such sales should be </line>
         <line>employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number </line>
         <line>of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system </line>
         <line>could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the evils </line>
         <line>of our present system of colonization would be removed, and </line>
         <line>that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>munity of the mother country with all its various grades into </line>
         <line>the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He </line>
         <line>believed that if we proceeded upon this principle, we should </line>
         <line>lay the foundation of the greatest colony which England had </line>
         <line>ever settled. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the </line>
         <line>wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>moted by the establishment of British colonies in various </line>
         <line>parts of the world, and that colonization, when conducted </line>
         <line>systematically and upon sound principles, offers the means of </line>
         <line>extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united </line>
         <line>kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and </line>
         <line>labour." He would not enter into the recommendations </line>
         <line>which this undertaking offered to all classes of the communi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ty ; but he would venture to state, that to any gentleman </line>
         <line>who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the </line>
         <line>association, and who recollected that it was a matter of cer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means </line>
         <line>of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was </line>
         <line>superabundant here, it must be evident that from this impor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tant innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be </line>
         <line>derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at </line>
         <line>great length into the difficulty of finding employment, which </line>
         <line>now prevails in all parts of the community, and then, after </line>
         <line>condemning the corn laws, continued thus–Colonization, if </line>
         <line>carried on to a considerable extent, would as effectually add </line>
         <line>millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were </line>
         <line>filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it </line>
         <line>not clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that </line>
         <line>the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres </line>
         <line>would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of </line>
         <line>the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] </line>
         <line>for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and that the diffi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>culties flowing from an unemployed population would cease ? </line>
         <line>Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of </line>
         <line>our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. </line>
         <line>(Hear.) Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were </line>
         <line>added to our own island, because, if this plan of colonization </line>
         <line>be adopted, a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers, </line>
         <line>now wanting employment, from this country, for its culture, </line>
         <line>will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation of </line>
         <line>the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins </line>
         <line>these distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)– </line>
         <line>There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code, and </line>
         <line>the removal of restrictions on labour, would greatly facilitate, </line>
         <line>extend, and increase the commercial intercourse between the </line>
         <line>old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase </line>
         <line>be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the </line>
         <line>consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in </line>
         <line>other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it </line>
         <line>is virtually an extension of the mother country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– </line>
         <line>"That in establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken </line>
         <line>to combine labour and capital with land, in such propor<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all </line>
         <line>classes of society, and that, in establishing modern colonies, </line>
         <line>this important consideration has been so generally overlook<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to state that </line>
         <line>in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought </line>
         <line>to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had </line>
         <line>led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place, </line>
         <line>the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. </line>
         <line>No individual was to obtain a single acre by gift. There was </line>
         <line>to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on a footing of </line>
         <line>equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for </line>
         <line>nothing. There would also be another advantage in this sys<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tem, which would arise in the following :–In other co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could </line>
         <line>get land for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that </line>
         <line>land was wealth, instead of it being merely the means of </line>
         <line>producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to </line>
         <line>refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out, </line>
         <line>and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had </line>
         <line>in consequence set up, where he was far away from the mar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ket of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey </line>
         <line>his produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in </line>
         <line>this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time </line>
         <line>to work for hire. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following </line>
         <line>effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of </line>
         <line>a new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any </line>
         <line>exception, shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to </line>
         <line>individuals by sale only, and according to an uniform, impar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tial, and permanent system."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the </line>
         <line>highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. </line>
         <line>Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the </line>
         <line>recovery of their health, and had found something so tem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perate and soothing in the country, that they had retired </line>
         <line>there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the </line>
         <line>chills of their native country, England. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that </line>
         <line>the whole of the purchase money of public land, without any </line>
         <line>deduction, should be employed in providing a free passage </line>
         <line>from the mother country to the colony, of young adult per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons of the labouring class, who may be willing to emigrate, </line>
         <line>and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of </line>
         <line>labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the </line>
         <line>more labour they imported, the greater labour did they give </line>
         <line>their land ; the more they got for the sale of it, the greater </line>
         <line>was their power of importing fresh labour. This resolution, </line>
         <line>therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself, and when </line>
         <line>it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed on<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity, </line>
         <line>meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of </line>
         <line>England to part with her inhabitants. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied por<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions of the earth which form part of the British dominions, </line>
         <line>the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly </line>
         <line>suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied </line>
         <line>in the preceding resolutions." The place where this colony</line>
         <line>was to be founded was one distinguished from every other </line>
         <line>part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal </line>
         <line>communications prior even to the formation of roads, and </line>
         <line>the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its culti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vation. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of </line>
         <line>this colony abounded with whales, and that its whale fishe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ries might become valuable. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the </line>
         <line>mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. </line>
         <line>No colony could go on without some law. He did not care </line>
         <line>how little they had of it, provided they made up in quality </line>
         <line>what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered </line>
         <line>into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enact<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed for the colony, and concluded by moving–"That the </line>
         <line>provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the </line>
         <line>British Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill </line>
         <line>now before Parliament, are highly satisfactory."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., </line>
         <line>seconded the following resolution :–"That it is the opinion </line>
         <line>of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr </line>
         <line>Spring Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>moting the beneficial public object of the South Australian </line>
         <line>Association."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were </line>
         <line>given to the Chairman, and the meeting, at which many </line>
         <line>ladies were present, broke up. The proceedings lasted from </line>
         <line>twelve o'clock to a quarter before five. </line>

         <line>and obtained a rule to show cause why, under the act of Par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>liament, a <i>mandamus</i> should not issue to compel the Court </line>
         <line>of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>troul. On the 31st of January, 1834, the Court of King's </line>
         <line>bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application </line>
         <line>for the <i>mandamus</i>, when, without any reason being assigned, </line>
         <line>the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew </line>
         <line>his application. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>C. Grant</small_caps> said that in the regret which had been
            express<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities, </line>
         <line>he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he </line>
         <line>confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. </line>
         <line>Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. </line>
         <line>The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give </line>
         <line>a brief outline of the case, and referred to the various high </line>
         <line>authorities connected with India, who had declared in favour </line>
         <line>of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plication for the <i>mandamus</i> without explanation, he had to </line>
         <line>say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors, </line>
         <line>he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did </line>
         <line>not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the </line>
         <line>recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the </line>
         <line>claim upon his attention. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Sir <small_caps>R. Peel</small_caps> said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and in
            the </line>
         <line>present state of the world most inconvenient, that the non<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>payment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of </line>
         <line>England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cept where sanctioned by positive treaty. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> contended, that on the whole, the debt was a just </line>
         <line>one, and ought to be paid. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The subject here dropped. </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the question that this bill be read a third time, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr T. <small_caps>Gladstone</small_caps> rose to oppose it. It would, he said, be </line>
         <line>useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inopera<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if pass<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected </line>
         <line>to its principle, the admission of which was equally destruc<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. </line>
         <line>Further, they were bound to respect corporate rights as long </line>
         <line>as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one </line>
         <line>could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of </line>
         <line>their founders." (Hear, hear.) </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr V. <small_caps>Smith</small_caps> supported the bill, as one calculated to take </line>
         <line>away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a </line>
         <line>compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science </line>
         <line>and literature. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Baines</small_caps> said, that the original statutes showed that there </line>
         <line>were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the </line>
         <line>time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had </line>
         <line>in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learn<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing, which were meant to be universal, both as to the sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>jects taught, and the persons to whom they were communi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cated. In this sense, the term was understood and applied in </line>
         <line>other countries, and it was an extraordinary fact, deserving </line>
         <line>of attention, that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge </line>
         <line>were the only universities that were closed to a large pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portion of the upper classes of the people in any country in </line>
         <line>Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous </line>
         <line>indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should </line>
         <line>attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the </line>
         <line>best seats of literature and science. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr H. <small_caps>Hughes</small_caps> could not accede to the measure, and there<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fore moved that it be read that day six months. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>Goulburn</small_caps> contended that the introduction of the Dis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>senters, as proposed under the present bill, would be nothing </line>
         <line>short of the destruction of the present system of education at </line>
         <line>the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ligion could only be taught according to some set form : </line>
         <line>abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion </line>
         <line>itself. (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was </line>
         <line>perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those es<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tablishments would be completely defeated : he therefore de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>precated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to </line>
         <line>the best interest of the country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Lord <small_caps>Palmerstone</small_caps>, Sir R. <small_caps>Inglis</small_caps>,
            and Mr G. <small_caps>Wood</small_caps> then </line>
         <line>addressed the house, but amidst such discordant noises as </line>
         <line>prevented what they said being heard. The laughing, jeer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing, shouting, were such as has seldom been heard. In par<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ticular two hon. members who entered from the smoking </line>
         <line>room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr </line>
         <line>Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the </line>
         <line>seats secure from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a </line>
         <line>row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker, with </line>
         <line>much indignation in his tone and manner, called the parties </line>
         <line>to order. </line>
      </p>

      <p>
         <line>Mr S. <small_caps>Rice</small_caps> moved the order of the day for the house </line>
         <line>to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization </line>
         <line>of Southern Australia, </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr A.<small_caps>Baring</small_caps> rose and stated various objections to the
            pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ject. The hon. member contended that at this period of the </line>
         <line>year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important </line>
         <line>subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he </line>
         <line>said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction </line>
         <line>any such experiment without a full conviction that there was </line>
         <line>a reasonable probability of its success. In his opinion the </line>
         <line>experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any </line>
         <line>similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to </line>
         <line>the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied </line>
         <line>up by mortgages in such a way, that it would not again re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vert to the Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The </line>
         <line>result would be, that if the gentlemen who set the project on </line>
         <line>foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would </line>
         <line>be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia, </line>
         <line>unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted. </line>
         <line>While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious </line>
         <line>not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for </line>
         <line>he was very favourable to it. Every new opening to co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the </line>
         <line>poorer classes, (Hear, hear, hear.) It was not, therefore, </line>
         <line>to the principle of colonization that he was opposed, </line>
         <line>but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most </line>
         <line>mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large </line>
         <line>portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the </line>
         <line>extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment. Let </line>
         <line>the gentlemen take, if they like, 100 square miles, but let </line>
         <line>them not risk the whole of a great continent. People, like </line>
         <line>fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might </line>
         <line>get a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the </line>
         <line>tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of </line>
         <line>the project. The hon. member then objected to two of the </line>
         <line>principles which were laid down by the projectors, that land </line>
         <line>should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that no credit </line>
         <line>should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted </line>
         <line>with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, </line>
         <line>would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who </line>
         <line>went out to Australia would think of taking less than two </line>
         <line>hundred acres. Now that would cost him &#x163;120; it would </line>
         <line>cost him &#x163;120 more to get himself and his family over; which, </line>
         <line>with stock and other expenses, would amount to &#x163;500 or &#x163;600. </line>
         <line>He would, therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ther they thought any man who had &#x163;500 or &#x163;600 in this </line>
         <line>country, would go out and set himself down on two hundred </line>
         <line>acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore suggested to </line>
         <line>his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be post<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>poned until another session, and then have it referred to a </line>
         <line>select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amend<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment, that the bill be committed on that day six months. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr W. <small_caps>Whitmore</small_caps> was thakful for the very candid manner </line>
         <line>in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. </line>
         <line>With respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) </line>
         <line>thought that was necessary, as it was intended to introduce a </line>
         <line>completely new system of colonization–one very different from </line>
         <line>any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was </line>
         <line>intended to take under this act was from 500,000 to 600,000 </line>
         <line>square miles, and it was the leading principle of the bill that </line>
         <line>all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied </line>
         <line>to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.– </line>
         <line>(Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a </line>
         <line>constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the </line>
         <line>Canada Company had been at a higher price. He had san<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>guine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to </line>
         <line>borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sidered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the </line>
         <line>country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and </line>
         <line>amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, </line>
         <line>and therefore he hoped it would pass. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr <small_caps>O'Dwyer</small_caps> contended that, before the house thought of </line>
         <line>agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something </line>
         <line>towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of </line>
         <line>Ireland. The various reports which committees of that house </line>
         <line>had made, showed that one-fourth of the land of that country </line>
         <line>was untilled, but was at the same time what was called re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>claimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation and </line>
         <line>produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the sur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the culti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from Ire<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give </line>
         <line>them that and the house would hear no more about murders, </line>
         <line>fires, and other outrages. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr S. <small_caps>Rice</small_caps> in reference to the allusion made by the hon. </line>
         <line>and learned member, begged to say that, although much of </line>
         <line>the bog land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a </line>
         <line>portion of it was the property of the Government, who had </line>
         <line>been, and still were, making experiments, with a view to as<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>certain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into </line>
         <line>effect. With respect to the manner in which the hon. mem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber for Essex had opened this question, he must confess that </line>
         <line>he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ence, and of such a character, too, as could not fail to carry </line>
         <line>weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak </line>
         <line>in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to </line>
         <line>withdraw, and the house divided, when there appeared–For </line>
         <line>going into committee, 72; against it 7–Majority, 65. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The bill went through the committee. The report was re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ceived, and ordered to be taken into further consideration on </line>
         <line>Thursday next. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the </line>
         <line>Speaker left the chair. </line>

         <line>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the </line>

         <line>Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on land<sh/>

         <line>fort and security from improper intrusion. The </line>

         <line>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed </line>
         <line>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee </line>
         <line>that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the </line>
         <line>young women were engaged, and went into comfort<sh/>

         <line>able situations, on the first and second days after land<sh/>

         <line>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female </line>
         <line>servants in demand throughout the colony. The </line>
         <line>wages varied from &#x163;8 to &#x163;20. Some, who were not </line>

         <line>respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to </line>
         <line>this class are small, say &#x163;25 to &#x163;40. Nursery gover<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>In considering cases the present practise of the Go<sh/>

         <line>beyond that of any former period of equal duration. </line>

         <line>tion and astonishment at the versatility and power of </line>

         <line>the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an </line>
         <line>elder there. Against his election to serve in the As<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, </line>
         <line>as we understand, that he has no domicile within the </line>
         <line>bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; </line>
         <line>the protesters allowing that his election, though con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an </line>
         <line>act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is </line>
         <line>sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the </line>

         <line>also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that </line>

         <line>honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has </line>
         <line>done so much for the cause of literature and religion, </line>
         <line>the members of the College have done an act which </line>
         <line>shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which </line>
         <line>will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious pub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lic of Scotland. Those who have had the good for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor </line>
         <line>Paxton, and even the general church-going commu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nity, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, </line>
         <line>of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical </line>
         <line>elegance which have long characterised his public </line>
         <line>preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which </line>
         <line>he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the </line>
         <line>most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In </line>
         <line>his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General </line>
         <line>Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate </line>
         <line>Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and </line>
         <line>profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an </line>
         <line>unwearied research into the Natural History, and the </line>
         <line>manners and usages of the ancients nations. The </line>
         <line>work by which he is chiefly known as an author– </line>
         <line>
            <i>The Illustrations of Scripture</i>–will long bear testi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mony to the extent of his learning, and of his Orien<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tal investigations, and to his powers of lucid and elo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quent composition. We understand that the attention </line>
         <line>of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by </line>
         <line>the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. </line>
         <line>This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the </line>
         <line>same field of study, reflects high honour on the dis<sh/>

         <line>whom the present meeting had assembled to do ho<sh/>
         </line>

         </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly managed; and we are glad to find that such a man </line>
         <line>as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Die<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system is </line>
         <line>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only </line>
         <line>are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human </line>
         <line>nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the manage<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of the heterogenous materials of our penal colo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes </line>
         <line>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our </line>
         <line>rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending </line>
         <line>our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust </line>
         <line>an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts </line>
         <line>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the public acquainted with the mode in which </line>
         <line>the business is conducted, in the hope that some hu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject </line>
         <line>up. The mode of managing female emigration is </line>
         <line>this :– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a </line>
         <line>free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this </line>
         <line>ship must ave a <i>full</i> cargo, to satisfy the <i>owners.</i>
         </line>
         <line>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> makers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better </line>
         <line>articles, is made up. But if, as almost always hap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship </line>
         <line>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings </line>
         <line>is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a </line>
         <line>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount </line>
         <line>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough </line>
         <line>of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the </line>
         <line>poor creatures they are crammed <small_caps>four into one</small_caps>
         </line>
         <line>
            <small_caps>bed</small_caps> ! </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to </line>
         <line>know the fact, that some young women of respectabi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lity who wished to go to New South Wales <i>with their</i>
         </line>
         <line>
            <i>friends</i>, were refused a free passage, unless they went </line>
         <line>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we </line>
         <line>see that the interests of agents and shipowners over<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>comes the interests of the colonies, and actually ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>structs the attainment of the object in view. We find </line>
         <line>blindness a very common ailment in every department </line>
         <line>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may </line>
         <line>be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful mea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which </line>
         <line>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, </line>
         <line>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean </line>
         <line>the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the </line>
         <line>inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all pa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption </line>
         <line>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to </line>
         <line>support those who are willing to apply it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>As in a matter of so much importance nothing </line>
         <line>should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating </line>
         <line>that it consists with our knowledge that, after the </line>
         <line>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing the deplorable consequences of sending out young </line>
         <line>women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, </line>
         <line>nearly filled up as we have described. When any </line>
         <line>representation is made to a public office, the matter is </line>
         <line>said to belong to another department ; and that other </line>
         <line>department says it is not its province to interfere ; and </line>
         <line>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battle<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the </line>
         <line>inhuman job will be put an end to. </line>

            <small_caps>Mr Walter</small_caps> moved, pursuant to notice, that "an hum<sh/>

         <line>veral postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed </line>
         <line>to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and </line>
         <line>to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities </line>
         <line>be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen </line>
         <line>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the </line>
         <line>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had </line>
         <line>been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as </line>
         <line>obtained services found themselves placed among a very dif<sh/>

         <line>ferent calss of persons to that which they had been accustom<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an </line>
         <line>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February </line>
         <line>last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus </line>
         <line>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<sh/>

         <line>teen years old. </line>

         <line>
            <small_caps>Sir G. Grey</small_caps> adverted to the extraordinary object of the </line>
         <line>address, when the information desired had in fact already </line>
         <line>been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever informa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject </line>
         <line>of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt </line>
         <line>their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town </line>
         <line>newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a sys<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tem in operation by which people were driven out of the </line>
         <line>country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many </line>
         <line>slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more </line>

         <line>that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly </line>
         <line>They had these facts upon authority–that many of those fe<sh/>

            <i>Huddersfield, Tuesday</i>.–There has been no visible change </line>

            <i>Bradford, June</i> 30.–The activity we have so often had to </line>
         <line>report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six </line>
         <line>quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is par<sh/>

         <line>yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the bet<sh/>

         <line>although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers </line>
         <line>are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales </line>
         <line>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the recent London sales. </line>

         <line>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last </line>
         <line>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a </line>

            <small_caps>We</small_caps> have received the first annual Report of </line>
         <line>new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper </line>
         <line>presented in June last. The site selected for the </line>
         <line>colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, </line>
         <line>extending two or three hundred miles on each side of </line>
         <line>Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. </line>
         <line>It was anticipated that the best central station would </line>
         <line>be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on </line>
         <line>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of </line>
         <line>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and </line>
         <line>east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from </line>
         <line>Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Die<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the co<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about </line>
         <line>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is </line>
         <line>established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as </line>
         <line>an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not </line>
         <line>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration </line>
         <line>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of </line>
         <line>land at such a price as would defray the expense of </line>
         <line>conveying the emigrants from England. The plan </line>
         <line>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts </line>
         <line>into the colony. A company has embarked &#x163;35,000 </line>
         <line>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in </line>
         <line>March to examine the coast carefully, that the </line>
         <line>best site might be chosen at first, and the ne<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether </line>
         <line>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male </line>
         <line>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>males of a superior class. These numbers include 26 </line>
         <line>children. The Commissioners attempted at first to </line>
         <line>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impos<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at </line>
         <line>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they </line>
         <line>had raised the &#x163;35,000 required by the act of Parlia<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment as the condition of the grant of land. We give </line>
         <line>these few details to put our readers in a condition to </line>
         <line>understand the notices which appear from time to </line>
         <line>time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope </line>
         <line>the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the </line>
         <line>country a distinctive name. The title of "South </line>
         <line>Australia" is bad any way, and even positively ab<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>surd ; since Australia (<i>quasi</i> Australasia,) originally </line>
         <line>intended for New Holland, has already begun to be </line>
         <line>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district </line>
         <line>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general </line>
         <line>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than </line>
         <line>"South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies </line>
         <line>in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as </line>
         <line>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for </line>
         <line>the people out of them. What can be worse than a </line>

         <line>Thus the British Government is multiplying its </line>
         <line>colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive </line>
         <line>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, </line>
         <line>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of </line>
         <line>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, </line>
         <line>500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described, at </line>
         <line>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ; </line>
         <line>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west </line>
         <line>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 </line>
         <line>miles north from King George's South. All these </line>
         <line>colonies are in the temperate zone, between the lati<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the </line>
         <line>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, </line>
         <line>on the north coast, within the torried zone, in latitude </line>
         <line>12 ; but it was found to be very unhealthy, and was </line>

            <small_caps>The</small_caps> Annual Report on Emigration just issued </line>
         <line>contains, besides the usual, correspondences and </line>
         <line>documents connected with the plan which has been </line>
         <line>some time in operation, of transferring labourers from </line>
         <line>India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed </line>
         <line>to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this sub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>jest for the present, we shall state the general results[?] </line>
         <line>of the emigration to Canada. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Report shows, that the whole number of </line>
         <line>emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal, in the </line>
         <line>last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly </line>
         <line>29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration </line>
         <line>were 1831 and 1832, the numbers for these years be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing respectively 50,254 and 51,746. The proportions[?] [?] </line>
         <line>furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years </line>
         <line>were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were </line>
         <line>five Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. </line>
         <line>Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off </line>
         <line>three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about </line>
         <line>nine times as may as England; and it should be </line>
         <line>added, that a certain part of the emigration from </line>
         <line>England is artificial, consisting of paupers sent out at </line>
         <line>the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the </line>
         <line>most natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a </line>
         <line>country of its redundant or unemployed population ; </line>
         <line>and it may be asked, why it is so much less resorted to </line>
         <line>in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] </line>
         <line>be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead </line>
         <line>to the inference that the Irish, who emigrate in the </line>
         <line>largest numbers, were the best informed of the three </line>
         <line>nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor </line>
         <line>Laws, which hold out to the labourer the certainty of </line>
         <line>a subsistence at home, however idle or improvident he </line>
         <line>may be, and render him averse to live in the colo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nies, where he would have no such resource. This is </line>
         <line>only one of the many evils which these laws have pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>duced, not only to the country at large, but to the la<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bouring classes themselves, whose average condition </line>
         <line>was greatly deteriorated, while only a fraction of their </line>
         <line>number shared the benefit of the allowance. We </line>
         <line>speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act </line>
         <line>of 1834 was passed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The number of emigrants who went to Canada </line>
         <line>last year was 21,901, of whom 1399 went from </line>
         <line>Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from </line>
         <line>Ireland, and 274 from Nova Scotia, Newfound<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land, or the West Indies. In 1836 the number of </line>
         <line>emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from </line>
         <line>which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, </line>
         <line>Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837, </line>
         <line>4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper Cana<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>da, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two </line>
         <line>died in the hospital or quarantine station. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British </line>
         <line>emigrants have landed at new York, or fully 26,000 </line>
         <line>per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] </line>
         <line>tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only </line>
         <line>16,000 ; in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than </line>
         <line>59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728 who went to Canada, </line>
         <line>no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New </line>
         <line>York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. </line>
         <line>There is a discrepancy, however, between this account </line>
         <line>and another in a different Return, also newly pub<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lished. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration," makes the number who went to the United </line>
         <line>States from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The for<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mer probably comprehends all British born subjects, </line>
         <line>including persons from Nova Scotia, Canada, and the </line>
         <line>West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of </line>
         <line>whom returned. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Agent-General gives the number of persons </line>
         <line>who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United </line>
         <line>States for every year since 1825. We present merely </line>
         <line>the average for the last year seven years. </line>

         <line>73[?],[?] </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nies was no less than 103,140. The number who </line>
         <line>went out to Australia in 1837, was much greater than </line>
         <line>in any preceding year, being 5054. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his pas<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sage, &amp;c., or has in his pocket &#x163;30, the average net[?] </line>
         <line>expended on emigration will be about two millions per </line>
         <line>annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human </line>
         <line>beings form no inconsiderable <i>item</i>, in number and </line>
         <line>value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we sup<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pose it is by far the most flourishing, and by no means </line>
         <line>the least advantageous branch of the national com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>merce. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The annual increment of the population of </line>
         <line>British Isles is about 330,000, independently of the </line>
         <line>efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be </line>
         <line>about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] </line>
         <line>more inhabitants in the country each day than there </line>
         <line>were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] </line>
         <line>emigration carries off 200. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The establishment of steam navigation across the </line>
         <line>Atlantic will, no doubt, give a new impulse to the </line>
         <line>circulation of human beings, while the construction of </line>
         <line>railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada, </line>
         <line>will greatly increase the capacity of the western world </line>
         <line>to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years </line>
         <line>hence, the journey from London to Missouri will be </line>
         <line>shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the </line>
         <line>journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years </line>
         <line>ago. A religious man might see something like the </line>

         <line>France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, </line>
         <line>begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant po<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pulation, inventions have started into existence which </line>
         <line>may be said to annihilate space, and bring the most </line>
         <line>thinly inhabited parts of the world, into juxtaposition </line>
         <line>with the most overpeopled. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From the American Almanac, we find that the num<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ber of passengers who arrived in the United States in </line>
         <line>1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were native Ameri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cans. The proportion of emigrants from the different </line>
         <line>foreign countries was– </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>From the British Isles, 47,792 </line>
         <line>... British American Colonies, 2,681 </line>
         <line>... Germany, 20,142 </line>
         <line>... France, 4,443 </line>
         <line>... Prussia, 563 </line>
         <line>... Switzerland, 465 </line>
         <line>... Denmark, 414 </line>
         <line>... Holland, 298 </line>
         <line>... Mexico, 797 </line>
         <line>... Texas, 698 </line>

         <line>... Other countries, 2,152 </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this </line>
         <line>table, as to the motives which induce men to leave </line>
         <line>their native country. <i>Celeris paribus</i>, there is most </line>
         <line>emigration where there is most intelligence. Thus, </line>
         <line>Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States, </line>
         <line>and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while </line>
         <line>Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much, </line>
         <line>however, must depend on the domestic condition of </line>
         <line>the country, and on the greater or less facilities for </line>
         <line>removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and </line>
         <line>the small number of its inhabitants, the spirit of emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration must be much more active in Switzerland, </line>
         <line>which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which </line>
         <line>sends out 4443. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The magistrates of New York, it appears, con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sider the influx of emigrants a nuisance, and it </line>
         <line>would seem, from an expression of Mr Buchanan's, the </line>
         <line>agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dol<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. </line>
         <line>The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in </line>
         <line>the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in </line>
         <line>June last, that the expense of City Almshouses in the </line>
         <line>preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or &#x163;44,000 ; that </line>
         <line>of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were </line>
         <line>aliens ; and that the whole number under the charge </line>
         <line>of the Commissioners was 3074, of whom three-fourths </line>
         <line>were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor </line>
         <line>at the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive </line>
         <line>each week ; our streets are filled with the wandering </line>
         <line>crowds of those passengers, clustering in our city, </line>
         <line>unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without </line>
         <line>employment, without friends, many not speaking our </line>
         <line>language, without any dependence for food, or rainment[?], </line>
         <line>or fireside." In Boston and Philadelphia, also, nearly </line>
         <line>one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreign<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ers. </line>

      <p>
         <line>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in </line>
         <line>the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the </line>
         <line>chair. </line>
      </p>

            <small_caps>The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales.</small_caps>
         </line>
         <line>–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him </line>
         <line>to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, </line>
         <line>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South </line>
         <line>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in </line>
         <line>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in </line>
         <line>connection with the Church of Scotland. Since that </line>
         <line>time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, </line>
         <line>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion with great satisfaction. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then </line>
         <line>read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving </line>
         <line>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to </line>
         <line>the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the </line>
         <line>Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr </line>
         <line>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship </line>
         <line>explained, that in doing this the Government had no </line>
         <line>wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these </line>
         <line>gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were </line>
         <line>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, </line>
         <line>they could not be continued so long as they defied her </line>
         <line>authority. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nimously expressed their satisfaction with the prompti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tude and decision which the Government had shown </line>
         <line>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed </line>
         <line>to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther </line>
         <line>proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr </line>
         <line>Lang was now on his way to this country. </line>

         <line>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will </line>
         <line>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing, as was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, </line>
         <line>in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court </line>
         <line>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening </line>
         <line>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nimously agreed to–That the Commission having con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far </line>
         <line>as that evidence is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find </line>
         <line>it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of </line>
         <line>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication </line>
         <line>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting </line>
         <line>to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two </line>
         <line>other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a </line>
         <line>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he </line>
         <line>ought to be deposed from the office of the holy minis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce </line>
         <line>the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<sh/>

         <line>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles </line>

         <line>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the </line>
         <line>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present </line>
         <line>opportunity of stating to the Commission, that within </line>
         <line>the last three or four days a petition and complaint had </line>
         <line>been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to </line>
         <line>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the </line>
         <line>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, </line>
         <line>and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued </line>
         <line>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that </line>
         <line>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him </line>
         <line>to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rity of the Commission itself. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in </line>
         <line>commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carry<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing through the settlement amidst many difficulties, </line>
         <line>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying </line>
         <line>circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve </line>
         <line>that they will to the utmost of their power encourage </line>
         <line>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they </line>
         <line>may be subjected by their execution of the sentence </line>
         <line>of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>mission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and </line>
         <line>temperate firmness with which they have practically </line>
         <line>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of </line>
         <line>the Church."/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion on this subject; but with the views which he enter<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could </line>
         <line>concur in the motion proposed, and he must therefore </line>
         <line>dissent from it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against </line>
         <line>Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of </line>
         <line>the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus </line>
         <line>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr </line>
         <line>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission </line>
         <line>for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, </line>
         <line>that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, </line>
         <line>it would be premature at present to take any steps </line>
         <line>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official </line>
         <line>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of </line>
         <line>Dunkeld. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this </line>
         <line>reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at </line>
         <line>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr </line>
         <line>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; </line>
         <line>and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the inde<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pendence of the Church, he, as a member of Commis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to </line>
         <line>bear his share. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive </line>
         <line>pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, </line>
         <line>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, </line>
         <line>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient </line>
         <line>for the Commission to adopt such a resolution. </line>

         <line>attempt at murder by shooting took palce at Greenock. </line>
         <line>A young man from Edinburgh, an intended emigrant </line>
         <line>for New South Wales, by the Palmyra, drew from his </line>
         <line>pocked a pistol, and shot in the head a person who had </line>
         <line>been appointed by his friends to see him on board, and </line>
         <line>to look to his affairs before the sailing of the vessel. </line>
         <line>The wounded man was taken to the Infirmary in a </line>
         <line>very dangerous state, and the assailant to the jail. </line>
         <line>It appears that the young man has for some time past </line>
         <line>been behaving in a manner which made his friends </line>
         <line>chary of intrusting him with money in this country, </line>
         <line>and that they had employed the individual referred to, </line>
         <line>to see him on board for Australia, before leaving any </line>
         <line>under his charge. This indignity is supposed to have </line>
         <line>lain heavy on his mind, and led to the commission of </line>
         <line>the act above recorded.–<i>Ibid.</i>

         <line>where the yellow fern doth wave its head,– </line>
         <line>Where the hands of night the dew hath laid,– </line>
         <line>And the winds, that wander to and fro, </line>
         <line>Kiss the brown leaflets as they go,– </line>
         <line>Where the morning sun peeps in, so mild, </line>
         <line>To the dark green nooks of the woodland wild ? </line>
         <line>The woodland wild ! –where the dun deer roam, </line>
         <line>And the song-birds build them a happy home,– </line>
         <line>Where the grass is green, and the turf so sweet, </line>
         <line>Seems shorn by the tread of fairy feet,– </line>
         <line>Where the daylight comes, so richly dim, </line>
         <line>And the cushat's coo seems a hermit's hymn, </line>
         <line>The care-worn heart might be self-beguiled </line>
         <line>To forget its woes in the woodland wild ! </line>
         <line>The woodland wild ! –where the hazels grow, </line>

         <line>Where the God-built sky is in patches seen </line>

         <line>If thy faith in the right be firm and sure, </line>
         <line>Go, wander the woodlands parth within, </line>
         <line>And the love of Nature woo and win; </line>
         <line>Drink of the cup of beauty there, </line>
         <line>Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air; </line>
         <line>For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled </line>
         <line>On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild </line>
         <line>The woodlan wild !–long, long ago, </line>
         <line>I have buried myself its leaves below, </line>
         <line>And dreamed of its beauteous tenants all,– </line>
         <line>'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! </line>
         <line>'Tis the spot where the wondrous monk of old, </line>
         <line>His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold; </line>
         <line>By its door a crystal springlet boiled, </line>
         <line>For the pilgrim to drink, in the woodlan wild! </line>
         <line>The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories </line>
         <line>Make sunlight over its olden glories,– </line>
         <line>Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold, </line>
         <line>The raids they made, and the tales they told ! </line>
         <line>In winter, in spring, and in summer time, </line>
         <line>The glorious forests are aye in prime ; </line>
         <line>For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, </line>
         <line>Those grassy glades in the woodland wild! </line>
         <line>The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! </line>
         <line>Away with me, and its gladness taste; </line>
         <line>We will wander beside each gushing stream, </line>
         <line>Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; </line>
         <line>We will follow its paths and pluck its flowers, </line>
         <line>And lie on its grass in the evening hours, </line>
         <line>Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, </line>
         <line>Warns us away from the woodland wild ! </line>

         <line>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round </line>
         <line>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell </line>
         <line>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: </line>
         <line>Richard Bentley. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We have been somewhat disappointed in these </line>
         <line>volumes. We expected to have found them, like </line>
         <line>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding </line>
         <line>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on </line>
         <line>the subject throughout the whole of the first vo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what </line>
         <line>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary ap<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the </line>
         <line>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs </line>
         <line>us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate </line>
         <line>the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and </line>
         <line>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, </line>
         <line>subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched </line>
         <line>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the </line>
         <line>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one </line>
         <line>of very secondary prominence. This, the readers </line>
         <line>of the work, at least most of them, will the more </line>
         <line>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing are the two or three chapters which the author </line>
         <line>has given on the subejct of South Sea whaling. </line>
         <line>There are full of entertaining details of both a </line>
         <line>popular and scientific character, and cannot be </line>
         <line>read without exciting a wish that larger portion </line>
         <line>of the work had been composed of such material. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In making these remarks, however, we are far </line>
         <line>from intending to depreciate the sort of informa<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South </line>
         <line>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>lumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that </line>
         <line>it is not what we expected from the title of the </line>
         <line>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, </line>
         <line>we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches </line>
         <line>very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions </line>
         <line>and curious details of native character, which is </line>
         <line>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of </line>
         <line>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently </line>
         <line>seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congrega<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native </line>
         <line>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a </line>
         <line>beaver hat surmounting a person naked except </line>
         <line>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire </line>
         <line>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"/&gt;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted </line>
         <line>by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate </line>
         <line>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of </line>
         <line>ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea </line>
         <line>Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither </line>
         <line>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the </line>
         <line>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dicament. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Another remark of the author's not less strik<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing–mark it well and take comfort from it ye </line>
         <line>
            <i>bon vivants[?]</i> of the civilzed world–is, that disease </line>
         <line>is as abundant amongst the native islanders as </line>
         <line>amongst the most refined of their species, and from </line>
         <line>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as </line>
         <line>liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his </line>
         <line>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar </line>
         <line>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; </line>
         <line>alleging that the London alderman lived as long </line>
         <line>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his </line>
         <line>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with </line>
         <line>civic dignitary and his good living, or whether </line>
         <line>any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, </line>
         <line>we cannot say. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, </line>
         <line>and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a </line>
         <line>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned </line>
         <line>phraseology. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We conclude with an extract from that portion </line>
         <line>of the work which, from its great interest, we </line>
         <line>regretted was not larger, but which, limited </line>
         <line>as it is, is so full of curious information, and so </line>
         <line>crowded with remarkable incident, as to render </line>
         <line>the selection by no means an easy task. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ </line>
         <line>their tail when attacked, but prove active and danger<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek </line>
         <line>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them </line>
         <line>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush </line>
         <line>them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes </line>
         <line>continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and </line>
         <line>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a </line>
         <line>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, </line>
         <line>and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>countable manner, keeping its formidable lower jaw </line>
         <line>suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and </line>
         <line>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe </line>
         <line>this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth </line>
         <line>in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such </line>
         <line>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some </line>
         <line>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's </line>
         <line>crew to leap into the water, and support themselves </line>
         <line>by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has </line>
         <line>passed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered </line>
         <line>a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off </line>
         <line>her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood </line>
         <line>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from </line>
         <line>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to </line>
         <line>retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was </line>
         <line>destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of the </line>
         <line>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact </line>
         <line>with the animal's jaw. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>city occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>corded in the fate of the American South-Seaman </line>
         <line>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel, when cruis<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked </line>
         <line>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a </line>
         <line>school of whales, and the ship was attending them to </line>
         <line>windward. The master and second mate were engaged </line>
         <line>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the </line>
         <line>school, and the chief mate had returned on board to </line>
         <line>equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been </line>
         <line>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew </line>
         <line>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ported that a large whale was coming rapidly down </line>
         <line>upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the </line>
         <line>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sequently a male, and probably the guardian of the </line>
         <line>school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, </line>
         <line>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the con<sh/>
         </line>

         <line>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>served to retire to some distance, and again rush upon </line>
         <line>the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head </line>
         <line>struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding </line>
         <line>portion of the planks, and the people on board had </line>
         <line>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled </line>
         <line>with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, </line>
         <line>however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats </line>
         <line>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a </line>
         <line>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course </line>
         <line>for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a </line>
         <line>fatal error. At the time the accident happened they </line>
         <line>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of about </line>
         <line>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society </line>
         <line>Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their </line>
         <line>boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short </line>
         <line>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that </line>
         <line>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race </line>
         <line>of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the </line>
         <line>coast of Peru, and in the attempt were exposed for a </line>
         <line>lengthened period in extreme privations."/&gt;</line>

         <line>A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to </line>

         <line>a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, </line>
         <line>adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to </line>
         <line>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwith<sh/>

         <line>standing this <i>ruse</i> the animal was not destroyed with<sh/>

      <p>
         <line>(<i>From the Glasgow Argus.</i>) </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed of the working classes, was held in the Justi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of memo<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rializing Lord John Russell in favour of obtaining </line>
         <line>the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded </line>
         <line>to excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that </line>
         <line>the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry </line>
         <line>out their usual course of obstruction to the particular </line>
         <line>business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a </line>
         <line>resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand </line>
         <line>through the medium of funds raised by the sale of </line>
         <line>lands in the colony, and addressed the meeting at </line>
         <line>some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm, jun. </line>
         <line>a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long </line>
         <line>speech, proposed an amendment; to the effect that </line>
         <line>while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New </line>
         <line>Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so </line>
         <line>disposed, they objected to any application being </line>
         <line>made for a grant of public money for any such pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pose–that they were opposed to the question of emi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gration being allowed to occupy public attention, &amp;c. </line>
         <line>and concluded with the statement that emigration </line>
         <line>would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed </line>
         <line>operatives, and that bad laws were the chief cause of </line>
         <line>all their present sufferings, &amp;c. This amendment </line>
         <line>which was supported by the most trifling arguments </line>
         <line>we ever heard brought forward in public, was of </line>
         <line>course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord </line>
         <line>Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to </line>
         <line>take the chair on the understanding that the subject </line>
         <line>of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the atten<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion ; but here a matter, perfectly foreign to the busi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ness for which they were convened, was introduced by </line>
         <line>way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon </line>
         <line>the general policy of the country–and he had posi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tively to state that, if such an amendment was carried, </line>
         <line>he would not remain in the chair. This was received </line>
         <line>by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion, </line>
         <line>one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling </line>
         <line>alternately during the greater part of the evening. A </line>
         <line>discussion followed, in which a boy named Jack took </line>
         <line>a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that </line>
         <line>the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the </line>
         <line>subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was </line>
         <line>gravely and indignantly averred, that by going to New </line>
         <line>Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of </line>
         <line>being swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the </line>
         <line>contrary, the Chartists seemed to think that the means </line>
         <line>of emigration were to be supplied from the public ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chequer ; and when told that the funds were to be </line>
         <line>raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of </line>
         <line>them sagely observed that it would be much more </line>
         <line>humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those </line>
         <line>sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants ! </line>
         <line>Another favourite argument was, that every person </line>
         <line>had a right to subsist in the land that gave him </line>
         <line>birth, and that it was barbarous and cruel to send </line>
         <line>a man, however wretched, out of his native </line>
         <line>country ; also, that emigration would produce no </line>
         <line>benefit to society at home, as the places of those </line>
         <line>sent off would soon be filled by others. Of </line>
         <line>course, if these arguments had always been held </line>
         <line>good, and acted upon, the whole human family would, </line>
         <line>to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle </line>
         <line>of our race in the East, provided only the thing had </line>
         <line>been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts </line>
         <line>of the world must have been wicked, and cruel, and </line>
         <line>useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is entitled </line>
         <line>to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, </line>
         <line>on his removal to another land, his place would just be </line>
         <line>filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of </line>
         <line>the worse than childish arguments used by the Chartist </line>
         <line>spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking </line>
         <line>loudly at the door of the constitution for admission,"/&gt;</line>
         <line>cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest </line>
         <line>wisdom !–Mr John Crawford, Secretary to the New </line>
         <line>Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible </line>
         <line>remarks, to place the question of emigration to New </line>
         <line>Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they were </line>
         <line>determined to have the charter only–and till then </line>
         <line>starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, </line>
         <line>must starve on. On a division, the amendment pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed by Mr Malcolm was carried by a large majority, </line>
         <line>and, after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord </line>
         <line>Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, </line>
         <line>however, till the Chartists were called upon to be at </line>
         <line>their posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address </line>
         <line>the Queen–to render themselves, of course, a little </line>
         <line>more odious by another stretch of their obstructive </line>
         <line>power–if they can. </line>

         <column/>
         <line>On Monday a discussion of some interest took </line>
         <line>place in the House of Commons relative to the </line>
         <line>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fects in its government, that colony has fallen </line>
         <line>into a state of financial embarassment requiring </line>
         <line>immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the </line>
         <line>history of the settlement from its foundation, and </line>
         <line>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed </line>
         <line>&#x163;20,000 its expenditure has increased to the </line>
         <line>enormous sum of &#x163;130,000 a year ! At present </line>
         <line>its affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sponsible Ministers of the Crown having no di<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rect control over its expenditure. This is mani<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future </line>
         <line>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to </line>
         <line>provide for the payment of certain bills now </line>
         <line>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to </line>
         <line>guarantee a loan of &#x163;210,000 for this purpose. </line>
         <line>Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of </line>
         <line>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though </line>
         <line>that the Government ought not to demand a </line>
         <line>loan until they had brought in a bill to explain </line>
         <line>distinctly the principles on which they proposed </line>
         <line>that the colony should henceforth be governed. </line>
         <line>Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment should ask a vote of credit for the sum re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case, </line>
         <line>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was </line>
         <line>deferred till Friday. </line>

         <line>gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of </line>
         <line>gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was </line>
         <line>for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues </line>
         <line>were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue </line>
         <line>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was </line>
         <line>calculated to be about &#x163;25,000 a year ; and had that been all </line>
         <line>the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in </line>
         <line>fact it had ever since averaged nearly &#x163;60,000. It was not </line>
         <line>reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account </line>
         <line>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of </line>
         <line>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive </line>
         <line>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, </line>
         <line>whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so </line>
         <line>assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the </line>
         <line>colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, </line>
         <line>which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. What<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ever value the mother country might be entitled to claim </line>
         <line>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not </line>
         <line>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and </line>
         <line>if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium </line>
         <line>from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon </line>
         <line>the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of </line>
         <line>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient </line>
         <line>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which </line>
         <line>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled </line>
         <line>to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No </line>
         <line>less than &#x163;260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to </line>
         <line>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that </line>
         <line>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, </line>
         <line>where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this </line>
         <line>country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered </line>
         <line>the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for </line>
         <line>the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. </line>
         <line>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been </line>
         <line>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>[?] would be applied to emigration. </line>

      <p>
         <line>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the </line>
         <line>Legislative Cuncil of New South Wales, on the </line>
         <line>subject of immigration into colony. The </line>
         <line>object of these resolutions is to encourage emigra<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion from the mother country, by showing the </line>
         <line>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the </line>
         <line>advantages offered to the immigrant. We have </line>
         <line>only room for a few of the more important resolu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tions :ߝ </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony </line>
         <line>an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in </line>
         <line>every branch of industry ; that there is ample employ<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages </line>
         <line>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>enced in colder countries during the winter months ; </line>
         <line>and that, even during the worst period of the past </line>
         <line>severe drought, no persons able and willing to work </line>
         <line>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there </line>
         <line>can be no more advantageous field for the employment </line>
         <line>of industry than is presented in New South Wales– </line>
         <line>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years </line>
         <line>after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers </line>
         <line>to be themselves employers of labour; by which pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cess, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and </line>
         <line>herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional </line>
         <line>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may </line>
         <line>arise. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved. That this Council would particulary in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stance the large and increasing sums at the credit of </line>
         <line>the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South </line>
         <line>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perous condition, the deposits having increased from </line>
         <line>&#x163;24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to &#x163;127,000 </line>
         <line>on 31st August 1840. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved. That great additiona advantage must </line>
         <line>accrue to the mother country from the large consump<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tion in this colony of British produce and manufac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, </line>
         <line>according to the official returns for that period, </line>
         <line>amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having </line>
         <line>progressively increased from &#x163;280,000, the amount in </line>
         <line>1826, to &#x163;1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from </line>
         <line>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>creased from &#x163;106,600 in the former year, to &#x163;948,776 </line>
         <line>in the latter–the total amount being &#x163;6,187,530 for the </line>
         <line>whole period. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>try and this colony, together with the whale fisheries </line>
         <line>in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery </line>
         <line>for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to </line>
         <line>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to </line>
         <line>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that </line>
         <line>this field for the employment of British shipping must </line>
         <line>increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– </line>
         <line>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, </line>
         <line>to the fostering care of the British Government. </line>

            <small_caps>Emigration to New Zealand.</small_caps>–On Friday the </line>
         <line>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the </line>
         <line>river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. </line>
         <line>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 </line>
         <line>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the </line>
         <line>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of </line>
         <line>other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, </line>
         <line>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of </line>
         <line>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort </line>
         <line>of the emigrants on board were certainly very com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>plete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those </line>
         <line>persons sent out by the company will be provided </line>
         <line>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a </line>
         <line>great quantity of patent preserved provisions being </line>
         <line>shipped for that purpose on board the Tyne. There </line>
         <line>are a greater number of children than usual in the </line>
         <line>Emigration Depot–many of the families consisting of </line>
         <line>from eight to twelve individuals. The Prince Rupert, </line>
         <line>which now lies in the London Dock, will clear out on </line>
         <line>the 10th inst ; and it is supposed she will pretty well </line>
         <line>clear the depot of its present inmates. </line>

         <line>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>day, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, </line>
         <line>by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels </line>
         <line>with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of </line>
         <line>New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and </line>
         <line>several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there </line>
         <line>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who ap<sh/>

         <line>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, </line>
         <line>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large </line>

         <line>about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and </line>
         <line>splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The </line>
         <line>evening was very clear, the sky being without a </line>
         <line>cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, </line>
         <line>a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illu<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the </line>
         <line>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth </line>
         <line>and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, </line>
         <line>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The pheno<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong </line>
         <line>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of </line>
         <line>the moon, having at the time somewhat of the </line>
         <line>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but </line>
         <line>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to </line>
         <line>dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sembling that of a rocket, but composed of the </line>
         <line>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind </line>
         <line>it for a short distance, adding much to its spen<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dour, and giving the whole an appearance at once </line>
         <line>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it </line>
         <line>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ance, and then burst for an instant enve<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and </line>
         <line>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared </line>
         <line>to pass from the south to the north, inclining to<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>wards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst </line>
         <line>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>teor of the same kind, but much less in size, </line>
         <line>brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in </line>
         <line>a quartr rather farther to the south, a few mi<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>nutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of </line>

         <line>The <i>Falkland Islands</i> have been nominally a </line>
         <line>British colony for some years; but, in conse<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>quence of representations made to Government by </line>
         <line>various persons interested in the trade to the South </line>
         <line>Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for esta<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>blishing a body of settlers in these islands. It </line>
         <line>was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred </line>
         <line>it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the </line>
         <line>Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was </line>
         <line>approved. Rules were prepared by the Com<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>missioners of Emigration ; a vote of &#x163;3750 was </line>
         <line>put into the estimates for the first year's ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have </line>
         <line>not been taken already to send out emigrants, we </line>
         <line>presume they will be taken about the beginning </line>
         <line>of next winter, which is their summer. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>These islands are about 300 miles from the </line>
         <line>south extremity of the American continent, in a </line>
         <line>latitude corresponding with that of London. </line>
         <line>Their climate, however, very closely resembles </line>
         <line>that of Shetland. They have cold summers and </line>
         <line>mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but </line>
         <line>owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, </line>
         <line>and the stormy winds which blow almost con<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>stantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in </line>
         <line>them, and even oats might turn out to be a pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>carious crop. It is doubted also if wood will </line>
         <line>grow, and at present there is not a single tree in </line>
         <line>the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, </line>
         <line>and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which </line>
         <line>some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, </line>
         <line>thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>troduced and found to do well. Extensive peat<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of </line>
         <line>fuel. The present population consists of twenty<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> five persons, young and old–one-half of them </line>
         <line>British, the other Gauchos, South American In<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>dians of a semi-civilised description. They are </line>
         <line>all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural har<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bour, where a British officer resides. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The islands are numerous, but all very small </line>
         <line>except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 </line>
         <line>square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scot<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land. They are deeply perforated by arms of the </line>
         <line>sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine </line>
         <line>natural harbours than any country of equal ex<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tent in the world. Their shores afford excellent </line>
         <line>fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly </line>
         <line>numerous. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The great object in establishing a colony here </line>
         <line>is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>fitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, </line>
         <line>which are yearly increasing in number. Every </line>
         <line>vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from </line>
         <line>it, passes within sight of these islands, or near </line>
         <line>them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass </line>
         <line>these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, </line>
         <line>and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The </line>
         <line>trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, </line>
         <line>most of which return to England by this route, </line>
         <line>which will also be preferred by vessels trading to </line>
         <line>New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, </line>
         <line>and probably South Australia. From Sydney or </line>
         <line>Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by </line>
         <line>Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the </line>
         <line>prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>yond the 30th, renders the latter route the more </line>
         <line>advantageous on the outward voyage, and the </line>
         <line>former on the return. The Falkland Islands are </line>
         <line>about half as distant from Britain as New South </line>
         <line>Wales. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Emigration Board recommend that Govern<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment should send out two surveyors to select an </line>
         <line>eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in </line>
         <line>blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivid<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ed. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at </line>
         <line>12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in </line>
         <line>carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying </line>
         <line>the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in </line>
         <line>the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, </line>
         <line>or catching and taming them, might be sold to </line>
         <line>the settlers or a company. The climate is unin<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>viting, but there is little doubt that persons ac<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>customed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> hunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profit<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>able trade here. A vast number of ships, making </line>
         <line>long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well </line>
         <line>as British, pass the islands, and to these it would </line>
         <line>be a great accommodation to find supplies of pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>visions and the means of refitting here. Some of </line>
         <line>our starving population in the North of Scotland </line>
         <line>or the Islands, might better their circumstances </line>
         <line>by removing to the Falkland Islands. </line>

         <line>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>land Company to Lord John Russell will serve to re<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>move all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, </line>
         <line>with regard to the relations between that colony and </line>
         <line>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first </line>
         <line>names in the country honoured this splendid banquet </line>
         <line>by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, </line>
         <line>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only </line>
         <line>by one common feeling. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The public are now tolerably familiar with the </line>
         <line>natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears </line>
         <line>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great </line>
         <line>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with </line>
         <line>must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New </line>
         <line>Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, </line>
         <line>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most </line>
         <line>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the </line>
         <line>character to the native population, led him to antici<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>pate that these islands were likely to become the </line>
         <line>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John </line>
         <line>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for </line>
         <line>adding these important islands to the great colonial </line>
         <line>empire of this country. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and </line>
         <line>deservedly applauded. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation </line>
         <line>of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour </line>
         <line>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the pros<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It </line>
         <line>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent </line>
         <line>my humble efforts in support of those exertions that </line>
         <line>had been made, and were about to be made, by the </line>
         <line>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I </line>
         <line>should be unworthy of your approbation if I took </line>
         <line>any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the </line>
         <line>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of </line>
         <line>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>moting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– </line>
         <line>all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the </line>
         <line>enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With </line>
         <line>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we </line>
         <line>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<sh/></line>
         <line>lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion </line>
         <line>I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not </line>
         <line>being blind to the importance and value of those opi<sh/></line>
         <line>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his </line>
         <line>own merits, in recommending the adoption of these </line>
         <line>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood </line>
         <line>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to </line>
         <line>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him </line>
         <line>a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the </line>
         <line>sagacity with which he had appreciated the import<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the </line>
         <line>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious </line>
         <line>measure of setting up the British flag in them. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's </line>
         <line>Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received </line>
         <line>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr La<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was </line>
         <line>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to </line>
         <line>the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the </line>
         <line>Government favour among the commercial classes. </line>
         <line>His lordship may well be proud, that though New </line>
         <line>Zealand was formally taken possession of in the name </line>
         <line>of the Sovereign of this country many years ago, it </line>
         <line>was reserved for him to make it a British colony. </line>

         <line>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of </line>
         <line>the persons who have <i>emigrated</i>," we can scarcely </line>
         <line>suppose that it includes persons who went out to </line>
         <line>the countries mentioned on business, without any </line>
         <line>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, </line>
         <line>the number who went to the United States in </line>
         <line>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<sh/>
         </line>
         <line> thirds of what stands in the above table. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant </line>
         <line>to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet sure<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ly some persons go with the express view of re<sh/>

         <line>maining in these countries. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The number of person who were enabled to </line>
         <line>emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in </line>
         <line>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, </line>
         <line>for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<sh/>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>There are returns of land sold, but not in a </line>
         <line>very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, </line>
         <line>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. </line>
         <line>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and </line>
         <line>12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted </line>
         <line>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those </line>
         <line>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New </line>
         <line>Brunswick, and Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres </line>
         <line>have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to </line>
         <line>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable. </line>

      <p>
         <line>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the </line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The sales were chiefly by auction. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, </line>
         <line>were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in West<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, </line>
         <line>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in </line>
         <line>South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales </line>
         <line>of land are no bad index of the progress of the </line>
         <line>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those </line>
         <line>which were advancing most rapidly in the three </line>
         <line>years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money </line>
         <line>received in payment of land in these two colonies </line>
         <line>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to &#x163;307,647; and, if </line>
         <line>we understand the report correctly, the whole of </line>
         <line>this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to </line>
         <line>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with </line>
         <line>them, or expended on their passage, twenty </line>
         <line>pounds each; and thus the money which left the </line>
         <line>country must have amounted to upwards of two </line>
         <line>millions. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>This gigantic emigration one of the things </line>
         <line>which convey an idea of the immense resources of </line>
         <line>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the </line>
         <line>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we </line>
         <line>believe it may be safely said, that all the other </line>
         <line>eight parts do not send out half the number of </line>
         <line>emigrants annually which are sent by the British </line>
         <line>Isles alone. </line>

         <line>Solicitor–James Norton, Esq. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Company was established and incorporated </line>
         <line>(and is now in full operation) to carry out in Aus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tralia a principle which has been acted on with great </line>
         <line>success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money </line>
         <line>in this country, at a moderate rate of interest, on </line>
         <line>the credit of a large invested capital, and laying it </line>
         <line>out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher rate. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable </line>
         <line>notes, under the Corporation seal, to persons desirous </line>
         <line>of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The </line>
         <line>notes will be for &#x163;100 each, or any larger sum desired </line>
         <line>by the lender, and will be made payable at any period </line>
         <line>which may be agreed upon, not being shorter than </line>
         <line>two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate </line>
         <line>of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on </line>
         <line>the 15th January and 15th July), on the production </line>
         <line>of the half-yearly vouchers, which will be annexed </line>
         <line>to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render </line>
         <line>it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the </line>
         <line>note itself until the principal becomes due. The </line>
         <line>form of note has been preferred to that of bond, as </line>
         <line>admitting of transfer without expense or trouble, </line>
         <line>whilst it affords equal security to the holder. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Colonial Board has been established in Syd<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ney, and the operation of the Company are at pre<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>sent confined to New South Wales. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Security being the first object of the Company, all </line>
         <line>the arrangements have been framed with the view to </line>
         <line>attain that end. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per </line>
         <line>cent, although the current rate is much higher. </line>
         <line>The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral se<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>curity) must not be of less value than double </line>
         <line>the amount of the loan. </line>
         <line>The non-payment of interest on the day it be<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>comes due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per </line>
         <line>cent, additional interest for the period in ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rear; and all parties in default for ten days </line>
         <line>are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of </line>
         <line>the Company "without further instructions"</line>
         <line>and "without distinction or exception of any </line>
         <line>person whatever."</line>
         <line>The Colonial Board only draws on the Company, </line>
         <line>as loans are agreed on; their bills must be ad<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vertised for public competition and the pur<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>chasers pay the amount, in exchange for the </line>
         <line>Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital </line>
         <line>of which is &#x163;1,200,00) to the credit of the </line>
         <line>Company, to be drawn out by checks of </line>
         <line>the Colonial Board in favour of the borrow<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ers as the mortgages are completed. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The high character of the members of the Colonial </line>
         <line>Board, affords the fullest assurance that these ar<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as </line>
         <line>well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced </line>
         <line>in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by </line>
         <line>the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the </line>
         <line>Chairman of the Colonial Board states that "he does </line>
         <line>not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment </line>
         <line>of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal </line>
         <line>of the Colonial Board."</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The high rate of interest in Australia, has at<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tracted much private capital from this country to be </line>
         <line>invested in mortgages. These investments have </line>
         <line>been made through the agency of individuals or mer<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>cantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies </line>
         <line>from which the Company is exempt. To those who </line>
         <line>may desire to make such investments, it must be ob<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>vois that the stock of the Company presents a much </line>
         <line>superior security, and the prospect of a greatly in<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>creased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a </line>
         <line>large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, </line>
         <line>the money borrowed here at half that rate. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is equally clear that those who merely seek tem<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>porary employment for their money without becoming </line>
         <line>shareholders, cannot have a better security than the </line>
         <line>Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due pay<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>ment of which, the whole capital of the Company, </line>
         <line>as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid </line>
         <line>out, stand pledged. Every shareholder is required </line>
         <line>to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he becomes </line>
         <line>bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the </line>
         <line>Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility </line>
         <line>in enforcing demands against the Company. When </line>
         <line>it is considered that the funds of the Company </line>
         <line>here are kept in Government Securities and no </line>
         <line>money lent in Australia, except on the best mort<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>gages on land, with collateral security in addition, </line>
         <line>it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the </line>
         <line>Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided prefe<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rence over mortgages in this country, which gene<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>rally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid </line>
         <line>by the Company. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed </line>
         <line>shall not exceed four times the amount of capital </line>
         <line>paid up. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>That the whole capital of the Company, and all </line>
         <line>the mortgages on which their money is lent, in Aus<sh/>
         </line>
         <line>tralia, shall constitute a security to the lenders of </line>
         <line>money to the Company. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>That the mortgages are to be on land, with the </line>

         <line>Yesterday forenoon arrived at <mention city="Portsmouth" country="United Kingdom"
               province="England">Spithead</mention>, the </line>
         <line>Lord Dorcester merchantman, Edward Howe, </line>

               province="England">London</mention>. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>In this ship came six <mention keyword="Native Americans">Cherokee</mention> Chiefs,
            of the </line>
         <line>first rank, one of them born in England. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, </line>
         <line>Sir Andrew Douglas, Commander of the Alcide, </line>
         <line>of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore </line>
         <line>to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to </line>
         <line>Bradley's, the crown Inn.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The object of these Chiefs coming to this coun<sh/></line>
         <line>try is, to endeavour to form a connection with the </line>
         <line>English Government, in order to attempt the re<sh/></line>
         <line>duction of <mention country="Mexico">Mexico</mention>, near which place they have </line>
         <line>20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more </line>
         <line>in a short time. </line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>The Cherokees have menaced that country for </line>
         <line>these last three years, and are favoured by great </line>
         <line>number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settle<sh/></line>
         <line>ments; should they, therefore, procure respectable </line>
         <line>assistance from England, the New World will be </line>
         <line>a certain conquest, and open a source of trade and </line>
         <line>wealth to this nation, that will more than com<sh/></line>
         <line>pensate for the loss of America, and the expence </line>
         <line>of attaining that grand object.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of </line>
         <line>their country, with their faces painted in an ex<sh/></line>
         <line>traordinary manner. They waited on Colonel </line>
         <line>Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some </line>
         <line>other officers of distinction. One of them, who </line>
         <line>was born in England, named Bowles, speaks Eng<sh/></line>
         <line>lish indifferently well, and is extremely communi<sh/></line>
         <line>cative. He went over to America with his pa<sh/></line>
         <line>rents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by </line>
         <line>some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he </line>
         <line>was most hospitably received, and afterwards rais<sh/></line>
         <line>ed to the highest honours of their nation.</line>
      </p>

         <line>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this </line>

         <line>intelligence:&#x2013;</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may </line>

            Governor </line>

         <line><mention keyword="war">war</mention> against the frontier inhabitants of the United </line>
         <line>States, and that quickly, that now or never was </line>

            engaged </line>
         <line>with the northern tribes.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the 30th of September, about midnight </line>

         <line>ville,) at which sundry families had collected, and </line>
         <line>fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of </line>
         <line>Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to con<sh/></line>
         <line>sist of three of our hundred. Their approach </line>
         <line>was suspected by the running of cattle, that had </line>
         <line>taken fright at them, and upon examination, they </line>
         <line>were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of </line>
         <line>the gate, and from the place and distance they </line>
         <line>received the first fire from the man who discover<sh/></line>
         <line>ed them John M'Rocy. They immediately re<sh/></line>
         <line>turned the fire, and continued a very heavy and </line>
         <line>constant firing upon the station, blockhouses sur<sh/></line>
         <line>rounded with a stockade for an hour, and were re<sh/></line>
         <line>pulsed with considerable loss, without injuring </line>
         <line>man, woman, or child, in the station.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>During the whole time of the attack, the In<sh/></line>
         <line>dians were never more distant than ten yards from </line>
         <line>the Block House, and often in large numbers </line>
         <line>close round the lower walls, attempting to put </line>
         <line>fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, </line>
         <line>where he was shot, and falling to the ground, re<sh/></line>
         <line>newed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and </line>
         <line>was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through </line>
         <line>a port hole of the over<missing type="copy blur">???</missing>ing, which lodged in </line>
         <line>the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those </line>
         <line>sticking in the walls on the outside are innume<sh/></line>
         <line>rable.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>Undoubted advices have been received that as </line>
         <line>early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 </line>
         <line>Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Chero<sh/></line>
         <line>kee towns, and below, as on their way they de<sh/></line>
         <line>cared to make war on Cumberland&#x2013;and that they</line>
         <line>were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those </line>
         <line>towns.&#x2013;This must have been the party that attack<sh/></line>
         <line>ed Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was ex<sh/></line>
         <line>pected, but it is now hoped, that the check they </line>
         <line>have received will induce them to return without </line>
         <line>making further attempts upon that settlement.</line>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the </line>
         <line>head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little Ri<sh/></line>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George </line>

         <line>and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were kil<sh/></line>

      <p>
         <line>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron </line>

         <line>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), </line>
         <line>that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire </line>

         <line>expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amount<sh/></line>

         <line>after seventeen days march from <mention keyword="Native Americans">Miami</mention>,
            reached </line>

         <line>opposition that was met with, a party of about </line>

         <line>all under the command of <mention name="Hardin, John J." dates="1 Oct 1753–1792">Col.

         <line>in the great Miami village, to pursue the track </line>
         <line>of a party of Indians which had the day before </line>
         <line>been discovered. After a pursuit of about six </line>
         <line>miles, they came up with, and were attacked by </line>
         <line>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were con<sh/></line>
         <line>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large </line>
         <line>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without </line>
         <line>exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate </line>
         <line>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the </line>
         <line>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was </line>
         <line>short and bloody; the troops were soon overpower<sh/></line>
         <line>ed by numbers, and all fell, except the two offi<sh/></line>
         <line>ers and two or three privates, after defending </line>
         <line>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<sh/></line>

            Hartshorn</mention>, of </line>

         <line>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly </line>
         <line>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, </line>
         <line>and by that means screening himself from the eye </line>

         <line>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<sh/></line>
         <line>dered his situation shocking. After this, some </line>
         <line>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, </line>
         <line>until the second capital action, which happened </line>
         <line>two days after the army left the Miami village.</line>

         <line>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to march back </line>
         <line>to the town. On their first entrance into the </line>
         <line>town, there appeared a small body of Indians, </line>
         <line>who immediately fled at the first onset, and by </line>
         <line>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by </line>
         <line>making their flight into different directions, and </line>
         <line>encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means </line>
         <line>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<sh/></line>
         <line>ans had effected their design; for the moment </line>
         <line>they found the small handful of regular troops de<sh/></line>
         <line>tached from the main body of militia, they com<sh/></line>
         <line>menced the attack with their whole force, except<sh/></line>

         <column/>
         <line>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody </line>

         <line>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<sh/></line>
         <line>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, </line>
         <line>of Hartford, and <mention name="Frothingham, Ebenezer"
               dates="14 January 1758-22 October 1790">Lieut. Frothingham</mention>, of

         <line>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, </line>

         <line>number of them fell; but being so far superior in </line>
         <line>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the </line>

         <line>two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. </line>
         <line>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead </line>
