         <line/>The population of Canada, in 1760, was reckoned 
         <line/>at 62,000 souls, whilst her exports had never ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceeded two millions of <i>livres tournois</i> (about 
         <line/>90,000l) The imports must have greatly ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of 
         <line/>the differences can be formed. The present popula<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of the Canadas may be rated at 320,000 souls ; 
         <line/>but great as this augmentation may appear, commerce 
         <line/>will be found to have greatly surpassed the propor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tional ratio of the population. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From 1763 to 1793, the exports may have varied 
         <line/>from 120,000l. to 300,000l. chiefly of wheat, furs, 
         <line/>and peltry. But, during the last 18 years, they have

      <p>
         <line/>The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at 
         <line/>Quebec is about 380,000l. Sterling. It is impossi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but 
         <line/>we may safely conlude, that they will make the to<sh/>
         M <line/>tal of importans one million Sterling, leaving a balance 
         <line/>in favour of these provinces, which, but a few years 
         <line/>ago, would have appeared incredible. This proper<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty is carried by 661 vessels, whose tonnage is 
         <line/>143,893, navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight 
         <line/>and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per 
         <line/>ton, being 1,359,788l. 17s. Sterling, which, with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out taking into consideration the charges in Britain, 
         <line/>will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed, 
         <line/>exceed 3,000,000l. Sterling, being about a tenth of 
         <line/>the imports of the United Kingdom. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our commerce has become considerable with the 
         <line/>United States. A few years ago, our imports from 
         <line/>thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since re<sh/>
         
         <line/>spectable and intelligent American merchants have 
         <line/>begun to settle amongst us, I believe the scale turned 
         <line/>in our favour ; and thus British industry is com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mencing to run in a channel never before much 
         <line/>thought of.

         <line/>"We are dreadfully alarmed at present on ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count of the great scarcity of flour throughout 
         <line/>the province. Common flour sold this morning 
         <line/>in the market at six dollars, per cwt. bran from 
         <line/>7s. 6d. to 6s. oats 3s. per bushel, and pease 20d. 
         <line/>per bushel. There has been an account taken of 
         <line/>the quantity of flour and wheat in this city, and 
         <line/>liberties, by order of the Governor and Council, 
         <line/>and we find there is not more than will serve as 
         <line/>ten days. They ar much worse off in the district 
         <line/>of Montreal than we are here: We have sent 
         <line/>them frequent supplies. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Wheat which was found too bad to be ship<sh/>
         
         <line/>ped last year at three livres, now sells at two 
         <line/>dollars. One Merchant will make upwards of 
         <line/>fifteen hundred pounds by this job. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Government, for the relief of the poor, have 
         <line/>caused to be issued, by the contractor here, rise 
         <line/>at 3 d. per lb. no one to get more than a dol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar's worth at a time. The day before yesterday 
         <line/>there was delivered above a hundred pounds worth 
         <line/>in this way.

         <line/>maged wheat were shipped yesterday for that 
         <line/>market. We have not had a grain of flour from 
         <line/>England or the States, though we hear of a car<sh/>
         
         <line/>go from New York, for Montreal. The vessel 
         <line/>was to call at New Brunswick ; and it is more 
         <line/>than probably, that people there, being in great 
         <line/>want themselves, have detained her. The Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment have done now what they should have 
         <line/>done five or six months ago, and then we should 
         <line/>not be in this starving condition ; that is, we are 
         <line/>to have a proclamation to permit the importation 
         <line/>of grain and flour from the States.

      <p>
         <line/>"My servant is just come home from the ba<sh/>
         
         <line/>ker's, where I had sent him for half a dollar's 
         <line/>worth of bread. After watching for two hours, 
         <line/>till the bread came out of the overn, he could get 
         <line/>but eighteen-pennyworth ; three small loaves, 
         <line/>indeed, weighing only two pounds each. Thir<sh/>

         <line/>"By Captain Gilbert, the bearer of this 
         <line/>you will learn our distress for want of provi-
         <line/>sions: There has not been in the whole island 
         <line/>one bushel of corn for sale for 16 days past. 
         <line/>Capt. George, from Baltimore, brought in [?] 
         <line/>days ago two bushels of corn, which sold immed<sh/>
         
         <line/>diately at 6s. 8d. per bushel; he also brought in 
         <line/>360 barrels of flour, common and superfine, which 
         <line/>sold at eight and nine dollars per barrel. No ves<sh/>
         
         <line/>sel has arrived here with provisions since Capt. 
         <line/>George; and no vessel belonging to the island is 
         <line/>expected to relieve us. A great number of poor 
         <line/>people have been for ten days past obliged to live 
         <line/>on the greens of the field. Governor Hamilton, 
         <line/>by advice of his counsel, has opened the port of 
         <line/>Bermuda to all foreign vessels whatever, for thirty 
         <line/>days, to be computed from the 30th day of March, 
         <line/>laden with bread, corn; or flour. He also allows, 
         <line/>for three months, the importation of salted pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions from any foreign port whatever, in vessels 
         <line/>belonging to these islands. IT is said, what if any 
         <line/>foreign vessel should come here after the time per<sh/>
         
         <line/>mited by proclamation, they will be allowed to 
         <line/>dispose of their cargo, if they can prove they set 
         <line/>out with an intent to come here. If any vessels 
         <line/>be ready to sail from Norfolk, with provisions, ad<sh/>

         <line/>tion, entitled, " A State of the present 
         <line/>Government of the Province of Quebec," will 
         <line/>give the public some idea of the Canada Bill, 
         <line/>which has been so much talked of an procrasti<sh/>
         
         <line/>nated so long, and at present pending in Parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. The work we understand to be the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duction of Adam Lymburner, Esq; set over by 
         <line/>the province to negotiate this afair. It is re<sh/>
         
         <line/>markable,withhis former publication, for its strong 
         <line/>nervous elocution and perspicuity of reasoning.

         <line/>"Liberty is congenial to the feelings of all 
         <line/>mankind. The security which flows from a free 
         <line/>constitution, to both political and civil liberty, 
         <line/>contributes greatly towards bringing forth the 
         <line/>powers of the human mind, and the encourage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of the industry of people ; but no con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stitution can be called free where the people are 
         <line/>not allowed to participate of the legislative au<sh/>
         
         <line/>thority by their representatives : This is the great 
         <line/>criterion of freedom; and it is extremely natural 
         <line/>for all British subjects, as they know the value of 
         <line/>it, to struggle for such a valuable right. Great 
         <line/>Britain has constantly acknoledged this prin<sh/>
         
         <column/>
         <line/>ciple in the constitution she has granted to all her 
         <line/>Colonies; and by that means has rendered them 
         <line/>more flourishing and prosperous than those of o<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther nations. Although the inhabitants of the 
         <line/>province of Quebec have, from the general ten<sh/>
         
         <line/>dency of the British government to a mild admi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nistration, enjoyed a certain degree of civil liber<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty; yet they have been, from the peculiar nature 
         <line/>of the system of their government, entirely de<sh/>
         
         <line/>prived of all political liberty. A more full enjoy<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of these essential privileges has been the 
         <line/>prayer of their petitions, and of those now be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore the House of commons. The objects prayed 
         <line/>for may be reduced to the following heads:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"1. An elective house of assembly or repre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sentatives of the people. 2. That the members 
         <line/>of the legislative council receive no salaries as 
         <line/>counsellors. 3. That the <i>habeas corpus</i>act, and 
         <line/>the other laws of England relating to personal 
         <line/>liberty,be made a part of the constitution. 4. That 
         <line/>trial by jury in civil causes be likewise made part 
         <line/>of the constitution, and that nine out of twelve 
         <line/>may return a verdict. 5. That the ancient laws 
         <line/>and customs of Canada, relative to landed pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>perty, marriage settlements, inheritance, and 
         <line/>dowers, be continued in force in the districts or

            <i>Curious Anecdote</i>.–A few days ago a stranger 
         <line/>waited on Mr. Sibbly, Treasurer of the East 
         <line/>India Company, and desired to speak to him in 
         <line/>private ; when the were retired, the stranger 
         <line/>said to Mr. Sibbly, " I am lately returned from 
         <line/>India, I have smuggled goods to the amount of 
         <line/>about 120l. What duty have I to pay upon 
         <line/>them?" Mr. Sibbly smiled, and told him, 
         <line/>"That he could receive no such money without 
         <line/>the Chairman's permission." Pray then (said 
         <line/>the stranger) speak to him of it as soon as possi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble. I am resolved to pay whatever the duty is. 
         <line/>The Company pays for the exclusive privilege 
         <line/>of bringing India goods to Europe; the man 
         <line/>that deprives them of any part of the advantages 
         <line/>they hope to reap from it, cannot, in my opinion, 
         <line/>look upon himself as a strictly honest man."/&gt;
         <line/>Since the stranger waited on Mr. Sibbly, the 
         <line/>Chairman had not had time to give him an an<sh/>
         
         <line/>swer ; the stranger notwithstanding, gave him a 
         <line/>letter, including a Bank note of 30l. The sum 
         <line/>Mr. Sibbly told him he should pay, if he paid 
         <line/>any thing.

         <line/>We left Patia Dec. 15, 1789, and went to 
         <line/>Decca, and arrived there after a passage of 16 
         <line/>days. Just as we arrived there was a famine, 
         <line/>and it was really a shocking sight to behold; 
         <line/>you could not move out of your house but the 
         <line/>corpses lay in your way, and the wild dogs and 
         <line/>jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The 
         <line/>Hindoos never bury their dead, but burn them 
         <line/>to ashes, if they can afford it ; if not, throw 
         <line/>them into the river. I have lately seen a man 
         <line/>brought to the river side, and laid down at low<sh/>
         
         <line/>water mark before he was dead ; and when the 
         <line/>the tide flowed, it carried him off. If a man, wo<sh/>
         
         <line/>man, or child, dies at night, the corpse is eaten 
         <line/>by the morning. This I have been an eye wit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback 
         <line/>every morning, I had an opportunity of seeing 
         <line/>more than those that did not. In the course of 
         <line/>six months I became so much used to it, that I 
         <line/>took no notice of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I was there when a dreadful conflagration 
         <line/>took place, and burnt upwards of seven miles with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out intermission, and many souls perished. Now 
         <line/>consider, first, an inudation; second, a famine; 
         <line/>and third, a conflagration. How much the place 
         <line/>must be distressed, I leave you to think. I left 
         <line/>Decca the 1st of December last, and arrived at 
         <line/>Calcutta, after a passage through the Sunderburns 
         <line/>(in 17 days), hearty and well, thank God."

         <line/>The old system of sending men of rank to go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vern Jamaica, seems to be revived, and laudably 
         <line/>too. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This island is the most important possession we 
         <line/>hold in the West Indies, and is well entitled to 
         <line/>any mark of distinction which the parent country 
         <line/>can bestow upon it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The salary and emoluments annexed to the 
         <line/>government of Jamaica, render it the most valua<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble of any in the King's gift, except that of Ire<sh/>
         
         <line/>land. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Soon after the Restoration, O'Brian, third 
         <line/>Earl of Inchiquin, was appointed Governor of 
         <line/>Jamaica, and died in his Government. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Henry Bentinck, first Duke of Portland, was 
         <line/>made Governor of this island in the reign of 
         <line/>George I. His Grace died at Spanish Town, 
         <line/>July 4th, 1736, in the 45th year of his age. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The death of these two Noblemen in their 
         <line/>government, gave so bad an impression of the cli<sh/>
         
         <line/>mate of Jamaica, and the insalubrity of its air, 
         <line/>that few persons of rank and fortune have been 
         <line/>ambitious of becoming governors of it, notwith 
         <line/>standing the brilliancy of the appointments an 
         <line/>nexd to the situation.

         <line/>"I have travelled through several of the States 
         <line/>and see no appearance of the poverty which you 
         <line/>hear so much boast of in Britain–every where I 
         <line/>meet rather with extravagance. Indeed they 
         <line/>procure too easily to be frugal in their out-givings. 
         <line/>All the manufactured goods imported from Eu<sh/>

            <i>a new State called</i> THE WESTERN TERRITORY,

            <i>being one of four settled by the Americans since</i>

         <line/>with goods equal in quality and price to 
         <line/>Britain, is wha the whole world knows, and from 
         <line/>experience the most obstinate rebel American dare 
         <line/>not deny: It is with pleasure, therefore, we inform 
         <line/>our readers, that the United States are paying 
         <line/>more attention to agriculture than to manufac<sh/>
         
         <line/>tures–They have already laid out four new 
         <line/>States since the beginning of their rebellion, viz. 
         <line/>
            <i>Vermont, Kentucky, Indiana, </i> and <i>The Western Ter</i>
            <sh/>
         
         <line/>ritory. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>About seventeen years ago Vermont was a wil<sh/>
         
         <line/>derness; they only began to settle it about the 
         <line/>year 1774. Kentucky, ten years ago lay in fo<sh/>
         
         <line/>rest wild; it was settled in 1780. Yet so rapid 
         <line/>has been the population, that there are not less 
         <line/>than one hundred thousand inhabitants, already, 
         <line/>in each of these states. The State of Indiana 
         <line/>was only laid off this present year in 1789, and con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tains but two or three hundred inhabitants. From 
         <line/>a description of these four States, published in 
         <line/>America in May last, we give our readers a 
         <line/>short abridged description of the last of them, 
         <line/>called <i>The Western Territory</i>; and it must re<sh/>
         
         <line/>rejoice the heart of every Briton to read it, and 
         <line/>think, that the settling of these countries, though 
         <line/>the Americans double their numbers every 15 or 
         <line/>20 years, will long keep them from manufactur<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, and is every day opening a field for new cus<sh/>
         
         <line/>tomers to Great Britain; for who will work as a 
         <line/>tradesman, even though wages are very high, 
         <line/>when he can, for twenty pounds, purchase a thou<sh/>
         
         <line/>sand acres of land, that being the present price 
         <line/>fixed by Congress for lots of land in The Western 
         <line/>Territory.–Hence the demand of our manufac<sh/>
         
         <line/>tures will continually increase with the increasing 
         <line/>population of America.–Desponding politicians 
         <line/>may derive comfort from the prospect, that new 
         <line/>channels of commerce will be opened, and the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>land parts of the Continent will require an increas<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing supply.–British manufactures will for ages 
         <line/>ascend the great rivers of that Continent, and by 
         <line/>means of a most extraordinary inland navigation, 
         <line/>will be diffused through a country more fertile, 
         <line/>more extensive, than all the Thirteen United 
         <line/>States.

               <i>The Western Territory</i>
            </center>
         
         <line/>Is the name given to this new State by Congress. 
         <line/>It is bounded on the west by the Mississippi river 
         <line/>–north by the Lakes–east by Pennsylvania℃ 
         <line/>south and south-east by the Ohio river; contains, 
         <line/>according to Mr. Hutchins, Geographer General 
         <line/>to the Congress, 411,000 square miles, equal to 
         <line/>two hundred and sixty-three millions of acres, 
         <line/>from which he deducts forth-three millions of 
         <line/>acres for water; there will then remain two hun<sh/>
         
         <line/>dred and twenty millions of acres belonging to 
         <line/>the fedœral government, which is to be sold for 
         <line/>the discharge of the debt owing to the United 
         <line/>States. But a very small proportion of these 
         <column/>
         <line/>lands is yet purchased of the native Indians and 
         <line/>disposed of by Congress*. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the lands which have been purchased by 
         <line/>Congress from the Indians two settlements are 
         <line/>already commenced–one at Marietta, the other 
         <line/>at Miami. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This State was only laid out by Congress in 
         <line/>the end of the year 1787, and already contains 
         <line/>above 8000 inhabitants. The principal rivers are 
         <line/>the Mississippi, Ohio, Muskingham, Hockhock<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, Sioto, Miami, Wobash,&amp;c–Coal and iron 
         <line/>mines, and salt pits, abound in this State; the 
         <line/>soil is excellent℃as rich as can be imagined, and 
         <line/>may be reduced to yield plentiful crops with little 
         <line/>or no labour. It is exceedingly healthy, pleasant, 
         <line/>and commodious–the most fertile spot of earth 
         <line/>known to the Europeans or Americans–exceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the soil of any of the United States. The 
         <line/>timber is tall, and in great variety℃Streams for 
         <line/>mills abound here. Wheat, indigo, hemp, and 
         <line/>cotton, thrive well. Many years will probably 
         <line/>not escape before a good part of the country will 
         <line/>be brought to that degree of cultivation that will 
         <line/>exhibit all its latent beauties, and fulfill the de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scription of travellers, who call it the <i>garden of</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>the world.</i> It is here probably also that the center 
         <line/>of a great empire will be fixed in some future pe<sh/>
         
         <line/>riod. It is the most centrical place for Congress 
         <line/>to accommodate themselves at. No country is 
         <line/>better stocked with wild game of every kind; 
         <line/>herds of deers, elks, bears, &amp;c fill the extensive 
         <line/>meadows of thie country℃turkies, geese, swans, 
         <line/>and partridges, &amp;c. are innumerable. The rivers 
         <line/>are excellently stored with fish, and almost all na<sh/>
         
         <line/>vigable for small sloops. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the ordinance published by Congress for 
         <line/>the government of this territory, they are to 
         <line/>be allowed an Assembly when their number a<sh/>
         
         <line/>mounts to 30,000 persons; and when they ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>quire a certain degree of population they are to 
         <line/>have representatives in Congress; and when fifty 
         <line/>millions of acres are settled they are to be divided 
         <line/>into States. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Rejoice, O Britons! that they must all be sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>plied with manufactures by you, and you <i>only!</i>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>* No more than about twelve millions of acres have

            <enlarged_capital>O</enlarged_capital>N Saturday last between three and four 
         <line/>o'clock, P. M. happened the most violent 
         <line/>hurricane pest, or thunder storm (for we are at 
         <line/>a lost to determine its proper name) that was 
         <line/>ever known in this borough or its vicinity. We 
         <line/>can conceive of nothing but an earthquake, that 
         <line/>could be attended with more alarming circum<sh/>
         
         <line/>stances. The cloud from the west, or rather a 
         <line/>number of clouds of a lowering aspect, furiously 
         <line/>agitated, broken, and seemingly ready to fall– 
         <line/>attracted the attention, and prepared the mind 
         <line/>in some measure for what was to follow. The 
         <line/>lightening appeared to those who were at a dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance, remarkably red, and seemed to flash from 
         <line/>the cloud to the earth and back again, in quick 
         <line/>succession or some time, as to appear one sheet 
         <line/>of flame. This might have had a great effect on 
         <line/>the air, at some miles distance from town, to set 
         <line/>it in rapid motion, especially when pressed down 
         <line/>by a heavy cloud suddenly falling towards the 
         <line/>earth. A very considerable quantity of hail fell; 
         <line/>and the rain was so abundant that it seemed as 
         <line/>thrown from buckets, and being carried along 
         <line/>and dashed against every opposing object by a 
         <line/>most impetuous wind, darkened the air in such a 
         <line/>manner, that all surrounding objects seemed lost 
         <line/>in night. The storm threatened to lay the whole 
         <line/>town in ruins, with such irresistible force did the 
         <line/>column of air move on: happily however, the da<sh/>
         
         <line/>mages were much less than apprehended. The 
         <line/> The new brick house belonging to the Rev. Dr. Da<sh/>
         
         <line/>vidson, being an an elevated spot near the west 
         <line/>end of the town, and lying directly in the line of 
         <line/>march of this powerful column, was the first suf<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferer; all the parts of the building above the square 
         <line/>were suddenly borne off, and a great part of the 
         <line/>roof was carried over Mr. Paton's house, which 
         <line/>stood at a small distance on the east, striking it 
         <line/>forcibly, and injuring it greatly in its ways, and 
         <line/>fell on the adjoining lot. Mr. Paton's house is 
         <line/>left in much the same condition as the Doctor's. 
         <line/>After injruing some smaller buildings in its course 
         <line/>to the eastward, the next elevated object to which 
         <line/>it pointed its fury, was the presbyterian church 
         <line/>in the certain of town–a building of uncom<sh/>
         
         <line/>mon solidity, calculated, it was thought, to stand 
         <line/>for ages, admist all the war of the elements. A<sh/>
         
         <line/>bout a fourth part, however of the roof of the 
         <line/>north side was carried off, with the weighty cor<sh/>
         
         <line/>nice, and thrown to the ground at some hundred 
         <line/>yards distance on the east side of the open square 
         <line/>which is in the centre of this borough. After 
         <line/>leaving the town it beat its course to the public 
         <line/>buildings, and greatly injured that range nearest 
         <line/>the town. Many fences in the neighbourhood, 
         <line/>which were in the line of its direction, were also 
         <line/>thrown down; but how far it extended, or what 
         <line/>damages the farmers may have sustained we have 
         <line/>not yet learned. Let it, however, not be forgot<sh/>
         
         <line/>ten, that dreadful as the scene was, through the 
         <line/>good providence of God, not a single life was 
         <line/>lost or any personal injury, worth mentioning, 
         <column/>
         <line/>received, and the buildings, it is hoped, will soon 
         <line/>be restored to as good a state as they were in be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore.

         <line/>By a gentleman who arrived in this city on 
         <line/>Friday last from the county of Ontario in the 
         <line/>Genesee county (the territory lately ceded by this 
         <line/>state to the commonwealth of Massachusetts) we

         <line/>county, Colonel Brant from Niagara, at the 
         <line/>head of between 16 and 1800 of the principal 
         <line/> Sachems, and other Indians of the Six Nations, 
         <line/>had arrived at Conadoque, the seat of Oliver 
         <line/>Phelps, Esq; on a visit of friendship, and at the 
         <line/>same time to receive the money due them for the 
         <line/>lands sold to the company of Messrs. Gorham and 
         <line/>Phelps–That they were met by Mr. Phelps 
         <line/>and the principal inhabitants of Conadoque, four 
         <line/>miles from that place, and conducted into town 
         <line/>–That they were highly gratified with the treat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment they received, and with the manner in which 
         <line/>they had disposed of their lands.–The gentle<sh/>

         <line/>We have been favoured by a friend with the 
         <line/>following extract of a letter from Grenada, by 
         <line/>the last West India Packet. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A Mr. C— has just arrive here from 
         <line/>Martinico, where he left the white inhabitants in 
         <line/>arms. The negroes there had conceived an idea, 
         <line/>that the Parliament of England had set the Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>lish negroes free ; where upon those on several of 
         <line/>the most considerable estates assembled together 
         <line/>to the amount of 4000, and retired to the moun<sh/>
         
         <line/>tains, declaring, they would no longer be slaves ; 
         <line/>saying, that they had as good a right to be free, 
         <line/>as the negroes in the English islands. What has 
         <line/>been the event is unknown ; but some reports say 
         <line/>that they had arms, and had resisted the military 
         <line/>and the militia ; and that 400 had been taken 
         <line/>and condemned to die. It is a little singular that 
         <line/>such an alarming spirit of discontent should first

         <line/>"It is with great concern I communicate to 
         <line/>you the following truly melancholy intelligence: 
         <line/>–About three weeks ago, Mr. Richard Cheno<sh/>
         
         <line/>weth, had six or eight men allowed him, by the 
         <line/>officer of the garrison at the Falls, to guard his 
         <line/>exposed plantation, in Bear Crab Settlement, be<sh/>
         
         <line/>low the Falls. In the evening of their arrival, 
         <line/>before they had taken their station as a guard, 
         <line/>a number of Indians rushed into Mr. Chenoweth's 
         <line/>house, killed two of the soldiers, and three of Mr. 
         <line/>Chenoweth's children, and tomahawked and scalp<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed his wife, leaving her on the floor for dead– 
         <line/>Mr. Chenoweth, (who had his arm broke by the 
         <line/>savages) with the rest of the men, made their 
         <line/>escape.–There was one of Mr. Chenoweth's 
         <line/>children sick, in a chamber, and, it is reported, 
         <line/>she never heard any thing of the dreadful massacre; 
         <line/>but, next morning, crawling down stairs, she was 
         <line/>inexpressibly shocked at the sight of a beloved pa<sh/>
         
         <line/>rent almost breathless–Mr. Chenoweth returned 
         <line/>next day to his house, and carried his wife to a 
         <line/>neighbouring plantation, where they are both 
         <line/>likely to recover, and, what is remarkable, she 
         <line/>wants to return to her own house.–The savages 
         <line/>have been very troublesome in this neighbourhood. 
         <line/>–A small company are gone to White River, to 
         <line/>extirpate 80 or 90 Indians, who, as spies have in<sh/>
         
         <line/>formed, have upwards of 300 horses, &amp;c. at that 
         <line/>place."/&gt;

            Baker's-row, Mile<sh/>
         
         <line/>end, received the following letter from a friend 
         <line/>in Holland last week: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Sir, your friend L–y, who is just come here 
         <line/>from the East Indies, desires me to inform you, 
         <line/>that your unfortunate relation who left you with 
         <line/>the transports for Botany Bay, was well in Fe<sh/>
         
         <line/>bruary last. He has settled at Port Jackson, and 
         <line/>has leave to teach the children of some of your 
         <line/>nation to read and write in your own way. The 
         <line/>place is much improved since you ahve had any 
         <line/>letters form it, as there was no person without a 
         <line/>habitation, and being in some order, when he 
         <line/>left it. Except wearing apparel, very little is 
         <line/>wanting but business ; but you may thank the 
         <line/>Dutch at Batavia for it, as they have brought 
         <line/>several useful things there. The last crops of 
         <line/>corn, and the garden grounds, were in very good 
         <line/>condition : and what makes the settlement more 
         <line/>convenient, one of the people who came in the 
         <line/>first fleet makes all forts of earthn ware for use 
         <line/>and ornament, as the clay is equally good as that 
         <line/>of Delft or elsewhere. He was surprised to see 
         <line/>so many people without hats or shoes, and houses 
         <line/>without windows, and full of wicker and rush 
         <line/>furniture, which is used in th eplace of almost

            <small_caps>BOUT</small_caps> two month ago I went to the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try to pay a visit to a friend in a remote 
         <line/>county; and though I am much of what may be called "a <i> newspaper man</i>," I never
            thought of or<sh/>
         
         <line/>dering my papers to be sent down to me. To 
         <line/>my utter astonishment, my <i>rustic</i> landlord did 
         <line/>not take in own newspaper; so there was I, stuck 
         <line/>down, with my friend in the country–knowing 
         <line/>no more of what passed in town than if I had 
         <line/>been in <i>Lapland</i>. Intending every day should be 
         <line/>my last, I went on without ordering your, or any 
         <line/>other paper, till two months had passed away, at 
         <line/>which period I returned to town. And there, 
         <line/>Sir, I was quite a new man, and just as if I had 
         <line/>dropped down from the clouds. Every day I 
         <line/>heard people talking of occurrences of which I 
         <line/>knew nothing : Revolutions in France by <i>Fish</i>
            <sh/>
         
         <line/>
            <i>women</i> ; and battles in Flanders, against the 
         <line/>Emperor, who I thought was fighting against 
         <line/>the Turks. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>But even this was not the most distressing–for 
         <line/>one day meeting a friend, I inquired very cor<sh/>
         
         <line/>dially after his wife, who I found a few days af<sh/>
         
         <line/>terwards, had eloped just before with another 
         <line/>gentleman ; and meeting with a lady, I inquir<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed kindly for her sister, who I found had depart<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to the other world a fortnight before. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On this account I never will stir again "out of 
         <line/>the world" unless your paper goes along with me. I 
         <line/>hold a newspaper to be a kind of <i>viaticum</i> with 
         <line/>which every man should be provided, and which be<sh/>
         
         <line/>come the more necessary the further we remove 
         <line/>from town It. is the only way to keep pace with 
         <line/>what is going on every day in the fashionable or 
         <line/>literary world–and to prevent talking about dead 
         <line/>friends, or wives that have absconded. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In short, Sir, a newspaper is my <i>creed</i>–and ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>ver will I again travel without my faith along with 
         <line/>me : having fully experienced the unpleasantness 
         <line/>of being sent back into the world as ignorant as 
         <line/>if I had been born again–<i>I hereby give notice</i>– 
         <line/>"That if an <i>hottentot</i> friend of mine invites me, 
         <line/>who does not take in your paper or some other– 
         <line/>I will not visit him."<small_caps><author name="Dick Desperate"

            <enlarged_capital>I</enlarged_capital>N the United States of America there are some 
         <line/>Jews, and various denomications of Christians, 
         <line/>–as Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, 
         <line/>Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, Dunkers, 
         <line/>Moravians, Deists, Methodists, Newlights, San<sh/>
         
         <line/>dimanians, Universalists, and Shaking Quakers; 
         <line/>all of whom are allowed to perform religious wor<sh/>
         
         <line/>ship accoridng to the dictates of their consciences. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Shaking Quakers are a new sects, that 
         <line/>sprang up about the year 1769 : an old woman 
         <line/>called the Elect Lady, with twelve disciples, all 
         <line/>of which were said to be Europeans, were the 
         <line/>founders of this new mode of worship ; they drew 
         <line/>thousands of people after them, who pretended 
         <line/>they were visited with power from on high to 
         <line/>work miracles, heal the sick, raise the dead, cast 
         <line/>out devils, and speak in unknown languages. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This Lady risided in the north-westerly part 
         <line/>of the State of New York, where she began to 
         <line/>instil her tenets into some of the people there:– 
         <line/>afterwards she rambled from place to place, pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>mulgating her religion, and gaining proselytes in 
         <line/>New England, and elsewhere:–she engrossed the 
         <line/>kingdom of heaven to herself and followers, to 
         <line/>the seculsion of all others. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>She pretended her mission was immediately from 
         <line/>heaven;–that she travelled in pain for her elect, 
         <line/>–could speak in seventry-two unknown languages, 
         <line/>in which she conversed with those that had de<sh/>
         
         <line/>parted this life,–that there had not been a true 
         <line/>church upon earth since the days of the Apostles, 
         <line/>until her's was erected,–that both the living and 
         <line/>the dead must be saved, in, by, and through her 
         <line/>–must confess their sins unto her, and procure 
         <line/>her parson, or they could not be saved;–that 
         <line/>that she gathered her church from both earth and 
         <line/>hell, as every person that had died since the time 
         <line/>of the Apostles, until her church was set up, was 
         <line/>damned, and that they were ocntinually making 
         <line/>intercession to her for salvation, which was the 
         <line/>occasion of her talking to them in those unknown 
         <line/>tongues. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Those that entered into her church were ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>liged to confess their sins, and deliver up their 
         <line/>jewels, rings, necklaces, buckles, watches, &amp;c. to 
         <line/>be disposed of as she thought fit. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It has been reported that some of these confes<sh/>
         
         <line/>sions proved very beneficial; for some of her 
         <line/>church members owned they had stolen things that 
         <line/>had been laid to innocent persons. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>When these people carry on their worship, they 
         <line/>pretend to praise the Lord by singing, dancing, 
         <line/>jumping, turning round, falling down, tumbling, 
         <line/>&amp;c. and in the mean time some will be trembling, 
         <line/>groaning, sighing, and sobbing: whilst others are 
         <line/>preaching, praying, exhorting, &amp;c. others will be 
         <line/>clapping their hands, shouting, hallowing, scream<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, and making such a hideous noise, that it 
         <line/>may be heard at a great distance, and will often 
         <line/>affrighten the spectators. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They often dance three hours without inter<sh/>
         
         <line/>mission, and when any of them are tired of prais<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the Lord that way, they are whipped by o<sh/>
         
         <line/>thers, to make the worship go on briskly. 
         <column/>
         <line/>They dance till they are much emaciated ; the 
         <line/>young women grow pale, appear like ghosts or 
         <line/>apparitions, or like deserters from a church-yard, 
         <line/>–if I may use the sailor's phrase. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They make no use of the Eucharist, or of wa<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter baptism in their churchs; are averse to wars, 
         <line/>fighting, and swearing ; they use the plain lan<sh/>
         
         <line/>guage, and cry–<i>yea</i>, and <i>nay</i>, instead of <i>yes</i> and 
         <line/>
            <i>no</i>: but the other Quakers do not approve of all 
         <line/>their tenets. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At particular times they labour very hard at 
         <line/>their respective occupations, and are very careful 
         <line/>that no time is spent in idleness. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They pretend they hold a correspondence with 
         <line/>the saints and angels, and that they frequently 
         <line/>see and converse with the spirits of their departed 
         <line/>friends. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Many of them refuse to be with their wives, 
         <line/>because they suppose they are part of the hundred 
         <line/>and forty and four thousand mentioned in the 
         <line/>Revelations that were redeemed from the earth, 
         <line/>and were not defiled with women. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They hold, that they have already been made 
         <line/>partakers of the first resurrection, and that on 
         <line/>them the second death will have no power. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They do not allows the instrumental music in 
         <line/>their churches, because they suppose it was cere<sh/>
         
         <line/>monial, and is abolished;–but pretend that they 
         <line/>carry on their worship by the immediate power 
         <line/>and influence of the Holy Ghost, and that they 
         <line/>have scripture warrents for their practice, a[?]– 
         <line/>Sing unto God,–Praise the Lord in the dance; 
         <line/>–O clap your hands, all ye people;–Shout on 
         <line/>to God;–Make a joyful noise;–Fall down be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore the Lords,&amp;c.

         <line/>The disturbances in this island are so far from 
         <line/>having abated, that they seem daily to gain ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>ditional force. The French General, after the 
         <line/>and endeavoured to bring over a part of the mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>litary to his side, against the people : He began 
         <line/>with subalterns, several of whom took a cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain oath of attachment which he administered to 
         <line/>them ; but when he came to the Major, that of<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficer declined, saying he had already engaged 
         <line/>himself on the <i>side of the people</i>. Incensed at this 
         <line/>reply, he reviled him in very opprobrious terms, 
         <line/>and at last laid his cane upon him ! 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Frustrated in his attempts upon the infantry, 
         <line/>he made his next application to the regiment of 
         <line/>artillery, but with as little success. They inform<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed him, that themselves and Culverins were sta<sh/>
         
         <line/>tioned there for the protection of the <i>people</i>, and 
         <line/> for <i>them</i> only should be used. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Driven to the last shift, his distress suggested

            <sh/>
         
         <line/>
            <i>ple</i> of <i>colour</i>, who <i>here</i> form a considerable corps. 
         <line/>By a small dose of flattery these people, so rea<sh/>
         
         <line/>dily to be caught by a little seeming attention, 
         <line/>promised to stand by him ; and did so, as long 
         <line/>as they usually stand firm to any thing–that is, till 
         <line/>their fears for their own persons became an ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject of more weighty concern–they then aban<sh/>
         
         <line/>doned him.

         <line/>The humiliating familiarities to which he de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scended to this motley rabble, were truly disgust<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing. He embraced them; called them his <i>enfans</i>
         
         <line/>and <i>cher amis</i>, and practised all the dirty conde<sh/>
         
         <line/>scensions, which those only who are conversant in 
         <line/>the praise-worthy art of cajoling, can form any 
         <line/>conception of. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The effect of this conduct was, as might be ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pected, insolence–one of this banditti presumed 
         <line/>to strike a grenadier–this incensed both the mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>litary and the peopl–the consequence was, their 
         <line/>doughty leader was laid hold of, when his trusty 
         <line/>defenders left him to his fate. He wa sput into 
         <line/>confinement, and had the pleasure of beholding 
         <line/>from the windows of his prison, him whom he had 
         <line/>inspired with the insolent temerity to strike 
         <line/>White, suspended on a gibbet. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The inhabitants of St. Pierre then assembled 
         <line/>to confer on the measures to be taken on this oc<sh/>
         
         <line/>casion, when ten deputies were chosen to bring 
         <line/>the deposed Commander to that part of the island 
         <line/>for trial, and twelve Judges were chosen to pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>side at that very important tribunal. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Thus stood matters on Thursday last, at which 
         <line/>time a rumour prevailed that the Marquis de 
         <line/>Bouillee had suffered death by the extraordinary 
         <line/>and ingenious method of being put between two 
         <line/>planks and severed in pieces by a cross-cut saw.

         <line/>"Congress is still sitting at New York, and 
         <line/>from the multiplicity of business before them, 
         <line/>there is no likelihood of the session's soon closing. 
         <line/>We are curious to know what foreigners will say 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>of our new commercial arrangements. Among 
         <line/>ourselves there is but one opinion, and that is fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>avourable. o our own vessels, a preference is 
         <line/>undoubtedly due; and among foreign vessels and 
         <line/>merchandise, there is no discrimination in our 
         <line/>import and tonnage acts, every nation being on 
         <line/>the same footing. With respect to the duties 
         <line/>themselves, they could not be laid lower, consi<sh/>
         
         <line/>dering the demand of supplies, which the Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mittee appointed to give in an estimate state at 
         <line/>upwards of eight millions of dollars. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Accustomed to disappointment in hopes of 
         <line/>improvement in politics and commerce, we 
         <line/>feel a reluctance to entertaining very sanguine 
         <line/>wishes. Yet appearances encourage the expect<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of the fœderal government's acting with the 
         <line/>energy and effect that will give it respectability. 
         <line/>The prejudices and animosities created by the 
         <line/>late contest are gradually dying away ; and to 
         <line/>the idleness and dissipation flowing from the same 
         <line/>source, industry has in a great degree succeeded. 
         <line/>A progress has also been made in manufactures 
         <line/>of various kinds that was not expected ; and the 
         <line/>persevering in them affords a strong presumption 
         <line/>of those concerned deriving advantage. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Throughout the union, the public opinion 
         <line/>on matters of government has of late experien<sh/>
         
         <line/>ced rapid changes. Vice President Adams, in 
         <line/>his highly esteemed work, has fully demonstrated 
         <line/>the absurdity of democracy, and the superior ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>cellence of a mix form, such as that of Britain. 
         <line/>His deductions from premises admitted as just, 
         <line/>have abated much of the popular aversion to mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>narchy ; and as every thing matures quickly in 
         <line/>our transatlantic soil, it would not surprise many, 
         <line/>were United America to have a sovereign ear<sh/>
         
         <line/>in the next century. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"In no one instance has our new admnistra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion given general satisfaction, more than in their 
         <line/>conduct towards the Indians. The interests of 
         <line/>those unfortunate people will be studiously attend<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to ; and they will be effectually protected a<sh/>
         
         <line/>gainst the lawless violence of the individuals or 
         <line/>States, who wished to wrest their lands from them. 
         <line/>This determination is dictated by policy as well 
         <line/>humanity ; for it is now become the interest of 
         <line/>the States to check, by every means short of 
         <line/>violence, the erratic disposition of their citizens, 
         <line/>who, when removed to the wilds beyond the

         <line/>Governor Philips describes Port Jackson, which 
         <line/>is only about nine miles to the Northward of 
         <line/>Botany Bay in South Wales, on the Coast of 
         <line/>Holland, as one of the finest harbours in the 
         <line/>world, in which 1000 sail of the line might ride 
         <line/>in perfect security. Sydney cove, named so in 
         <line/> honour of Lord Sydney, the Governor chose in 
         <line/>preference, which is about hal a mile in length, 
         <line/>and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance. 
         <line/>HEre was the finest spring water, and ships can 
         <line/>anchor so close in short, that at a very small expence 
         <line/>quays may be constructed, at which the largest 
         <line/>vessels may constantly unload. His meeting with 
         <line/>the natives here was friendly and uninterrupted. 
         <line/>The appearance of the place was picturesque and 
         <line/>pleasing, and it afforded an ample harvest for 
         <line/>botanical acquisitions.

         <line/>The Minister is now said to be employed in 
         <line/>drawing up two plans, which will give rise to 
         <line/>very warm debates in Parliament : one is for set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tling a commercial arrangement between Great 
         <line/>Britain and Ireland ; the other for giving a con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stitution to Canada. In feeling the former, the 
         <line/>Minister will have to contend with strong com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mercial prejudices; in the latter, he will have to 
         <line/>encounter religious principles. The British 
         <line/>settlers in Canada are comparatively few in num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber. The great bulk of the Canadians are the 
         <line/>descendants of French, and are Roman Catho<sh/>
         
         <line/>lics. The former are Protestants. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Fleaury in france, and Walpole in England, 
         <line/>were not fonder of peace than Mr. Pitt. Con<sh/>
         
         <line/>quests may be made by war, but consequence and 
         <line/>wealth can only be obtained by a pacific system, 
         <line/>if the first commercial nation in the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Besides these considerations, the grand secret 
         <line/>has been discovered since the present Minister 
         <line/>came into power, that the best riddance England 
         <line/>ever had, was of her American Colonies ; because 
         <line/>by this means, she becomes thoroughly collected 
         <line/>at home, to oppose every foreign power, without 
         <line/>the expence and blood of supporting the Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>cans, at the same time that they cannot do with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out BRitish manufactures in one line or another. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Thus, they are under the necessity of protect<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing themselves, at the same time, that, like the 
         <line/>rest of Europe, they are obliged to resort to our 
         <line/>superior mercantile market. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Application has been lately made to the Lords 
         <line/>of the Treasury for an order on the Bank to issue 
         <line/>some of the new silver coin, in aid of the pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sent want of silver for circulation, the scarcity 
         <line/>of which is much felt by retail traders in par<sh/>

         <line/>Letters from Jamaica say, that by vessels arri<sh/>
         
         <line/>ved there from Hispaniola, there are advices that 
         <line/>the French inhabitants of that island feel, with 
         <line/>unabating energy, the glorious cause in which 
         <line/>their patriotic countrymen in Old France are em<sh/>
         
         <line/>barked. Men of every class and description wear 
         <line/>the national cockade of blue and white. Their 
         <line/>accounts from France, similar in date and sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>stance to ours, have filled them with the most 
         <line/>lively hopes, and animated them with a spirit of 
         <line/>resistance to the measures of their Government, 
         <line/>as forcible as it was unexpected by those entrust<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with the executive power. At Port au Prince 
         <line/>both the Governor and Intendant have rendered 
         <line/>themselves completely odious, by vain attempts 
         <line/>to counteract an impulse that is irresistible. The 
         <line/>effigy of Mons. Marbois, the latter, has been 
         <line/>hung and burnt; the people loudly insist that 
         <line/>both shall immediately quit the colony, and their 
         <line/>departure is hourly expected. The press, hither<sh/>
         
         <line/>to under the severest restraint, triumphs in its free<sh/>
         
         <line/>dom; and their weekly publications give an ac<sh/>

         <line/>without the smallest reserve.

         <line/>The following phiosophical facts lead us to 
         <line/>presume that the winter now setting in, will prove 
         <line/>a mild one : It has been constantly remarked, that 
         <line/>when this season commences early, and with se<sh/>
         
         <line/>verity, in Newfoundland, and the more northern 
         <line/>part of North America, it becomes extremely ri<sh/>
         
         <line/>gorous, and of a proportionate continuance there. 
         <line/>When, in the above climate, the winters have 
         <line/>been severe, they have invariably been mild with 
         <line/>us, and <i>vice versa</i>. Now, the ships which sailed 
         <line/>from Newfoundland the beginning of October 
         <line/>
            <i>last</i>, saw the hills already covered with snow. 
         <line/>There is still another argument in favour of a mild 
         <line/>winter with us. Previously to the setting in of a 
         <line/>severe one, nature, in her bounty, has been always 
         <line/>observed to have provided an uncommon store of 
         <line/>wild briar fruits, as a nourishment to the smaller 
         <line/>birds, who would otherwise perish, a vast carpet 
         <line/>of snow spreading itself over the ground, so as to 
         <line/>prevent their coming at the worms, &amp;c. on which 
         <line/>they are accustomed to feed. The present sea<sh/>
         
         <line/>son, the store of these wild fruits is extremely mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>derate.

         <line/>By letters from America, dated the 5th ult. 
         <line/>we learn, that wheat is so great a crop all over the 
         <line/>Provinces, that it has fallen at Virginia to [?] a 
         <line/>bushel. At Philadelphia it is 7s. 6d. paper cur<sh/>
         
         <line/>rency, about 3s. 8d. Sterling per bushel;–which 
         <line/>has reduced the price in France in from 48s. to 
         <line/>42s. 2d. and it is 20s. per quarter lower in Hol<sh/>
         
         <line/>land than it was four months ago. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Two ships, laden with American wheat, have 
         <line/>already arrived at Bristol, where the cargoes were 
         <line/>immediately purchased by the dealers. Large 
         <line/>orders are sent to America for wheat, of which 
         <line/>there has been a prodigious crop.

         <line/>"The convicts already arrived at this port 
         <line/>from Newfoundland, are near fourscore in num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber; a few others are expected. These unhap<sh/>
         
         <line/>py wretches are almost destitute of every sort of 
         <line/>covering, and some of them are labouring under 
         <line/>sickness and infirmity. Their story is accurate<sh/>
         
         <line/>as follows: About the middle of last June, 
         <line/>this miserable class of beings, to the amount of 
         <line/>102 men and boys, and twelve women, all of 
         <line/>whom were convicts, were embarked at Dublin, 
         <line/>on board the Duke of Leinster transport, the 
         <line/>owners of which, who are Dublin merchants, 
         <line/>contracted with the Government of Ireland for 
         <line/>carrying the convicts to the North American 
         <line/>States. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"After the ship had been at sea five weeks, 
         <line/>part of which was foul weather, the provision is 
         <line/>said to have fallen short ; the master of the trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>port, Capt. Harrison, accordingly stood in for 
         <line/>Newfoundland and lay-to till night; when he 
         <line/>disembarked at Bull's Bay, and a little distance 
         <line/>from it, with as much secrecy as possible, his des<sh/>
         
         <line/>perate freight. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"To prevent this proceeding being too early 
         <line/>early known, he landed with them provision for the 
         <line/>immediate supply of their wants, and bore away 
         <line/>with a press of sail. The hungry victims lived 
         <line/>for three days in a state of warfare, quarrelling 
         <line/>about their food ; the strongest beat the weak, 
         <line/>and over a cask of rank butter or beef, there 
         <line/>was for a time as severe fighting as if a kingdom 
         <line/>had been at stake. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"They reached the town of St. John's on 
         <line/>the 20th of July ; and exhibited the most appal<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing procession ever seen in that country : the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>habitants had immediate councils; and the mili<sh/>
         
         <line/>tary and navy co-operating, a place of security 
         <line/>was fixed upon at a distance from the town, and 
         <line/>they were lodged ; here under a guard. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Here the Irish howl was nightly sung in full 
         <line/>chorus, and the centinels were frequently fright<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with the noise while on their posts. A battle 
         <line/>or two every half hour kept them festive all day; 
         <line/>and when the provision supplied to them by the 
         <line/>inhabitants was lessening, they broke away, and 
         <line/>laid hold of every thing that was eatable, with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out enquiring whether it had an owner. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Some of these poor wretches were anxious 
         <line/>to be received into the service of the inhabitants 
         <line/>and probably might have reformed, if so fostered. 
         <line/>But all of them have a claim to the charity of 
         <line/>this country for that supply of raiment which is 
         <line/>necessary to guard them against the inclement 
         <line/>weather."/&gt;

               <i>November</i> 12.</dateline> On Thursday last the Viscount de 
         <line/>Ponteves gave a surperb entertainment and <mention keyword="society">ball</mention>
            to 
         <line/>a number of respectable ladies of gentleman of

         <line/>The boats of the fleet, the state yacht and barge, 
         <line/>received the company at Foster's wharf, before 
         <line/>12 o'clock–and on the appearance of the first 
         <line/>boat having ladies on board, a signal gun was fir<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed from l'Illustre, and in an instant the squadron 
         <line/>was beautifully arrayed with the flags of all na<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions. On arriving at the ship, the company 
         <line/>were very politely received by the Viscount, and 
         <line/>conducted to the state room–the marines saluting 
         <line/>as the company passed them. At one o'clock 
         <line/>the whole sat down to a table liberally spread with 
         <line/>a profusion of luxuries and delicacies, in a hall e<sh/>
         
         <line/>rected for the occasion, which was very fancifully 
         <line/>decorated. At the head of the table was a castle 
         <line/>of pastry, having thirteen metal guns, by which 
         <line/>from tubes that communicated through the table, 
         <line/>and the company were saluted with a fœderal dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>charge. On the top of the castle waved a small 
         <line/>white ensign–the device, <i>two hearts</i>–the motto, 
         <line/>"<i>The United hearts of America and France</i>."/&gt;
         <line/>The head of the hall was ornamented with a <i>heart</i>
         
         <line/>pieced with arrows–and in the motton, "<i>Ho</i>
            <sh/>

         <line/>pliment made by the noble Viscount to his fe<sh/>

         <line/>closed before nine o'clock, and on departure, his 
         <line/>Excellency was saluted with thirteen rockets let 
         <line/>off from a boat moored at some distance from the

         <line/>By the last letters from India, we understand 
         <line/>they were going on in the plodding way, with 
         <line/>nothing new or important.–The markets are 
         <line/>overstocked with British goods, so as to enable 
         <line/>our countrymen to supply themselves with most 
         <line/>articles at a cheaper rate than if they were at 
         <line/>home ; the credit of the revenue rather upon the 
         <line/>increase ; Lord Cornwallis is as strict as ever, 
         <line/>who is expected to remain another year among 
         <line/>them, to the no small regret of those who left 
         <line/>England for the sake of Oriental wealth. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our <i>female adventurers</i> have also found it a bad 
         <line/>market ; <i>British beauty</i> never fails of finding its 
         <line/>admirers ; but the late restriction in the East 
         <line/>have rendered <i>wives</i> forbideen fruit, of which

         <line/>I have always remarked that women, in all

         <line/>that they are ever inclined to be gay and cheer<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful, timorous and modest : and that they do not 
         <line/>hesitate, like men, to perform a generous action. 
         <line/>Not haughty, not arrogant, not supercilious, they 
         <line/>are full of courtesy, and fond of society ; more 
         <line/>liable in general to err than man, but in general 
         <line/>also more virtuous, and performing more good 
         <line/>actions than he. To a woman, whether civiliz<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed or savage, I never addressed myself in the lan<sh/>
         
         <line/>guage of decency and friendship, without receiv<sh/>

         <line/>By recent letters from America we learn, that 
         <line/>the Congress of the nited States, after warm de<sh/>
         
         <line/>bates in both Houes, particularly in that of the 
         <line/>Representatives, passed an act for the purpose of 
         <line/>fixing permanently their seat of Government at 
         <line/>German Town in Pennsylvania. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The two new provinces in North America, 
         <line/>Kentucky and Vermont, whose population already 
         <line/>is so very considerable, were formed by the vast 
         <line/>numbers of inhabitants who fled from the destruc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion and ravages of the unhappy contest between 
         <line/>Great Britain and her colonies, and though the 
         <line/>greatest part of them were then deemed loyalists, 
         <line/>yet they have now jooined the American confede<sh/>
         
         <line/>ration. Seated on the banks of the great river 
         <line/>Mississippi, far to the westward of all the other 
         <line/>states, they can either navigate northerly to the 
         <line/>lakes, or southerly to the Spanish settlements on 
         <line/>the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, and carry on a 
         <line/>lucrative trade with the Indians. They are pos<sh/>
         
         <line/>sessed of as fertile a tract of country as any in the 
         <line/>world, the position of which they <missing>???</missing> also
            s<missing>???</missing>d 
         <column/>
         <line/>by navigable rivers to Maryland, Virginia, and 
         <line/>Pennsylvania, and from thence, as their views <missing>???</missing><sh/>
         
         <line/>tend, to every country in Europe. Thus, from 
         <line/>the most distressed situation, to rise to opulence 
         <line/>and independence ina few years, must excite ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>miration. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Agriculture, at present, seems to be the pecu<sh/>
         
         <line/>liar province of American industry, from whence 
         <line/>wealth will flow into every part of that vast coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, as it abounds in large tracts of rich land, 
         <line/>level grounds, with a deep soil, and extended sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>vannahs; while to the northward the fisheries and 
         <line/>shipbuilding amply compensate for the want of 
         <line/>an equal fertility; and though not so abundant 
         <line/>in coin, yet the provinces produce the finest mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>dows, form whence a provision trade will be every 
         <line/>year increasing. The southern countries of Eu<sh/>
         
         <line/>rope, not affording sufficient crops of grain for 
         <line/>the support of their inhabitants, on account of 
         <line/>the remarkable encrease of population, and which 
         <line/>is still augmenting, as arts and manufacturers are 
         <line/>every where extended: America may, therefore, 
         <line/>be deemed, in future, the granary of this quarter 
         <line/>of the globe.

            <enlarged_capital>A</enlarged_capital> Merchant, originally from London, having 
         <line/>acquired a great fortune in this island, con<sh/>
         
         <line/>cluded with himself he could not be happy in the 
         <line/>enjoyment of it, unless[?] he shared[?] it with a wo<sh/>
         
         <line/>man of merit ; and knowing none to his fancy 
         <line/>he resolved to write to a worthy correspondent of 
         <line/>his in London. He know no other [?] than 
         <line/>that he used in his trade ; therefore treating af<sh/>
         
         <line/>fairs of love as he did his business, after giving 
         <line/>his friend in a letter several comissions, and re<sh/>
         
         <line/>serving this for the last, he went on thus : "/&gt;<i>Item[?],</i>
         
         <line/>seeing that I have taken a resolution to marry, 
         <line/>and that I do not find a suitable match for me 
         <line/>here, do not fail to send me by next ship bound 
         <line/>hither, a young woman of the qualifications and 
         <line/>form following: As for a portion I demand none ; 
         <line/>let her be of an honest family ; between 20 and 25 
         <line/>years of age ; of a middle stature, and well pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>portioned ; her face agreeable, her temper mild, 
         <line/>her character blameless, her heatlh good, and her 
         <line/>constitution strong enough to bear the change of 
         <line/>the climate, that there may be no occasion to 
         <line/>look out for a second through lack of the [?] 
         <line/>soon after she comes to hand ; which must be pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vided against as much as possible, considering the 
         <line/>great distance and dangers of the sea. If she 
         <line/>arrives, and conditioned as abovesaid, with the 
         <line/>present letter endorsed by you, or, at least, an at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tested copy thereof, that there may be no mistake 
         <line/>or imposition, I hereby oblige and engage myself

         <line/>at 15 days [?]. In witness [?] [?] I [?] 
         <line/>[?], [?]."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The London correspondent read over and 
         <line/>over the odd article, which put the future [?] 
         <line/>on the same footing with the bales of good he 
         <line/>was to send to his friend ; and after adressing[?] the 
         <line/>prudent exactness of the naturalized Creole, and 
         <line/>his laconic stile, in enumerating the qualifications 
         <line/>he insisted on, he endeavoured to serve him 
         <line/>to his mind ; and after many enquiries, he judged 
         <line/>he had found a lady fit for his purpose, in a 
         <line/>young person of a reputable family, but no for<sh/>
         
         <line/>tune ; of good humour, and of a polite educa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion ; well shaped, and more than tolerably hand<sh/>
         
         <line/>some. He made the proposal to her as his friend has 
         <line/>directed, and the young gentlewoman, who had 
         <line/>no subsistence but from a cross old aunt, who 
         <line/>gave her a great deal of uneasiness, accepted it. 
         <line/>A ship bound for the West Indies was then fitting 
         <line/>out at Bristol ; the gentlewoman went on board 
         <line/>the same, together with the bales of goods, being 
         <line/>well provided with all necessaries, and particularly 
         <line/>with a certificate in due form, and indorsed by 
         <line/>the correspondent. She was also included in the 
         <line/>invoice, the last article of which ran thus : "Item, 
         <line/>a maid of 21 years of age, of the quality, shape 
         <line/>and conditioned as per order ; as appears by the 
         <line/>affadavits and certificates she has to produce."/&gt;
         <line/>Writings, which were thought necessary to so 
         <line/>exact a man as the future husband, were an extract 
         <line/>from the parish register ; a certificate of her cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>racter, signified by the curate ; an attestation of 
         <line/>her neighbours, setting forth that she had for the 
         <line/>space of three years lived with an old aunt who was 
         <line/>intolerably peevish, and that she had not, during 
         <line/>all that time, given her said aunt, the least occasion 
         <line/>of complaint. And li[?]y, the goodness of her 
         <line/>consitution was certified after [?] by 
         <line/>[?] [?]. [?] [?] 
         <line/>departure the London correspondent sent seve<sh/>
         
         <line/>ral letters of advice by other ships to his friend, 
         <line/>whereby he informed him that per such a [?] 
         <line/>he sent him a young woman of such an age, cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>racter, and condition &amp;c. in a word, such [?] 
         <line/>desired to marry. The letters of advice, the 
         <line/>bales, and the gentlewoman came safe to the 
         <line/>port ; and our Creole, who happened to be one[?] 
         <line/>of the foremost on the pier and the lady's landing 
         <line/>was charmed to see a handsome person, who hav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing heard him called by his name, told him, 
         <line/>"Sir, I have a bill of exchange upon you, and you 
         <line/>know that it is not usually for people to carry a 
         <line/>great deal of money about them in such a long 
         <line/>voyage as I have made ; I beg the favour you will 
         <line/>pleased to pay it." At the same time she gave 
         <line/>him his correspondent's letter, on the back of 
         <line/>which was wrote, " The bearer of this is the 
         <line/>spouse you ordered me to send you." Ha, [?]<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] ! said the Creole, I never yet suffered my 
         <line/>bills to be protested, and I swear this shall not be 
         <line/>the first : I shall reckon myself the most fortunate 
         <line/>of all men, if you allow meto discharge it."/&gt;
         <line/>Yes, Sir, replied she, and the more willingly, 
         <line/>since I am apprized of your character. We have 
         <line/>several persons of honour on board, who knew 
         <line/>you very well, and who, during my passage 
         <line/>have answered all the questions I asked them con<sh/>
         
         <line/>cerning you, in so advantageous a manner, that 
         <line/>it has raised in me [?] for you."/&gt;
         <line/>This first interview was in a few days after follow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by the nuptials, which were very magnificent. 
         <line/>The new married couple are satisfied with their 
         <line/>happy union made by [?] of exchange, which 
         <line/>was the most fortunate that had happened in that 
         <line/>island for many years.

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Monday last was married at Stockport, an 
         <line/>inhabitant of Macclesfield, to a female on whom 
         <line/>he had fixed his <i>affections</i>. It is to be observed, 
         <line/>that he did not toil through the tedious forms of 
         <line/>courtship, but at once got a wife, as others some<sh/>
         
         <line/>times get good places, by <i>purchase</i>–and, as we 
         <line/>are informed, the lady was valued at eight guineas 
         <line/>and thirty yards of Irish cloth, at 2s. 6d. per 
         <line/>yard–which property he deposited in exchange 
         <line/>for <i>earthly treasure.</i>–Whether a wife may be 
         <line/>cheap or dear at that price, time will shew. Her 
         <line/>former husband, having seen military service, was 
         <line/>not to be discomposed at <i>trifles</i>, and his <i>philosophy</i>
         
         <line/>probably being strengthened on the occasion, he 
         <line/>attended the happy pair to church, and saw the 
         <line/>marriage ceremony ; after which they spent the 
         <line/>evening at the bridegroom's house, where all was 
         <line/>gaity. The first husband parted with an help<sh/>
         
         <line/>mate had <i>borne his sorrows twelve years ;</i> and 
         <line/>the second husband received a <i>partner of his joys,</i>
         
         <line/>after having buried a former one <i>just a week.</i>

         <line/>for the support of two missionaries to preach the 
         <line/>gospel. The city of <mention city="London" province="England"
               country="United Kingdom">London</mention> were left trustees, 
         <line/>and the management under the trust was, by the 
         <line/>will, committed to the care of the Bishop of Lon<sh/>
         
         <line/>don. The present Bishop instituted this suit, in 
         <line/>which the city, and a great number of other per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons, were parties, for the single, and indeed novel 
         <line/>purpose of knowing, whether (as the teststor had 
         <line/>originally devised the several sums <i>for the use of</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>British subjects, </i>and the Americans having ceased 
         <line/>to be in that situations <i>since </i>their independence), 
         <line/>the annuity ought not to revert to this kingdom, 
         <line/>or to some other of his Majesty's colonies, to be 
         <line/>applied to similar purposes. This being the first 
         <line/>determination of that nature since the American 
         <line/>Revolution, the Lord Chancellor decided it with 
         <line/>that superior dignity of sentiment that always at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tends his decrees. Two phrases are sufficient– 
         <line/>"all charitable devices are to be held sacred– 
         <line/>we cannot rake up the ashes of the dead, in search 
         <line/>of latent intentions. The annuities and arrears 
         <line/>must be paid, and Messrs. Anderson and Gipps, 
         <line/>and likewise the city of London, must be paid 
         <line/>their costs."

         <column/>
         <line/>On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs 
         <line/>visited the Cathedreal of St. Paul's, which they 
         <line/>explain[?] with an equal degree of curiosity and 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>amazement. They were asked whether they 
         <line/>would not attend the evening service, which they 
         <line/>readily complied, and seemed particularly de<sh/>
         
         <line/>lighted with the organ. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer 
         <line/>of 20,000 men, gratitude obliges us to make 
         <line/>them some acknowledgement, whether we accept 
         <line/>their offer or not.–We can very well spare them 
         <line/>the members of the <i>Halter Club</i>,–all our house<sh/>
         
         <line/>breakers, highwaymen, pick pockets, swindlers, 
         <line/>Faro and E O Table keepers,–and all their ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>complices to an amazing number. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Such a collection would be a truly valuable 
         <line/>present.–Among them are found dispersedly all 
         <line/>the qualitities of able Generals,–skilful Financiers, 
         <line/>–able Negotiators, active Citizens,–and men 
         <line/>highly expert at a <i>Coup de Main</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe,–the 
         <line/>Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their 
         <line/>own country enter into a boxing war against their 
         <line/>enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant 
         <line/>success. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Trading Justices and Lawyers they would per<sh/>
         
         <line/>haps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of 
         <line/>most people, that a few thousands of the latter 
         <line/>description of men might be spared.

         <line/>This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; 
         <line/>is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting 
         <line/>the island, and going to Trinidad, taking the ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>groes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual 
         <line/>succours arrive, the colony is utterly ruined. The 
         <line/>greater part of the colonists, this day, assembled 
         <line/>at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers, who were in 
         <line/>the fort of Trinity, with twenty three officers of 
         <line/>the regiment, were glad to make their escape.– 
         <line/>There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon, many 
         <line/>of whom are from Dominica, Guadaloupe, and 
         <line/>other colonies, an supposed to have been sent by 
         <line/>Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard 
         <line/>incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder 
         <line/>will soon be consumed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Municipality of Fort Royal, have been 
         <line/>obliged to promise and sign whatever the insur<sh/>
         
         <line/>gents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers 
         <line/>run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to 
         <line/>give them money.–Imagine, in short, a scene of 
         <line/>confusion and terror, and you will then have some 
         <column/>
         <line/>idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and 
         <line/>Fort Royal. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers, 
         <line/>who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol, Co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonel of the regiment which has been sent here, 
         <line/>together with a company of Chaffeurs, has been 
         <line/>appointed comandant o the NAtional troops. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The women, confident that it is in his power 
         <line/>to re-establish tranquility, prostrate themselves be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore him, strew the ground on which he walks 
         <line/>with flowers, and affectionately embrace him.– 
         <line/>He seems willing to comply with their wishes. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne 
         <line/>guarded by an army of 4000 men, under the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mand of M. Dumoise, appointed by the General. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We are assured, that the insurgents are arming 
         <line/>four privateers with which they mean to attack 
         <line/>Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate 
         <line/>among them, but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.

            <enlarged_capital>I</enlarged_capital>T is our wish, in imitation of other newswrit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ters, to give now and then an account of such 
         <line/>new publications as deserve the attention of the 
         <line/>public; but in a paper, pubished only twice a 
         <line/>week, where so much naturally occurs under the 
         <line/>article of temporary news, it is but seldom we can 
         <line/>find room for this purpose:–when, however, a<sh/>
         
         <line/>ny ting remarkable appears in the literary world, 
         <line/>we never fail to notice it, although it may not be 
         <line/>in our power to give an extensive and critical ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count of its excellencies. We take up the pen 
         <line/>with real pleasure at present to announce the pu<sh/>
         
         <line/>blication of a tragedy, intitled THE INDIANS, the 
         <line/>reputed offspring of a learned Professor in this U<sh/>
         
         <line/>niversity. The great applause with which this 
         <line/>play was received, when performed at Richmond 
         <line/>Theatre, has raised the expectations of those who 
         <line/>were not present at the performance to the high<sh/>
         
         <line/>est pitch; and we think we may take upon our<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves to assert, that upon perusing it, even their 
         <line/>highest expetations will not be disappointed.– 
         <line/>The plot of the piece is taken from a well known 
         <line/>story published at the end of a volum of poems, 
         <line/>written by the same gentleman. In the choice 
         <line/>of a plot, where so many dramatic writers of re<sh/>
         
         <line/>spectable talents have erred, our author is peculiar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly happy. He ha strictly observed the advice of 
         <line/>Horace:

         <column/>
         <line/>It is simple, and yet it does not disgust by an 
         <line/>appearance of nakedness.–It is one, for the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plaints of Maraino, and the return of Oniyo, form 
         <line/>a beginning; the machinations of Yerdal and 
         <line/>Neidan to prevent their meeting a middle; and 
         <line/>defeat of those arts, an end, which combin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed wake up a compleat and connected whole. In 
         <line/>the delineation of character the author has, on al<sh/>
         
         <line/>every occasion, attended to the "<i>quid quemque</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>decent</i>"–there are hoever some few parts, which 
         <line/>the critic halts to consider, but which amidst so 
         <line/>many beauties, he blushes to censure–Some lines, 
         <line/>for instance in the character of Ononthio, do not 
         <line/>strike us at first as strictly natural. Is so much 
         <line/>humanity found inthe breast of an Inan Sachem, 
         <line/>as to prompt him to spare a victim, about to be 
         <line/>destroyed accoridng to the custom of the country; 
         <line/>that victim a captive of war, and not only so, but 
         <line/>a Briton, who has been fighting against his coun-
         <line/>trymen, amongst whom was his only son, whom 
         <line/>he bleived slain? Would he exert himself so much 
         <line/>in favour of a stranger and a foe, at the risk of dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>pleasing the village, and consequently of losing 
         <line/>his power? Or is it likely that he would have 
         <line/>greater influence with the superstitious crowd, 
         <line/>than he, who was deemed of skill to bend to his 
         <line/>purpose the demons that sway the fortune of 
         <line/>mankind?–Another question concenring O<sh/>
         
         <line/>nonthio, and we leave him. Is it consistent with 
         <line/>the phlisophic firmness of the Sachem, so to de<sh/>
         
         <line/>spair on receiving news of his son's death, as to 
         <line/>declare that he should know no comfort, but to 
         <line/>die? or is it consistent with his humanity to leave 
         <line/>Maraino at such a period of distress, when she most 
         <line/>stood in need of his kind offices?–The first, and 
         <line/>best supported character in the piece is that of 
         <line/>Maraino. Her mind seems intended as the seat 
         <line/>of every amiable virtue. Her grateful reverence 
         <line/>of Ononthio, her unaffected piety, and her huma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nity, in intfering to save an unknown captive 
         <line/>from death, are pleasing <missing>???</missing> which give <missing>???</missing>
         
         <line/>an insight into her nature. In the breast of Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>riano every thing is subordinate to her love for 
         <line/>Onaiyo: this leading feature in her caracter is 
         <line/>properly kept in view during the course of the 
         <line/>piece. But even in this master-piece the author, 
         <line/>has, perhaps, once deviated a little from nature. 
         <line/>The sentiments Maraino utters during the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>versation with Sydney, in the fifth act, are rather 
         <line/>those of a Phiosopher and Divine, than a young 
         <line/>creature, the chorus of whole heart are tuned to 
         <line/>the sweetest strains of tenderness and love. Can 
         <line/>she, who had lately discovered a long lost brother, 
         <line/>talk so coldly in his presence; Can she, who had 
         <line/>so lately heard of the safety of an adored-husband, 
         <line/>so entirely banish his imag from her mind, as to 
         <line/>converse on matters so indifferent? Can the gen<sh/>
         
         <line/>tle Maraino become the cold moralist?–With this 
         <line/>one exception, the part of which we are speaking 
         <line/>is finely drawn and highly intersting.–The lan<sh/>
         
         <line/>guage of the piece is every where elegant, and in 
         <line/>many places, where the sentiment requires it, 
         <line/>sublime. The uathor has requently dignified his 
         <line/>verse by the introduction of obsolete words; this 
         <line/>in general produces a good effect–but there is a 
         <line/>danger of using them too often, and of chusing 
         <line/>them too ancient. it is a dangerous and difficult
         <line/>talk where all is so excellent, to refer to any par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticular passage of scene as deserving most notice: 
         <line/>it requires no small degree of taste and judgement. 
         <line/>If there is any preference to be given, it is per<sh/>
         
         <line/>haps to that scene in the 2d act, where Onaiyo 
         <line/>gives an account of the battle at Quebec; and 
         <line/>the scene in the 4th act, where Maraino is prompt<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by Neidan to slay her brother,–who proves 
         <line/>his innocence by the production of her husband's 
         <line/>belt, the sight of which draws an elegant speech 
         <line/>from the enraptured fair. This scene, however, 
         <line/>would be improved did it conclude with some<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing more apt to the joyful moment, than the so<sh/>
         
         <line/>lemn sounds of Ononthio: a speech excellent in 
         <line/>itself, and containing a very fine sentiment, 
         <line/>
            <center>
               <i>Sed nunc non erat his locus.–</i>
            </center>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Upon the whole, the tragedy, upon which we 
         <line/>have, guided by impartiality, spoken so freely, is 
         <line/>in our opinion far superior to most of those plays 
         <line/>which have appeared of late years:–it is devoid 
         <line/>of bombast:–it is nature–and she must inevita<sh/>
         
         <line/>bly please.

         <line/>Advice from Charlestown, South Carolina, 
         <line/>says that the Indians in Washington county com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mit the most horrid depredations and cruelties. 
         <line/>They have set fire to several houses; and a wo<sh/>
         
         <line/>man, who had a sick husband, telling them from 
         <line/>a window, of her calamity, they shot her dead on 
         <line/>the spot, and then set fire to the spot. The sick 
         <line/>man was consequently burnt. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A Colonel Harling has greatly exerted and 
         <line/>distinguished himself in opposing the Indians on 
         <line/>a part of the American frontiers. This gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>man, with two hundred men, even went into the 
         <line/>very heart of an Indian settlement, and defeated 
         <line/>the savages. He then penetrated the country, 
         <line/>destroying all before him, and returned without 
         <line/>the loss of a man. Every possible acknowledge<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment was made of his services and bravery, and 
         <line/>a liberal subscription made for his gallant little 
         <line/>army.

               dates="23 March 1737-31 August 1818">General Sinclair</mention>,
         <line/>had been twice defeated, about the 19th ult. with
         <line/>the loss of from 500 to 600 men, by the <mention keyword="Native Americans"
               >Indians</mention>
         
         <line/>The Indians first attacked a body of 300 horse
         <line/>which they had drawn into a snare, and cut the
         <line/>whole of them off. In a second engagement, they
         <line/>were likewise victorious, having nearly killed as
         <line/>many. On account of which, Sinclair thought
         <line/>proper to retreat; and the last accounts state the
         <line/>Indians having divided themselves into small par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ties, had so harrassed him, that he was obliged to
         <line/>leave the wounded in the field–Sinclair lost his
         <line/>artillery, a cohorn, and grass-hopper. It is said
         <line/>the Indians are very much elated at their success,
         <line/>and that numbers were daily joining them, at
         <line/>their head quarters, about the Maimis towns–
         <line/>One Indian, it is said, killed 30 with his own
         <line/>hand.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The Indians were extremely civil to the
         <line/>traders from <mention city="Detriot" country="United States" province="Michigan"
               >Detriot</mention>, having assisted them, when
         <line/>they knew of the approach of the Americans, to
         <line/>remove their property to safety, except ammuni<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion and arms. These are facts so well ascertain<sh/>

         <line/>of them:
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They may be attended with very serious and
         <line/>important consequences to the province, as I dare
         <line/>say, all will be imputed to the British for supply<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing these Indians with arms and ammunition.–
         <line/>In short, I would not be surprized to hear of an
         <line/>American army raising, to attack this country.
         <line/>* The loss is here specified, but other letters differing
         <line/>in number, we shall only say, the estimate in general
         <line/>does not appear considerable.

         <line/>CAPE OF GOOD HOPE. 
         <line/>The following account of the inhabitants of this 
         <line/>settlement is given by a late traveller. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The education of youth has hitherto been very 
         <line/>much neglected: the government never hit upon any 
         <line/>successful plan for the establishment of public schools; 
         <column/>
         <line/>and the individual had no other ambition but that of 
         <line/>qualifying his sons, by writing and accounts, to be<sh/>
         
         <line/>come servants of the Company. This body of mer<sh/>
         
         <line/>chants had a number of persons in their employ, 
         <line/>who were very ill paid. Their salaries, indeed, were 
         <line/>sufficient to afford them a bare subsistence ; but it ta<sh/>
         
         <line/>citly allowed them to negotiate for themselves: the 
         <line/>consequence of such a conduct was, that each be<sh/>
         
         <line/>came a kind of petty dealer. Each had his little pri<sh/>
         
         <line/>vate shop in some corner of his house. The most pal<sh/>
         
         <line/>try articles were in the list of their commodities for 
         <line/>sale ; and those who ranked high in government, 
         <line/>and assumed a string of full-founding epithets to 
         <line/>their names, felt no sore of indignity in retailing the 
         <line/>produce of their gardens ; not indeed, avowedly, but 
         <line/>through the medium of their slaves. In fact, the minds 
         <line/>of every class, the Governor, the Clergy, the F[?]l, 
         <line/>and the Secretary of the Court of Justice excepted, 
         <line/>were wholly bent on trade. <i>Knopman</i>, or merchant, 
         <line/>was a title that conferred rank at the Cape, to which 
         <line/>the military even aspired. On this subject the ideas 
         <line/>of the Dutch differ widely from those of the Chi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nese, who have degraded the merchant into the 
         <line/>very lowest order of their society. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>That portion of the day, not employed in the 
         <line/>concerns of trade, is usually devoted to the grati<sh/>
         
         <line/>fication of the sensual appetite. Few have any taste 
         <line/>for reading, and none for the cultivation of the fine 
         <line/>arts.–They have no kind of public amusements, 
         <line/>except occasional balls ; nor is there much social 
         <line/>intercourse but by family parties; which usually 
         <line/>consist of card playing or dancing. Money-mat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ters and merchandize engross their whole conver<sh/>
         
         <line/>sation : yet none are opulent, though many in easy 
         <line/>circumstances. There are no beggars in the whole 
         <line/>colony, and but a few who are objects of public cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>rity. The subsistence for these is derived from the 
         <line/>interest of a fund established out of the church su<sh/>
         
         <line/>perfluities, from alms, donations, and collections, 
         <line/>made after divine service, and not from any tax laid 
         <line/>upon the public. Except, indeed, a few colonial 
         <line/>assessments for the repairs of the streets and public 
         <line/>works, the inhabitants of the Cape have little 
         <line/>drawback on their profits, on the produce of their 
         <line/>labour. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It has been the remark of most travellers, that 
         <line/>the ladies of the Cape are pretty, lively, and good 
         <line/>humoured ; possessing little of that phlegmatic tem<sh/>
         
         <line/>per which is a principal trait in the national charac<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter of the Dutch. The difference in the manners 
         <line/>and appearance of the young men and the young 
         <line/>women, in the same family, is inconceivably great. 
         <line/>The former are clumsy in their shape, awkward in 
         <line/>in their carriage, and of an unsocial disposition; 
         <line/>whilst the latter are generally of a small, delicate 
         <line/>form, below the middle size, of easy and unaffected 
         <line/>manners, well dressed, and fond of social intercourse; 
         <line/>an indulgence in which they are seldom restrained 
         <line/>by their parents, and which they as seldom turn to 
         <line/>abuse. They are here indeed less dependent on, 
         <line/>and less subject to, the caprice of parents than else 
         <line/>where. Primogeniture entitles to no advantage; 
         <line/>but all the children, male and female, share alike 
         <line/>in the family property. No parent can disinherit a 
         <line/>child without assigning, on proof, on at least of 
         <line/>the fourteen reasons enumerated in the Justinian 
         <line/>Code. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>By the law of the colony, a community of all 
         <line/>property, both real and personal, is supposed to take 
         <line/>place on the marriage of two person unless the 
         <line/>contrary should be particularly provided against by 
         <line/>solemn contract made before marriage. Where no 
         <line/>such contract exists, the children, on the death of 
         <line/>either parent, are entitled to that half of the joint 
         <line/>property, which was supposed to belong to the de<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceased, and which cannot be withheld on applica<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion after they are come of age. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is but justice to the young females of the Cape 
         <line/>to r emark, that many of them have profited much 
         <line/>more than could be expected from the limited 
         <line/>means of education that the place affords. In the 
         <line/>better families, most of them are taught music, and 
         <line/>some have acquired a tolerable degree of execution. 
         <line/>Many understand the French language, and some 
         <line/>have made great proficiency in the English. They 
         <pg n="4"/>
         <column/>
         <line/>are expert at the needle, and all kinds of lace, knot<sh/>
         
         <line/>ting, and tambour work, and in general make up 
         <line/>their own dresses, following the prevailing fashion 
         <line/>of England brought from time to time by the female 
         <line/>passengers bound to India, from whom they may 
         <line/>be said to 
         <line/>
            <center>"Catch the manners living as they rise"</center>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Neither are the other sex, while boys, deficient 
         <line/>in vivacity or talent ; but, for want of the means of 
         <line/>a proper education, to open their minds, and excite 
         <line/>in them a desire of knowledge, they soon degene<sh/>
         
         <line/>rate into the common routine of eating, smoaking [sic], 
         <line/>and sleeping. Few of the male inhabitants associate 
         <line/>with the English, except such as hold employments 
         <line/>under the Government. This backwardness may 
         <line/>be said to be owing in part to the different habits of 
         <line/>the two nations, and partly, perhaps, to the reluc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance that a vanquished people must always feel in 
         <line/>mixing with their conquerors.

         <line/>the opening of the Congress of the United

            <enlarged_capital>I</enlarged_capital>T is some abatement of the statisfaction, with 
         <line/>which I meet you on the present occasion, 
         <line/>that in felicitating you on a continuance of the 
         <line/>national prosperity, generally, I am not able to 
         <line/>add to it information that the Indian hostitilites, 
         <line/>which have for some time past, distressed our 
         <line/>western frontier, have terminiated: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>You will, I am persuaded, loearn, with no less 
         <line/>concern, than I communicate it, that reiterated 
         <line/>endeavours, towards effecting a pacification, have 
         <line/>hitherto issued only in new and outrageous proofs 
         <line/>of persevering hostility on the part of the tribes 
         <line/>with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire 
         <line/>to procure tranquillity to the frontier–to stop 
         <line/>the further effusion of blood–to arrest the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>gress of expense–to forward the prevalent wish of 
         <line/>the nation, for peace, has led to strenuous efforts, 
         <line/>through various channels, to accomplish these de<sh/>
         
         <line/>sirable purposes:–In making which efforts, I 
         <line/>consulted less my own anticipations of the event, 
         <line/>or the scruples which some considerations were 
         <line/>calculated to inspire, than the wish to find the ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject attainable; to ascertain, unequivocally, that 
         <line/>such is the case. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A detail of the measures which have been pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>sued, and of their consequences, which will be 
         <line/>laid before you, while it will confirm to you the 
         <line/>want of success, thus far, will, I trust, evince 
         <line/>that means, as proper and as efficacious, as could 
         <line/>have been devised have been employed. The 
         <line/>issue of some of them, indeed, is still depending; 
         <line/>but a favorable one, though not to be despaired 
         <line/>of, is not promised by anything that has yet hap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pened. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the course of the attempts, which have been 
         <line/>made some valuable citizens have fallen victims 
         <line/>to their zeal for the public service. A sanction 
         <line/>commonly respected, even among savages, has been 
         <line/>found, in this instance, insufficient to protect 
         <line/>from massacre the emissaries of peace; it will, I 
         <column/>
         <line/>presume, be duly considered whether the occasion 
         <line/>does not call for an exercise of liberality towards 
         <line/>the families of the deceased. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It must add to your concern, to be informed 
         <line/>that besides the continuation of hostile appearances 
         <line/>among the tribes north of the Ohio, some threat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ening symptoms have of late been revived among 
         <line/>some of those south of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A part of the Cherokees, known by the name 
         <line/>of Chickamagas, inhabiting five villages on the 
         <line/>Tennessee River, have long been in the practice of 
         <line/>committing depredations on the neighbouring 
         <line/>settlements. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It was hoped that the treaty of Holston, made 
         <line/>with the Cherokee Nation in July 1791, would 
         <line/>have prevented a repetition of such depredations. 
         <line/>But the event has not answered this hope. The 
         <line/>Chickamagas, aided by some banditti of another 
         <line/>tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated 
         <line/>wanton and unprovoked hostilities, upon the ci<sh/>
         
         <line/>tizens of the United States in that quarter. The 
         <line/>information which has been received on this sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>cautions only have been enjoined and observed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is not understood that any breach of treaty 
         <line/>or aggression whatsoever, on the part of the Uni<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted States or their citizens, is even alleged, as 
         <line/>a pretext for the spirit of hostility in this quarter. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>I have reason to believe, that every practicable 
         <line/>exertion has been made (pursuant to the provision 
         <line/>by law for that purpose) to be prepared for 
         <line/>the alternative of a prosecution of the war, in the 
         <line/>event of a failure of pacific overtures. A large 
         <line/>proportion of the troops authorized to be raised 
         <line/>have been recruited, though the number is still 
         <line/>incomplete, and pains have been taken to disci<sh/>
         
         <line/>pline and put them in condition for the particu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar kind of service to be performed. A delay of 
         <line/>operations (besides being dictated by the measures 
         <line/>which were pursuing towards a pacific termina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of the war) has been in itself deemed prefe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rable to immature efforts. A statement, from the 
         <line/>proper department, with regard to the number 
         <line/> of troops raised, and some other points which 
         <line/>have been suggested, will afford more precise in<sh/>
         
         <line/>formation as a guide to the legislative consultations 
         <line/>and among other things, will enable Congress to 
         <line/>judge whether some additional stimulus to the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>cruiting service may not be advisable. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In looking forward to the future expense of 
         <line/>the operations which may be found inevitable, I 
         <line/>derive consolation from the information I receive 
         <line/>that the product of the revenues for the present 
         <line/>year, is likely to supersede the necessity of addi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tional burthens on the community, for the service 
         <line/>of the ensuing year. This however, will be bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter ascertained in the course of the session; and it 
         <line/>is proper to add, that the information alluded to 
         <line/>proceeds upon the supposition of no material ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tension of the spirit of hostilities. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>I can not dismiss the subject of Indian affairs, 
         <line/>without again recommending to your considera<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion the expediency of more adequate provision 
         <line/>for giving energy to the laws throughout our in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terior frontier; and for restraining the commission 
         <line/>of outrages upon the Indians; without which all 
         <line/>pacific plans must prove nugatory–To enable by 
         <line/>competent rewards, the employment of qualified 
         <line/>and trusty persons to reside among them, as agents, 
         <line/>would also contribute to the preservation of peace 
         <line/>and good neighbourhood. If in addition to these 
         <line/>expedients, an eligible plan could be devised for 
         <line/>promoting civilization among the friendly tribes, 
         <line/>and for carrying on trade with them upon a scale 
         <line/>equal to their wants, and under regulations calcu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lated to protect them from imposition and extor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, its influence in cementing their interest 
         <line/>with ours could not but be considerable. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The prosperous state of our revenue has been 
         <line/>intimated–This would be still more the case, 
         <line/>were it not for the impediments which in some 
         <column/>
         <line/>places continue to embarrass the collection of the 
         <line/>duties on spirits, distilled within the United States. 
         <line/>These impediments have lessened, and are lessened 
         <line/>in local extent; and as applied to the community 
         <line/>at large, the contentment with the law appears 
         <line/>to be progressive. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>But symptoms of increased opposition having 
         <line/>lately manifested themselves in certain quarters, 
         <line/>I judged a special interposition on my part, proper 
         <line/>and advisable, and under this impression have 
         <line/>issued a proclamation warning against all unlaw<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful combinations and proceedings, having for their 
         <line/>object or tending to obstruct the operation of 
         <line/>the law in question, and announcing that all law<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful ways and means would be strictly put in exe<sh/>
         
         <line/>cution for bringing to justice the infractors there<sh/>
         
         <line/>of and securing obedience thereto. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Measures have also been taken for the prosecu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of offenders. And Congress may be assured 
         <line/>that nothing within constitutional and legal limits 
         <line/>which may depend upon me, shall be wanting to as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sert and maintain the just authority of the laws. 
         <line/>In fulfilling this trust, I shall count entirely upon 
         <line/>the full cooperation of the other departments of 
         <line/>the Government and upon the zealous support of 
         <line/>all good citizens. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>I can not forbear to bring again into the view 
         <line/>of the Legislature the subject of a revision of the 
         <line/>judiciary system. A representation from the jud<sh/>
         
         <line/>ges of the supreme court, which will be laid be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore you, points out some of the inconveniences 
         <line/>that are experienced. In the course of the execu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of the laws considerations rise out of the 
         <line/>structure of the system, which in some cases, tend 
         <line/>to relax their efficacy. As connected with this 
         <line/>subject, provisions to facilitate the taking of bail 
         <line/>upon processes out of the courts of the United 
         <line/>States, and a supplementary definition of offenses 
         <line/>against the constitution and laws of the union, and 
         <line/>of the punishment for such offenses will, it is pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sumed, be found worthy of particular attention. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Observations on the value of peace with other 
         <line/>nations are unnecessary. It would be wise, how<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever, by timely provisions to guard against those 
         <line/>acts of our own citizens which might tend to dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>turb it, and to put ourselves in a condition to 
         <line/>give that satisfaction to foreign nations, which we 
         <line/>may sometimes have occasion to require from them. 
         <line/>I particularly recommend to your consideration of 
         <line/>the means of preventing those aggressions by our 
         <line/>citizens on the territory of other nations, and 
         <line/>other infractions of the law of nations, which 
         <line/>furnishes just subject of complaint, might endan<sh/>
         
         <line/>ger our peace with them. And, in general, the 
         <line/>maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign 
         <line/>powers will be presented to your attention by the 
         <line/>expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes 
         <line/>place, if not renewed, at the close of the present 
         <line/>session.

         <line/>In execution of the authority given by the le<sh/>

         <line/>some artists from abroad to aid in the establish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of our mint; others have been employed at 
         <line/>home. Provision has been made of the requisite 
         <line/>buildings, and these are now putting into proper 
         <line/>condition for the purposes of the establishment. 
         <line/>There has also been a small beginning in the coin<sh/>
         
         <line/>age of half dimes, the want of small coins in cir<sh/>

         <line/>The regulation of foreign coins in correspon<sh/>

         <line/>It is represented that some provisions in the

         <line/>this, upon due enquiry, be found to be the fact,

      <p>
         <line/>The adoption of a constitution for the state of 
         <line/>Kentucky, has been notified to me. The legis<sh/>

         <line/>arises from an event interesting to the happiness 
         <line/>of the part of the nation to which it relates, and 
         <line/>conducive to the general order. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is proper likewise to inform you, that since 
         <line/>my last communication on the subject, and in 
         <line/>further execution of the acts, severally making 
         <line/>provision for the public debt, and for the reduc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion thereof, three new loans have been effected, 
         <line/>each for three millions of florins,–one at Ant<sh/>
         
         <line/>werp, at the annual interest of four and one-half 
         <line/>per cent. with an allowance of four per cent. in 
         <line/>lieu of all charges.–The rates of these loans, and 
         <line/>the circumstances under which they have been 
         <line/>made are confirmations of the high state of our 
         <line/>credit abroad. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Among the objects to which these funds have 
         <line/>been directed to be applied, the payment of the 
         <line/>debts due to certain foreign officers, according to 
         <line/>the provision made during the last session, has 
         <line/>been embraced.

            <i>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives</i>,

      <p>
         <line/>I entertain a strong hope, that the state of the

         <line/>enable you to enter upon a systematic and effec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tual arrangement for the regular redemption and 
         <line/>discharge of the public debt, according to the 
         <line/>right which has been reserved to the government 
         <line/>–no measure can be more desirable, whether view<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to 
         <line/>the general sentiment and wish of the nation.

      <p>
         <line/>Provision is likewise requisite for the reimburse<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of the loan which has been made of the

         <line/>tion of the act by which it is incorporated. 
         <line/>In fulfilling the public stipulations, in this particular, 
         <line/>it is expected a valuable saving will be made. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Appropriations for the current service of the en<sh/>
         
         <line/>suing year and for such extraordinaries as may

            <i>Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives</i>,

      <p>
         <line/>I content myself with recalling your attention, 
         <line/>generally to such objects, not particularized in 
         <line/>my present, as have been suggested in my former 
         <line/>communications to you. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Various temporary laws will expire during the 
         <line/>present session. Among these, that which regu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lates trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, 
         <line/>will merit particular notice. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The results of your common deliberations hi<sh/>
         
         <line/>therto will, I trust, be productive of solid and 
         <line/>durable advantages to our constituents; such as, 
         <line/>by conciliating more and more their ultimate suf<sh/>
         
         <line/>frage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their 
         <line/>attachment, upon which, under Divine Providence, 
         <line/>materially depend their union, their safety, and 
         <line/>their happiness.

      <p>
         <line/>Still further to promote and secure these inesti<sh/>

      <p>
         <line/>The following particulars respecting this flou<sh/>
         
         <line/>rishing colony will not be unacceptable to our 
         <line/>readers :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"We are informed by Lieutenant Grant, 
         <line/>who is lately arrived from New South Wales, 
         <line/>of the flourishing state of that colony ; he left 
         <line/>Port Jackson in Novemeber last, when the crops 
         <line/>were very luxuriant and beginning to be cut 
         <line/>down, without having suffered that year from 
         <line/>the floods. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Governor King had opened a communica<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion with Oraheire, for the purpose of supplying 
         <line/>the colony with pork, in which he had been 
         <line/>singularly successful his Majesty's armed ship 
         <line/>Porpoise having made one trip, and the Norfolk 
         <line/>brig having failed on the same employ previous 
         <line/>to Mr Grant's leaving Sydney. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The most friendly understanding exists be<sh/>
         
         <line/>tween the natives of Otaheite and the settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of New South Wales. We are happy to 
         <line/>hear that the latter country is longer in want 
         <line/>of a stape commodity, the article of coals, of an 
         <line/>excellent kind, being found in abundance in 
         <line/>Hunter's River, together with plenty of wood, 
         <line/>well qualified for the masting of shipping. Mr 
         <line/>Grant made his passage to the Cape of Good 
         <line/>Hope, round Cape Horn, in the brig Anna Jo<sh/>
         
         <line/>sepha, loaded with spars for masts, and coals, 
         <line/>which latter sold immediately at the Cape, at 
         <line/>36 rix dollars per ton (nearly 6l. sterling.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Governor King had formed a small settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment at Hunter's River, for the purpose of work<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the coal, which is of the same nature with 
         <line/>that of Newcastle. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Mr Grant entered this river in the Lady 
         <line/>Nelson, in order to obtain the survey of it. He 
         <line/>pentrated in his boats nearly seventy miles up 
         <line/>the same, accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel 
         <line/>Paterson, without being able at that time, to 
         <line/>discover its source. A wood resembling sustic[?[ 
         <line/>had also been found. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Mr Grant in his passage from England to 
         <line/>Port Jackson, in the Lady Nelson, a vessel of 
         <line/>only 60 tons burthen, with three sliding keels, 
         <line/>and built on Captain Schank's construction, was 
         <line/>the first that passed through the straits which se<sh/>
         
         <line/>parate Van Diemens Land from New Holland, 
         <line/>and sailed along a great extent of coast to the 
         <line/>westward of any land before seen by those who 
         <line/>had visited that country, going into no higher 
         <line/>latitude than 39. 30. fourth ; and observes, that 
         <line/>the fourth cape of New Holland lies in 39. 2. 
         <line/>fourth. He found those he sailed along bold, 
         <line/>with very deep water, wherever he attempted to 
         <line/>land ; and, in general, he had, with a very mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>derate offing, from 50 10 45, and 30 fathoms 
         <line/>water, fine land, and sometimes shells. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"By order of Governor King, he returned 
         <line/>into those straits, and obtained the survey of the 
         <line/>coast from Wilson's Promontory to Western 
         <line/>Port, with the survey of that harbour, which is 
         <line/>well sheltered, and capable of containing many 
         <line/>sail of shipping. There is abundance of wood 
         <line/>easily to be got, and plenty of water ; though the 
         <line/>latter is rather difficult to be procured, on ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count of the distance, and from several shoals 
         <line/>lying in the way, which render it necessary to 
         <line/>take advantage of tide. Mr Grant gives a very 
         <line/>favourable report of that part of the country.

         <line/>"<small_caps>Quebec</small_caps>, March 23, 1810.–A number of 
         <line/>leading characters among the Canadians, who were 
         <line/>Members of the House of Assembly (twice dissol<sh/>
         
         <line/>ved for improper conduct) and the proprietor of a 
         <line/>French paper, called <i>La Canadien</i>, have been arrest<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed and thrown into jail, upon a charge of treason<sh/>
         
         <line/>able and seditious practises ; the printing press, types, 
         <line/>&amp;c. also taken possession of. This vigorous mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sure of Sir James Craig, has astonished the Cana<sh/>
         
         <line/>dians not a little, but the consequences will be no 
         <line/>doubt beneficial to the country, as it has crushed a 
         <line/>faction which has for some years been gaining 
         <line/>strength, and acquiring dangerous ingluence over the 
         <line/>minds of the inhabitants, who are without education,

         <line/>those prejudices which the people of this country 
         <line/>naturally have against the British : for, having been 
         <line/>allowed to preserve their language, they are nearly

            <small_caps>Quebec</small_caps>, March 22.–On Sunday afternoon, the 
         <line/>printer of the <i>Canadien</i>, Mr Charles Lafrancois 
         <line/>was arrested and committed to jail, under a warrant 
         <line/>from the Executive Council, on a charge of treason<sh/>
         
         <line/>able practises. On Monday evening, Dr Blanchet 
         <line/>and Mr Bedard, and last evening Mr T. Taschereau, 
         <line/>were also arrested, and committed by the same au<sh/>
         
         <line/>thority on the same charges. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Commander in Chief in Scotland gave an e<sh/>
         
         <line/>legant dinner, at head-quarters, on the 4th curt. to 
         <line/>celebrate the King's birthday-day–at which several of 
         <line/>the Nobility and Gentry, Generals, and Field-Offi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cers of the army, were present. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Among the other accidents that occurred on the 
         <line/>King's birth-day, from the imprudent use of gun<sh/>
         
         <line/>powder, is the death of girl in Richmond Street.– 
         <line/>Her clothes were set fire by a squib, and, al<sh/>
         
         <line/>though immediately taken to the Infirmary, was so 
         <line/>severely burnt, that she died before morning. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A very melancholy accident happened at a place 
         <line/>called the Pease, Berwickshire. As one of the bag<sh/>
         
         <line/>gage carts of the Forfarshire militia was stopping 
         <line/>there, a fine boy about eight years of age, belonging 
         <line/>to Serjeant-Major Nicol, got out of the cart, and 
         <line/>was climbing on the wheel, when the horses sudden<sh/>
         
         <line/>going off, threw him on the ground, and the 
         <line/>wheel passing over his body, crushed him to death. 
         <line/>The unfortunate mother was upon the cart when this 
         <line/>unhappy accident happened. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Thursday night, a spirit shop in Gibson-street, 
         <line/>Glasgow, was broken into and about five pounds 
         <line/>in silver, a seven shilling piece, about eight shillings 
         <line/>of copper, a counterfeit half-guinea, and a poc<sh/>
         
         <line/>ket-book containing some bills and papers carried ; 
         <line/>some partial payments are marked on the bills. The 
         <line/>villians appear to have entered the shop by forcing 
         <line/>up the window shutter with an iron bar, and then 
         <line/>breaking a pane of glass, by which they got the iron 
         <line/>bolts and the window opened. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Sturday last, a porter was killed in the hold 
         <line/>of a vessel in Dundee harbour. He was engaged 
         <line/>unloading coals ; and the rope by which the iron pul<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly was supported, giving way, the measure fell down 
         <line/>upon him, and killed him instantly. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A few days ago, a mason, of the name of Steven<sh/>
         
         <line/>son, was killed by the blowing up of some stones, at 
         <line/>Templeton, in the parish of Auchterhouse. The 
         <line/>match unfortunately communicated too early to the 
         <line/>powder, and the explosion took place before he 
         <line/>could get out of the way. He has left a wife and 
         <line/>two children to lament his loss.

         <line/>Montreal, July 4 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This city has been for a few days past in a state of 
         <line/>agitation occasioned by an event which has taken 
         <line/>place at Pointe Claire ; and as this matter will be 
         <line/>clothed, no doubt, in all the dress of misrepresentata<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion by our neighbouring enemies, from the informa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion they may receive of it, we consider it a dury, we 
         <line/>owe to the community at large in this country, to 
         <line/>state the circumstances as they occurred, in a fair, 
         <line/>open, and candid manner. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>By the late militia law, 2000 young men are to be 
         <line/>drafted from the general militia of the province for 
         <line/>three months to be properly trained, and of course, 
         <line/>a certain proportion of this number is to be furnished 
         <line/>by each particular district. Some those drafted 
         <line/>from the Parish of Pointe Claire refused to march to 
         <line/>Lapraire, for the purpose of joining the divion sta<sh/>
         
         <line/>tioned there ; in consequence of which, Major, Lep<sh/>
         
         <line/>rohon, belonging to this particular battalion, was sent 
         <line/>on Tuesday last, with 22 attendants, to apprehend 
         <line/>these refractory persons as deserters. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They apprehended four with some opposition ; and 
         <line/>on their way to town with them, they were follow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by a considerable number of persons who rescued 
         <line/>one prisoner, and threatened that they would next 
         <line/>day proceed to the depot at Lapraire, and bring 
         <line/>away by force from thence the young men of the 
         <line/>parish, who were there on duty. Accordingly, on 
         <line/>Wednesday, a large body of these people assembled 
         <line/>at La Chine, with the intention of carrying their 
         <line/>threats into execution. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Thomas M'Cord, Esq. one of the Police Magi<sh/>
         
         <line/>strates, about four o'clock in the afternoon, left town, 
         <line/>accompanied by the light infantry of the 49th regi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, and a detachment of the royal artillery, with 
         <line/>two field-pieces, under the command of Major 
         <line/>Plenderleath, and took post on a point opposite to 
         <line/>the insurgents (consisting of about 400 persons, 87 
         <line/>of whom appeared to be armed) and at the distance[?] 
         <line/>of about two acres. Mr M'Cord, with some other 
         <line/>respectable citizens, pointed out the impropriety of 
         <line/>their conduct, and the fate that would unfortunately 
         <line/>await their perseverance ; urging them, by every per<sh/>
         
         <line/>suasion, to disperse and return peaceably to their horses 
         <line/>and obey the law. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>They replied, that they did not consider the mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>litia bill as fully passed–that they were informed it 
         <line/>had not received the Royal sanction ; and that al<sh/>
         
         <line/>though it might have passed the House of Assem<sh/>
         
         <line/>bly, where it originated, it had not obtained the ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>probation of the other branches of the Legislate ; 
         <line/>that the law, if really enacted, had not been proma<sh/>
         
         <line/>gated amongst them, and that they were not properly 
         <line/>made acquainted with it ; as such, they could not 
         <line/>pay obedience to it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Under this false and unfortunate impression, these 
         <line/>deluded people persisted ; but at the same time de<sh/>
         
         <line/>clared, with shouts of <i>Vive le Roi</i> that if the Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment wanted their services at any time, they were 
         <line/>ready, one and all, to come forward with their lives 
         <line/>in the defence of their country, and that they would 
         <line/>prove themselves, in the hour of danger, to be faithful 
         <line/>subjects to a Government to which they were firmly 
         <line/>attached by every principle. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Finding, however, that they still persisted in their 
         <line/>determination on this particular object, Mr M'Cord, 
         <line/>in his Magisterial capacity, read the riot act to them 
         <line/>and ordered them to disperse ; which not being com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plied with, a round shot was fired by the artillery, 
         <line/>but elevated above injury, which was returned by the 
         <line/>insurgents in a spirited fire with ball, deserving of a 
         <line/>better cause. The troops then fired a volley with ball 
         <line/>and grape, but still too much elevated to do any harm 
         <line/>which was also returned by another discharge from 
         <line/>the mob, upon which a few direct shots were fired 
         <line/>at them (it being nearly dark) by the military, which 
         <line/>made them disperse, and one man was found killed 
         <line/>and another wounded, it is feared mortally.

         <line/>York, July, 28. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Yesterday, at an early hour, his Honour, Isaac 
         <line/><author name="Isaac Brock">Brock, Esq.</author> administering the Government of
            Up<sh/>
         
         <line/>per Canada, and Major-General, commanding his 
         <line/>Majesty's forces therein, arrived at this place from 
         <line/>Fort-George, and accompanied by a numerous suite 
         <line/>proceeded to the Government Building at four <small_caps>p.m.</small_caps>
         
         <line/>when he opened the present extra session of the Le<sh/>
         
         <line/>gislature, and delivered the following speech to both 
         <line/>houses :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislature, Council 
         <line/>and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The urgency of the present crisis is the only considera<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion which would have induced me to call you together, at a 
         <line/>time when public as well as private duties elsewhere demand 
         <line/>your care and attention. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"But, Gentlemen, when invaded by an enemy whose 
         <line/>avowed object is the entire conquest of this province, the 
         <line/>voice of loyalty, as well as of interest, calls aloud to every 
         <line/>person, in the sphere in which he is placed, to defend his 
         <line/>country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Our militia have heard that voice and have obeyed it ; 
         <line/>they have evinced, by the promptitude and loyalty of their 
         <line/>conduct, that they are worthy of the King whom they serve 
         <line/>and of the constitution which they enjoy ; and it affords me 
         <line/>particulary satisfaction, that, while I address you as Legisla<sh/>
         
         <line/>tors, I speak to mean who, in the day of danger, will be 
         <line/>ready to assist, not only with their counsels, but with their 
         <line/>arms. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"We look, Gentlemen, to our militia, as well as to the 
         <line/>regular forces, for our protection ; but I should be wanting to 
         <line/>that important trust committed to my care, if I attempted to 
         <line/>conceal (what experience, the great instructor of mankind, 
         <line/>especially of legislators, has discovered) that amendment 
         <line/>in our militia laws is necessary to render them efficient. It is 
         <line/>for you to consider what further improvements they still may 
         <line/>require. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Honourable Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, 
         <line/>and Gentlemen of the House of Assembly, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"From the history and experience of our mother country, 
         <line/>we learn, that in times of actual invasion or interal commo<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion the ordinary course of criminal laws has been found in 
         <line/>adequate to secure his Majesty's Government from private 
         <line/>treachery, as well as from open disaffection ; and that at such 
         <line/>times its Legislature has found it expedient to enact laws re<sh/>
         
         <line/>straining, for a limited period, the liberty of individuals, in 
         <line/>many cases where it would be dangerous to expose the parti<sh/>
         
         <line/>culars of the charge ; and although the actual invasion of the 
         <line/>province might justify me in the exercise of the full power re<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed in me on such an emergency, yet it will be more agree<sh/>
         
         <line/>able to me to receive the sanction of the Houses. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A few traitors have already joined the enemy–have been 
         <line/>suffered to come into the country with impunity–and have 
         <line/>been harboured and concealed in the interior ; yet the general 
         <line/>spirit of loyalty which appears to pervade the inhabitants of 
         <line/>this province, is such as to authorise a just expectation that 
         <line/>their efforts to mislead and deceive will be unavailing– 
         <line/>The disaffected, I am convinced, are few–To protect and 
         <line/>defend the loyal inhabitants from the machinations, is an ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject worthy of your most serious deliberations."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The speech concludes with a call for supplies. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Proclamation</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The unprovoked declaration of war by the United 
         <line/>States of America, against the united kingdom of 
         <line/>Great Britain and Ireland, and its dependencies, has 
         <line/>been followed by the actual invasion of this province 
         <line/>in a remote frontier of the western disticts, by a 
         <line/>detachment of the United States. The officer com<sh/>
         
         <line/>manding that detachment has thought proper to in<sh/>
         
         <line/>vite his Majesty's subjects, not merely to a quiet and 
         <line/>unresisting submission, but insults them with a call 
         <line/>to seek voluntarily the protection of his Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Without condescending to repeat the illiberal 
         <line/>epithets bestowed in this appeal of the American 
         <line/>Commander to the people of Upper Canada, on the 
         <line/>administration of his Majesty, every inhabitant of 
         <line/>the province is desired to seek the confutation of 
         <line/>such indecent slander in the review of his own par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticular cirumstances. Where is the Canadian sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject, who can truly affirm to himself that he has 
         <line/>been injured by the Government in his person, his 
         <line/>property, or his liberty? Where is to be found, in 
         <line/>any part of the world, a growth so paid in pros<sh/>
         
         <line/>perity and wealth as this colony exhibits? Settled 
         <line/>not thirty years by a band of veterans, exiled from 
         <line/>their former possessions on account of their loyalty, 
         <line/>not a descendant of these brave people it to be found, 
         <line/>who, under the fostering liberality of their Sovereign, 
         <line/>has not acquired a property and means of enjoyment, 
         <line/>superior to what were possessed by their ancestors. 
         <line/>This unequalled prosperity would not have been at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained by the utmost liberality of the Government, 
         <line/>or the persevering industry of the people, had not 
         <line/>the maritime power of the mother country secured 
         <line/>to its colonists a safe access to every market where 
         <line/>the produce of their labour was in request. The 
         <line/>unavoidable and immediate consequence of a sepa<sh/>
         
         <line/>ration from Great Britain, must be the loss of this 
         <line/>inestimable advantage, and what is offered to you in 
         <line/>exchange? To become a territory of the United 
         <line/>States, and share with them that exclusion from the 
         <line/>ocean which the policy of their Government en<sh/>
         
         <line/>forces ; you are not even flattered with a participa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of their boasted independence ; and it is but 
         <line/>too obvious, that once exchanged from the power<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful protection of the United Kingdom, you must be 
         <line/>re-annexed to the dominion of France, from which 
         <line/>the provinces of Canada were wrested by the arms 
         <line/>of Great Britain at vast expence of blood and 
         <line/>treasure, from no other motive than to relieve her 
         <line/>ungrateful children from the oppression of a cruel 
         <line/>neighbour ; the restitution of Canada to the empire 
         <line/>of France, was the stipulated reward for the aid af<sh/>
         
         <line/>forded to the revolted colonies, now the United 
         <line/>States ; the debt is still due, and there can be no 
         <line/>doubt but the pledge has been renewed as a consi<sh/>
         
         <line/>deration for commercial advantages, or rather for an 
         <line/>expected relaxation in the tyranny of France over 
         <line/>the commercial world. Are you prepared, inhabit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ants of Canada, to become willing subjects, or 
         <line/>rather slaves to the despot who rules the nation of 
         <line/>Europe with a rod of iron? If not, arise in a body, 
         <line/>exert your energies, co-operate cordially with the 
         <line/>King's regular forces, to repel the invader, and do 
         <line/>not give cause to your children, when groaning 
         <line/>under the oppression of a foreign master, to reproach 
         <line/>you with having too easily parted with the richest in<sh/>
         
         <line/>heritance of this earth–a participation in the name, 
         <line/>character, and freedom of Britain. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>[The proclamation concludes with a declaration, 
         <line/>that should the Americans refused quarter in conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of Indians being found in Canadian ranks, 
         <line/>that a severe and rigorous retaliation will take 
         <line/>place.]

      <p>
         <line/>This day at two o'clock, his Excellency the 
         <line/>Governor in Chief went in the usual state to the 
         <line/>Legislative Council Chamder, and being seated on 
         <line/>the Throne, the Gentlemen Usher of the Black 
         <line/>Rod was sent to command the presence of the As<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembly, which being come up, the Honourable

      <p>
         <line/>"May it please your Excellency,

      <p>
         <line/>"His Majesty's faithful subjects, the representatives of

         <line/>loyalty, and the happiness of this province in being connected 
         <line/>with, and powerfully protected by the British nation, are the 
         <line/>basis of their constitution, and the just grounds which gave 
         <line/>rise to the formation of the militia, and the firm determina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to defend this country against the unexpected and unjust

            <small_caps>Extract of a letter from Montreal Sept. 25</small_caps>
         
         <line/>"Our Friend Mr – arrived in town from New 
         <line/>York a few days ago. On his way he passed three 
         <line/>days at Plattsburgh, the head-quarters of the Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>rican army, which, from ocular observation, he states 
         <line/>to consist of 8 or 10,000 men, under the command 
         <line/>of Gneeral Bloomfield, Mooar, and Petit. This 
         <line/>force is composed of 3 or 4000 regulars, about the 
         <line/>same number of militia, and some colunteers from the 
         <line/>southward. The militia is almost all from the state 
         <line/>of New York, for the Yankees still refuse to march. 
         <line/>with this force no doubt is entertained here but they 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>will make an attack ; and if they mean to make it 
         <line/>this season, they must be prompt in their movements, 
         <line/>for the weather is getting cold, and they are not well 
         <line/>clothed or appointed. Mr –, indeed, states 
         <line/>half of them to be without shoes or stockings, 
         <line/>which will never do for a winter campaign in this 
         <line/>country. To repel the threatened attack, we are 
         <line/>making every preparation in our power, and the Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>nadians seem well disposed to secondthe Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. Sir George Prevost has established a cordon, 
         <line/>the left of which is at Chambly, and extending to 
         <line/>Chaneguny[?] ; the main encampment is half way be<sh/>
         
         <line/>tween St John's and La Prairie. Colonel Murray 
         <line/>is at St John's with a battalion ; and the Isle-au<sh/>
         
         <line/> Noix is strongly fortified, with a boom and a chain 
         <line/>secured across the river. This line of defence is 
         <line/>composed of four regiments of the line, and 2000 
         <line/>chained[?] militia, with a corps of about 400 Canadian 
         <line/>voyageurs[?], raised last spring. The Royals, a very 
         <line/>[?] battalion, lately arrived from the West Indies, 
         <line/>are now marching to join the camp. The citizens, 
         <line/>[?] here and at Quebec, mount guard, and do 
         <line/>garrison : indeed there are in this island 
         <line/>(Montreal) five battalions of militia, say 3 to 
         <line/>4000 men, pretty well disciplined, and who on an 
         <line/>alarm could march to this cordon in half a day.– 
         <line/>A new regiment of embodied militia has late<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly been formed by drafts from the different regi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments of inrolled militia in this island, and old Major 
         <line/>Murray is appointed Liuetenant-Colonel. The gen<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlemen of the North-west Company army are forming 
         <line/>a corps of their voyageurs, who will be most useful 
         <line/>troops to act in advance with the Indians. The 
         <line/>number originally proposed was 200, but the men 
         <line/>have come forward so handsomely, that they are to 
         <line/>consist of 500. Mr M'Gillivray is Lieutenant-Co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonel Commandant of this corps, Mr Shaw, Major, 
         <line/>and the other partners of the Company are Captains 
         <line/>and subalterns ; so that the men being commanded 
         <line/>by those whom they have accustomed to obey, may 
         <line/>be considered as already disciplined, at least in point 
         <line/>of subordination. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Sir George confines his operations to mere de<sh/>
         
         <line/>fence. La Motte, with about 70 Indians, advanced 
         <line/>through the woods, about ten days ago, within hear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing of this redoubtable army, and set up a war whoop, 
         <line/>which so completely terrified them that though they 
         <line/>could see no enemy, they lay on their arms for two 
         <line/>two successive nights, in no expectation of an attack–to 
         <line/>prevent which, they cut down their best bridge, and 
         <line/>destroyed all the roads by which I suppose they mean 
         <line/>to invade us. Mr –, who was several days at 
         <line/>their headquarters, and who was offered the rank of 
         <line/>Liutenant-Colonel in the army, has, it is said, pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed to Sir George to destroy their camp with 500 
         <line/>men ; and Sir George is said to have replied, that his 
         <line/>plan was fixed, not to make any attack nor to send a 
         <line/>man across the line. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"This forebearance, which the Yankees impute to 
         <line/>fear or weakness, tends only to increase their insolent 
         <line/>swaggering, and their enmity is to inveterate to be 
         <line/>allayed by any thing but hard knocks."/&gt;

         <line/>"Head-quarters Kingston, Aug. 14. 1813 
         <line/>"By accounts received from his Excellency the 
         <line/>Governor in Chief and Commander of the forces, 
         <line/>from Commodore Sir James Yeo, dated off York, 
         <line/>half-past one P.M. on the 11th instant, the following 
         <line/>particulars have been transmitted of the capture and 
         <line/>loss of the enemy's armed schooners:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"On Thursday evening last, the 10th instant, 
         <line/>the enemy's squadron, under the Command of Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>modore Chauncey, got under weigh from their an<sh/>
         
         <line/>chorage, off the mouth of Niagara River, and, with 
         <line/>a fine breeze from the east, stood towards our fleet, 
         <line/>which were becalmed off the port of Twelve Mile 
         <line/>Creek. At sun-set, a breeze coming off the land, 
         <line/>gave us the wind of the enemy, when our squadron 
         <line/>stood for them, on which immediately bore away 
         <line/>from us under as much sail as their schooners could 
         <line/>carry to keep up with their larger vessels. The enemy's 
         <line/>fleet formed a long. The Pike, Madison, Oneida, 
         <line/>and six schooners (two schooners were placed to 
         <line/>windward for the purpose of raking the masts of our 
         <line/>squadron as it should come up). At eleven the 
         <line/>squadron got within gun-shot of the schooners, 
         <line/>when they opened a brisk fire, and, from their 
         <line/>going so fast, it was more than an hour before the 
         <line/>Wolf, our headmost ship, could pass them ; at 
         <line/>this time the rest of the squadron was two and 
         <line/>three miles astern of the Wolf, and on her coming 
         <line/>up with the Madison and Pike, they put before 
         <line/>the wind and made sail, firing their stern-chasers.– 
         <line/>Sir J. Yeo finding it impossible to get the squa<sh/>
         
         <line/>dron up with the enemy, as the Wolf was the only 
         <line/>ship which could keep up with them, then made 
         <line/>sail between them and the two schooners to wind<sh/>
         
         <line/> ward, which he captured, and which are called 
         <line/>the Julia and Growler, each carrying one long 32<sh/>
         
         <line/> pounder and long 12-pounder, and 40 men.– 
         <line/>Two of the enemy's largest schooners, the Scourge, 
         <line/>of 10, and Hamilton, of nine guns, upset on the 
         <line/>night of the 9th, in carrying sail, and all on board 
         <line/>perished (about 100 in number). By this loss and 
         <line/>capture, the enemy's squadron are reduced to 10 
         <line/>vessels, and our's increased to eight. It is ascer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained that the Pike mounts 28 long 24-pounders, 
         <line/>and 420 men, the Madison 22 long 32 pounders, 
         <line/>and 340 men. Boat loads of troops were taken on 
         <line/>board the enemy's squadron on Monday last, for the 
         <line/>purpose, it is supposed, of repelling the boarders.– 
         <line/>The Wolf has not received any material injury, and 
         <line/>not a person hurt. The prisoners were landed on 
         <line/>the 11th instant, and the Growler's damage repair<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed. She had lost her bowsprit, and was otherwise 
         <line/>cut up.

      <p>
         <line/>"Nothing could exceed the eagerness and enthu<sh/>
         
         <line/>siasm of the officers and men in our squadron for a 
         <line/>close engagement."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>By accounts from the army under Major-General 
         <line/>De Rottenburg, dated the 9th instant, the following 
         <line/>particulars have been received of a bold and success<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful attempt to surprise the American post at Fort 
         <line/>Schlosser. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the night of the 4th instant, a party, consisting 
         <line/>of Volunteer Thompson and six privates of the 49th 
         <line/>regiment, under Ensign Winder, and thirty-four 
         <line/>of the militia, the whole under the command of Lieu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tenant Colonel Clarke, of the Lincoln militia, cros<sh/>
         
         <line/>sed over in boats from Chippawa to Fort Schlosser, 
         <line/>which they reached a little before day-break, and 
         <line/>completely surprised the guard, consisting of two 
         <line/>Lieutenants, one serjeant, and eight privates, whom 
         <line/>they made prisoners, together with three civilians 
         <line/>and three of our own subjects, found in the Fort.– 
         <line/>The party remained in the Fort about one hour, 
         <line/>loading their boats form the public stores and wharf, 
         <line/>and brought with them one brass six-pounder, 57 
         <line/>stand of arms, two and a half kegs of musket ball 
         <line/>cartridges, 6 bulwarks of musket proof curtains for 
         <line/>boats, one gun-boat, two batteaux, 20 barrels of 
         <line/>salt, 17 casks tobacco, eight barrels of pork, and 
         <line/>one barrel of whiskey, with a number of spades, 
         <line/>oars, and axes ; a small party of the enemy had 
         <line/>collected as the last boast pushed off from the shore, 
         <line/>and several shots were fired, but the boats returned 
         <line/>to Chippawa with their prisoners, and the articles 
         <line/>they had captured, without a man being hurt on this 
         <line/>service. Further accounts have also been received 
         <line/>from the army highly creditable to the Indian war<sh/>
         
         <line/>riors serving with it. On the 8th instant, a party 
         <line/>of the King's regiment, and a body of Indian war<sh/>
         
         <line/>riors were sent to endeavour to recover a consider<sh/>
         
         <line/>able quantity of medicines and surgical instruments 
         <line/>which had been buried near the Fort George when 
         <line/>our troops retired from it. A skirmish ensued in 
         <line/>consequence between the Indians and the enemy, 
         <line/>in which the latter lost one officer and 20 men kil<sh/>
         
         <line/>led and 10 taken prisoners–the whole of the medi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cines and instruments were brought off by the party 
         <line/>of the King's; the only loss sustained being three In<sh/>
         
         <line/>dians wounded. Captain Norton led the Indian 
         <line/>warriors with great spirit ; and much credit is due 
         <line/>to Captain Merrit of the Provincial dragoons, for 
         <line/>reconnoitering the spot where the medicines were 
         <line/>deposited, and conducting the party to it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A few nights ago, the barracks at Gravelly Point 
         <line/>burnt by our gun-boats, and more than 100 
         <line/>barrels of pork, flour, and other articles brought

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"An express arrived at Burlington on the 30th 
         <line/>July, with intelligence that the British had left the 
         <line/>Isle au Noix, with a force consisting of the two arm<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed sloops, of 11 guns each, and four gallies, of one 
         <line/>gun each, and 100 batteaux full of men, and had 
         <line/>progressed within one mile of the town. The camp 
         <line/>was instantly alarmed, and the troops under arms, 
         <line/>but no enemy appeared. Next day we learnt that 
         <line/>about 1000 troops, under the command of Colonel 
         <line/>Murray, had landed, and took possession of Platts<sh/>
         
         <line/>burgh without opposition, there being no force to op<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose them except the militia of the town and vicinity, 
         <line/>who being only 400 in number, retreated as the ene<sh/>
         
         <line/>my advanced. The arsenal belonging to the State, 
         <line/>Pike's encampment, barracks at Serenac cantonment[?], 
         <line/>and every building belonging to the United States, 
         <line/>were immediately burnt. The enemy obtained both 
         <line/>provisions and stores. The loss cannot be less than 
         <line/>50,000 dollars. The enemy left Plattsburgh on the 
         <line/>1st, and are understood to be proceeding this way

         <line/>On General Dearborn invading Canada, and tak<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing possession of Fort George, he sent off to Green<sh/>
         
         <line/>bush, as prisoners of war, the following respectable 
         <line/>inhabitants : Messrs Edwards, Murehead, Dickson 
         <line/>Lyminston, Lawe, two Kerrs, M'Ewan, Parson 
         <line/>Addison, Howell, Heron, Green, Baldwin, Clinch 
         <line/>Jones, Ball, Decoe, and John Crook. Messrs 
         <line/>Lawe, M'Ewen and the two Kerrs were wounded 
         <line/>on the 27th June. General Dearborn expected 
         <line/>that the inhabitants would have joined the Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>cans. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>General Dearborn resigned the command of the 
         <line/>Niagara army on the 23th June, on account of in<sh/>
         
         <line/>disposition. General Lewis says, in his dispatch to 
         <line/>Secretary at War, that he did not think the Ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral would ever again be fit for service ; that the 
         <line/>unfortunate events of the war had deranged his un<sh/>
         
         <line/>derstanding ; and that thought sometimes in a state 
         <line/>of convalescence, he uniformly relapsed when mili<sh/>
         
         <line/>tary topics were alluded to. General Lewis having 
         <line/>been nominated to command at Sacket's Har<sh/>
         
         <line/>bour, is succeeded at Fort George, Niagara, and on 
         <line/>the Canadian frontier, by General Boyd.

         <line/>Virginia, for surround Fort Meigs with 2000 
         <line/>warriors. He had deprived the garrison of all the pos<sh/>
         
         <line/>sibility of receiving supplies. General Clay, who 
         <line/>commanded there, had written urgently to General 
         <line/>Harrison for assistance. The latter was collecting

         <line/>Sir James Yeo, after the retreat of the enemy's 
         <line/>army at Fort George, swept the American side of 
         <line/>Lake Ontario. He landed a body of troops at Great 
         <line/>Sodus, and took the whole of the provisions, con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sisting of several hundred barrels of pork and flour, 
         <line/>and burnt the buildings. The British loss was a 
         <line/>serjeant and four privates of the Royal killed. At 
         <line/>Genessee River, he inflicted the same loss on the 
         <line/>enemy, taking 500 barrels of pork and 1700 bushels 
         <line/>of corn. The provisions were delivered to General 
         <line/>Vincent. Four companies of the Royals were em<sh/>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There were at Quebec, on the 22d July, 1000 
         <line/>American prisoners of war, captured since the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mencement of the campaign. At Beaufort there were 
         <line/>50 officers including three General. In consequence

         <line/>of 36 days, papers and letters have been received from 
         <line/>Canada, to the 19th, which contain an amount of an 
         <line/>engagement between a detachment of the British 
         <line/>force under Lieut.-Col. Morrison, consisting of the 
         <line/>49th[?] and 89th regiments, with some companies of 
         <line/>the Canadian militia, and a body of American troops, 
         <line/>amounting to 4000 men, which ended in the defeat 
         <line/>of the latter, with great loss. This action was pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duced by the attempt of the American General to 
         <line/>advance to Montreal, from which it appears, how<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever, he has now begun to measure back his steps, 
         <line/>having crossed to the American side of the river

         <line/>sued in his retreat by the British troops.

         <line/>about 3000 to 4000 infantry, cavalry &amp;c. was alone

         <line/>The following letter received in town, gives a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scription of the wanton and barbarous conduct of the 
         <line/>American army, in destroying a settlement of the 
         <line/>Moravian missionaries, in their late irruption into 
         <line/>province:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Yesterday I received a very afflicting account from North 
         <line/>America, by a letter from New York, dated Dec. 27 1813, 
         <line/>concerning a report of the total destruction of our settlement, 
         <line/>[?] [?] on the 6th of October, by the American 
         <line/>army under General Harrison. It was the consequence of the 
         <line/>invasion[?] of that province, after the capture of the little fleet 
         <line/>on Lake Erle, and the defeat of the s[?]al British force under the 
         <line/>[?] of occupying the Chapel and some other houses for 
         <line/>our[?] sick British soldiers, and considering the danger the Chris<sh/>
         
         <line/>tian Indians were in from the malice of the Americans, it was 
         <line/>his advice, that the Missionaries and the Indian Congregation 
         <line/>should retreat[?] farther into the country. When the Americans 
         <line/>were successful in the latter, it became necessary to take steps 
         <line/>of effect it. The British behaved very kindly to the brethren, 
         <line/>and offered to purchase the houses and cottages, but their de<sh/>
         
         <line/>feat prevented it. On entering the place, the Americans first 
         <line/>pretended to be friendly, and sorry that the Indians had fled, 
         <line/>who had gone with Mr and Mrs Denke (one of the Mission<sh/>
         
         <line/>aries) up the river. Mr and Mrs Schnall, and the aged Mis<sh/>
         
         <line/>sionary, Michael Young, remained. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"During the first night the Americans already changed 
         <line/>their tone, or rather showed their real character. They began 
         <line/>to abuse the Missionaries with curses, and all manner of insults, 
         <line/>plundering the houses ; and General Harrison, to whom we ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pealed, would grant no redress. They took every thing that 
         <line/>was exable[?] away ; and, under a pretence that King's stores 
         <line/>and English goods were lodged in the houses, ransacked every 
         <line/>place, and every trunk and chest belonging to individuals. Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>modore Perry, who had defeated the Mosquito fleet on the 
         <line/>lake, was there, and behaved rather better than the rest, ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vicing the Missionaries to get away as fast as they could. 
         <line/>They did so with difficulty, and shortly after the Americans 
         <line/>set the place on fire, and burnt down the whole, even every 
         <line/>outhouse[?]. The poor Missionaries had a very tedious journey, 
         <line/>and reached Silitiz, a settlement of the Brethren in Pennsyl<sh/>
         
         <line/>vania, December 11. Whither the Christian Indians have fled 
         <line/>is not known ; they had proposed to go to the Grand River, 
         <line/>about 100 miles off.

         <line/>they had armed themselves, and taken the command of a gang 
         <line/>of 26 desperadoes, with whose aid they had committed nume<sh/>

         <line/>Sydney, New South Walves, Jan. 4. 
         <line/>The Argo has arrived with a most extensive supply of tea, 
         <line/>viz, 167 chests of souchong, 200 ditto bobea, 200 hyson skin, 
         <line/>and young hyson 50 ; in all 617 chests. The consequences has 
         <line/>been a reduction in the price of souching from 30s to 5s per 
         <line/>lb currency. Shortly prior to the Argo's departure from the 
         <line/>Island of Mauritius, the Hope American ship, laden with tea 
         <line/>and sundies, valued at L80,000, was captured by his Maje<sh/>
         
         <line/>sty's sloop Harpy, Captain Allen.

      <p>
         <line/>In consequences of the oppressive conduct of several masters 
         <line/>of colonial and British ships, and of their crews towards the 
         <line/>natives of New Zealand, of Otaheite, and of the other islands 
         <line/>in the South Pacific Ocean, which have led to the destruction 
         <line/>of several vessels, with their crews, by the natives, and dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>turbed all trade and intercourse with those islands, both by 
         <line/>British shipping and that ofthe allied powers–his Excellency 
         <line/>has forbidden any vessel to clear out from any place in New 
         <line/>South Wales, without a bond given by the master or owner to 
         <line/>the naval officer for the time being at the port, for L.1000 
         <line/>sterling, binding him and his crew not to commit any act of 
         <line/>hostility, or to be guilty of any trespass, or forment any animo<sh/>
         
         <line/>sities between the natives, or take any part in any war that 
         <line/>may prevail ; nor forcibly carry away any male or female in<sh/>
         
         <line/>habitants of the islands under penalty of forfeiting the sum 
         <line/>specified in the bond. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A small party, who a short time ago undertook[?] a land pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sage in a direction towards Broken Bay, for the purpose of as<sh/>
         
         <line/>certaining the nature and fertility of the country, have disco<sh/>
         
         <line/>vered an excellent grazing track of 8000acres. In consequence 
         <line/>of which one gentlemen, Mr Robert Campbell, has already 
         <line/>sent thither an extensive herd of cattle, and this example is 
         <line/>likely to be followed by others.

         <line/>Thomas West, who came to this colony a convict for life, 
         <line/>in the ship Earl Cornwall's[?], in 1801, has received from his 
         <line/>Excellency a conditional pardon, in consideration of his general 
         <line/>good conduct and character for sobriety and industry, and also 
         <line/>in consideration of his having lately erected a water mill for 
         <line/>the grinding of grain at Barcorn Glen, within two miles of 
         <line/>Sydney, being the first water mill ever erected in the vicinty 
         <line/>of this town.

         <line/>Sydney, New South Wales, May 21. 
         <line/>The good understanding between the natives and our 
         <line/>settlers, which had been maintained for the last six years, 
         <line/>has given place to frequent outrages attended with fatal con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sequences. On Saturday, a body of 60 natives commenced 
         <line/>plundering the fields of a settler, when three privates of the 
         <line/>veteran battalion fired upon them and killed a boy. The na<sh/>
         
         <line/>rushed upon them before they could load again, and 
         <line/>killed on private, Isaac Eustace, and compelled the other 
         <line/>two to fly. They then plundered the ground of Messrs 
         <line/>Milehouse and Butcher. Next day a party of 14 soldiers 
         <line/>falling in with them, shot a woman and two children–the 
         <line/>savages attacked William Baker, a stock-keeper of Mr Mac<sh/>
         
         <line/>Arthur, killed the man and two women, named Sullivan and 
         <line/>Herburg.

         <line/>regiment, commanded by Major Oglivie ; and yesterday ar<sh/>

         <line/>[Extracts of Letters from Quebec and Montreal.] 
         <line/>Quebec, July 15. 
         <line/>The commercial world is flourishing here, but in 
         <line/>political matters, I am sorry to say, we are sadly in 
         <line/>the back ground. The old defensive system is still 
         <line/>adhered to, and, I fear much, with all our reinforce<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments, we shall do little good till we have another 
         <line/>commander in chief. There is now a great body of 
         <line/>regular troops in this country, and a handful of brave 
         <line/>fellows have recently been almost sacrificed <i>par la</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>petite guerre</i> at Chippawa, whilst, in the lower pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vince, there are at least 10,000 regulars doing no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Some of the officers of the regiments lately arriv<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed from France do not conceal their sentiments– 
         <line/>On inspecting one of the regiments the other day, 
         <line/>our chief took occasion, as usual, to make some re<sh/>
         
         <line/>marks on the cut of the men's clothes, when the Co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonel commanding stepped forward and told him 
         <line/>plainly, that such systems were now completely ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ploded–that he had had the honour of ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>ving very lately under a much more celebrated 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>General that it was probable he would ever serve 
         <line/>under again–that his men had been accustomed to 
         <line/>fight, not to dance ; and if such was the plan he was 
         <line/>called on to follow, he should certainly retire from 
         <line/>the service. Such language you may suppose was 
         <line/>not very pleasing to our Governor ; but I am happy 
         <line/>to find that we now have military men amongst us, 
         <line/>who are not afraid to speak out ; as it appears the 
         <line/>numberless representations of civilians are not much 
         <line/>attended to. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Montreal, July 14. 
         <line/>I consider this country now as perfectly secure 
         <line/>against any attempts that the Americans may make, 
         <line/>not withstanding the system of our chief does not 
         <line/>seem to be changed. He has received a great many 
         <line/>more troops this year than he had any idea of, and 
         <line/>does not seem pleased at having so large a force un<sh/>
         
         <line/>his command, as the country will now look to 
         <line/>him for some offensive operation against the enemy. 
         <line/>He has done nothing the whole summer but pa<sh/>
         
         <line/>rade about 6000 men at Chambly, where he makes 
         <line/>them march past him twice a-week, bowing and 
         <line/>scraping, instead of emplying them where they 
         <line/>ought to be. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>You will have heard of an American army of 
         <line/>about 6000, under General Jacob Brown, having 
         <line/>crossed the river at Fort Erie, when General Rial, 
         <line/>with a force of 1500 only, gallantly assailed them 
         <line/>but was overpowered by numbers, and sustained con<sh/>
         
         <line/>siderable loss. I inclose a general order published 
         <line/>yesterday about this unfortunate business, whereby 
         <line/>you will find that our loss has been great. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Upon this frontier the Americans have hardly 
         <line/>any force, and it appears very singular indeed, that 
         <line/>so great a body of men, as are now on the other side 
         <line/>of the river, from Sorel to Isle Aux Noix, at 
         <line/>least 10,000 men, should be left for the purpose of 
         <line/>parade, when they are so much wanted in the upper 
         <line/>province. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>I sincerely hope that some investigation will take 
         <line/>place into this business, as it is really disgraceful to 
         <line/>think that such an enemy should be able to make an 
         <line/>attack upon us with impunity.

         <line/>Quebec, Sept. 10. 
         <line/>The Americans, to the number of 900 men, landed and at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tacked Fort Michillimackinac, in Lake Huron, on the 4th 
         <line/>August. They were repulsed by the British garrison. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The American fort la Prairie du Chiens has been taken 
         <line/>by the British. This place was considered as of great impor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance to the enemy. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Major General Conran, of the Royal, has had the misfor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tune to break his leg, by a fall from his horse. This officer 
         <line/>had just arrived to join the army on the Niagara frontier, 
         <line/>when he met with this accident. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 31st August, the British troops broke their en<sh/>
         
         <line/>campment at Odell Town, near Lake Champlain, and pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceeded immediately to take possession of the position which 
         <line/>the American army had just abandoned at the village of 
         <line/>Champlain. This army was commanded by General Izard, 
         <line/>and are said to have proceeded partly to Plattsburgh, and part<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly to Sackett's Harbour, on Lake Ontario. The British 
         <line/>troops now at Champlain are commanded by Major Gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>rals Brisbane, Power, and Robinson, and consist of the 
         <line/>13th, 49, 88th, Meuron's regiment, Canadian chasseurs, 
         <line/>&amp;c. &amp;c.

         <line/>The 79th[?] or[?] Glasgow Lowland regiment are now quarter<sh/>

         <line/>The 4th[?] battalion of the 1st, or Royal Scots, are station<sh/>

         <line/>The 3rd[?], 104th flank[?] companies, 103d, 8th, or King's, 
         <line/>100th, regiment de Watteville, [?] battalion of 1st, or 
         <line/>Royal Scots, and 41st flank[?] companies are with the army 
         <line/>under Lieutenant General Drummon, on the Niagara fron<sh/>
         
         <line/>tier, Upper Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The 37th and 57th regiments are at Montreal. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 15th of August, the British troops under Lieute<sh/>
         
         <line/>nant General Drummond assaulted Fort Erie. The attack 
         <line/>was made in three columns, under Colonel Scott of the 103d 
         <line/>regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Drummond 104th regiment, and 
         <line/>Lieutenant Colonel Fischer of de Watteville's. The two 
         <line/>former were directed to scale the fort, and the latter to get 
         <line/>possession of a small hill, named Snake-Hill, which the Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>ricans had fortified, and being situated only about eight hun<sh/>
         
         <line/>dred yards from Fort Erie, was of consequence to us. This 
         <line/>latter column failed in their object ; but the two columns des<sh/>
         
         <line/>tined for the fort carried the same in a most gallant manner, 
         <line/>and obliged the enemy to retire into two stone block-houses 
         <line/>inside the fort, when their own guns were turned against 
         <line/>them. At this time a most unfortunate explosion took place, 
         <line/>which blew up the magazine and battery, and with them a 
         <line/>number of our brave soldiers ; and the consternation caused 
         <line/>by this was so great, and we were obliged to abandon our 
         <line/>conquest, and retreat to our original position, with great loss 
         <line/>of both officers and men. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The large ship-building by the British at Kingston, on Lake 
         <line/>Ontario is to be launched the second week in September– 
         <line/>also will carry about 100 guns. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The battalion of royal marines, commanded by Lieutenant<sh/>
         
         <line/> Colonel Williams, and which has been stationed lately at Isle 
         <line/>au Noix, and parts adjacent, have been broken up and distri<sh/>
         
         <line/>buted among the fleets on the Lakes. The Staff of the batta<sh/>

         <line/>Quebec, Sept. 3. 
         <line/>The army from this province has entered the United States 
         <line/>by the Champlain frontier. On the 1st inst. the advance was 
         <line/>at Chazy. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Quebec, Sept. 8. 
         <line/>From the north-western frontier of Upper Canada, Messrs 
         <line/>M'Gillivray and M'Leod, who arrived here on Thursday last, 
         <line/>have brought dispatches from Lieutenant Colonel M'Donal, 
         <line/>at Michillimackinac, written since the repulse of the Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>can forces sent there to recapture it. The following are 
         <line/>the particulars of that expedition :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"On the forenoon of the 5th of August, the Americans 
         <line/>landed 900 men, or thereabouts, at the back of the island 
         <line/>(Dowsman's farm). There is a considerable space of ground 
         <line/>cleared, and a gentle slope, which enabled their vessels, at 
         <line/>anchor close to the beach, to keep clear, by a constant fire of 
         <line/>grape, &amp;c. and which by the situation of the ground, passed 
         <line/>directly over the men's heads, as they formed and advanced 
         <line/>towards the woods. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual[?] formed his small garrison 
         <line/>(150 at most) at the extremity of the woods, and the Indians 
         <line/>were stationed on each flank, to keep the enemy from out<sh/>
         
         <line/>flanking the troops. By a false account of the enemy's inten<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to land on another part of the island, a certain number of 
         <line/>Indians were sent to watch their motions ; but more Indians 
         <line/>absenting themselves, exposed one flank of Lieutenant-Colon<sh/>
         
         <line/>nel M'Doual's party entirely ; and an apprehension was enter<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained that the enemy would outflank and cut off the garrison 
         <line/>from the forts ; it was therefore deemed expedient to fall back 
         <line/>between the two forts, and there await the advance of the 
         <line/>enemy. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A party of between 40 and 50 Indians, placed on the left 
         <line/>flank, and ignorant of the movements in the centre and right 
         <line/>flank, fired on the Americans, and threw them into confusion, 
         <line/>which the Indians soon perceived, and encouraging each other 
         <line/>by whoops and yells, totally broke the little order still observed 
         <line/>by the enemy, who took instant flight, and were all out of 
         <line/>reach before Lieutenant-Colonel M'Doual was apprised of 
         <line/>their retreat. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Thus was a body of at least from six to nine hundred 
         <line/>men defeated and put to instant flight by 40 or 50 Indians, 
         <line/>with a loss of 17 men and a Major (Holmes) killed and found 
         <line/>on the spot!–The Indians lost but one man."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Previous to and combined with this, the measures taken by 
         <line/>the enemy were these: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"On the [?] of July, a detachment of the expedition sent 
         <line/>against Michillimackinac by the enemy, proceeded to St Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>ry's, where they met with no resistance, there being neither 
         <line/>troops nor Indians, and every person occupied about their 
         <line/>usual concerns ; such as bay making, fishing &amp;c. Major 
         <line/>Holmes commanded the party, who gave up to indiscriminate 
         <line/>plunder, and destroyed the whole of the property belonging 
         <line/>to the North West Company ; burning their houses, stores, 
         <line/>and vessels, killing their cattle, and taking off their engagees 
         <line/>prisoners ; tearing down the fences, destroying the gardens, 
         <line/>fields, &amp;c. Many wanton acts of cruelty might be detailed. 
         <line/>Let two suffice for the present. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Mr Johnstone's property was plundered, even his furni<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture ; the very clothing of his wife and children was seized 
         <line/>upon by these ruthless plunderers, and carried away. Major 
         <line/>Holmes sent to the south side of the strait for Mr Johnstone's 
         <line/>son George, and, after threatening and reviling him with the 
         <line/>most oppobrious language, flourished his sword over his head, 
         <line/>and said he had a great mind to cut his head off, now he was 
         <line/>his slave, When they were in the act of burning the houses 
         <line/>and stores, Mr G. Johnstone was ordered to stand in a cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain spot, under pain of being shot ; but had he remained, suf<sh/>
         
         <line/>foration[?] must have been his fate, being so near the buildings 
         <line/>in flames : he therefore risked being shot, and came off, and 
         <line/>thereby effected a timely escape. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Another instance of more than savage cruelty was exer<sh/>
         
         <line/>cised on a poor horse, which they made us of all day in cart<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing their plunder, and in the evening, whilst still tackled to 
         <line/>the cart, tied him to the end of the dwelling-house then in 
         <line/>flames, and amused themselves in looking at the poor animal 
         <line/>making vain efforts to get loose ; but there he was burnt, and 
         <line/>his bones seen there by the writer of this."/&gt;

         <line/>Montreal, Oct. 29 
         <line/>The express from Upper Canada, which arrived 
         <line/>yesterday morning, confirmed the highly satisfactory 
         <line/>reports of the preceding day, that the enemy had 
         <line/>precipitately retreated on the 19th instant, from be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore Chippawa, after destroying a quantity of provi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sions and heavy baggage ; and that, on the 21st, they 
         <line/>had passed over to Buffaloe a great part of their 
         <line/>force, and were blowing up the works at Fort Erie. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Further accounts from Kingston have been receiv<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed this morning to the 26th instant, when the official 
         <line/>report of the enemy's retreat from Fort Erie, after the 
         <line/>destruction of the works, had not reached that place, 
         <line/>but there was no doubt of the fact. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Major-Genera de Watteville commanded the corps 
         <line/>pressing on the enemy ; the master of a mail which 
         <line/>arrived at Kingston on the 25th, in twenty-four hours 
         <line/>from Fort George, further confirms the previous 
         <line/>intelligence, and reports that several hundred prisoners 
         <line/>were taken, before the Americans effected their 
         <line/>escape across the river. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 18th the British came up with his rear 
         <line/>guard, and in a sharp action thirty of the Americans 
         <line/>were left on the field wihtout a casualty happening 
         <line/>on our side. This was at Chippawa Creek.– 
         <line/>The enemy then fled with the utmost precipitation 
         <line/>to Fort Erie, and began the destruction of his for<sh/>
         
         <line/>tifications. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A military courier from Kingston arrived this 
         <line/>morning, brings no additional news of importance.– 
         <line/>Sir James Yeo had returned to Kingston with the 
         <line/>sick of the army of Niagara on board. We again 
         <line/>sailed for the head of the Lake. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A private letter from Niagara of the 10th instant, 
         <line/>says that a severe action took place the day before 
         <line/>near Chippawa ; our loss is stated at 10 killed and 
         <line/>wounded. That of the enemy is supposed to be 
         <line/>very considerable ; a field piece made to bear upon 
         <line/>one of his columns did great execution. Another 
         <line/>letter denies any loss in killed but makes the wound<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed 25 or 30. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Montreal, Nov. 5. 
         <line/>From Upper Canada we have received nothing of 
         <line/>importance. The report of the whole American 
         <line/>armies have crossed the Niagara was a mistake as 
         <line/>the last accounts from that quarter mention that Ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral Brown was still in possession of Fort Erie. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Quebec, Nov. 3. 
         <line/>We are in expectation of some further details of 
         <line/>the operations on the Niagara frontier by this day's 
         <line/>Montreal post ; but they had no arrived at one 
         <line/>o'clock. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The evacuation by the enemy of our territory on 
         <line/>that frontier is a striking illustration of the impor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance of the command of the lake. The enemy did 
         <line/>cross over to our side till the moment his fleet 
         <line/>was ready to assume the superiority. The re-appear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ance of our fleet effected what could not be done by 
         <line/>the expence of so much blood and treasure. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>(From the Quebec Gazette) 
         <line/>The American Government has published the pa<sh/>
         
         <line/>pers relating to the late negotations at Ghent. We 
         <line/>confess that we have seen these papers with feelings 
         <line/>of some satisfaction and much regret ; satisfaction 
         <line/>that we can now say that the honour of the British 
         <line/>Government is pledged to do something for Bri<sh/>
         
         <line/>tish interests in North American, and regret that that 
         <line/>something is so little. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Indians are to be made independent of both 
         <line/>nations. This is perfectly just, and would, under 
         <line/>certain cirumstances greatly add to the security of 
         <line/>these provinces. The Lakes are to be exclusively 
         <line/>British. On these subjects we must be permitted to 
         <line/>ask how long they would be permitted to remain 
         <line/>so, how long the Indians would retain their inde<sh/>
         
         <line/>pendence in the event of another war, if the commu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nication with them should be in the power of the 
         <line/>enemy ? The sole communication for military pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>poses, with the Indians and the Lakes, is by the river 
         <line/>St Lawrence, from Montreal to Kingston, and from 
         <line/>Niagara to Fort Erie ; and the Americans are to be 
         <line/>permitted to remain in possession of one of its banks ! 
         <line/>The enemy has hitherto been prevented from inter<sh/>
         
         <line/>rupting this communication by the thinness of the 
         <line/>settlements of their side, the consequent badness of 
         <line/>the roads, and difficulty of supplying a large force. 
         <line/>The possession of th southern bank of the St Law<sh/>
         
         <line/>rence between Montreal and Kingson, and the power 
         <line/>of supplying themselves, and operating on that fron<sh/>
         
         <line/>tier, by the roads now existing, and from Lake 
         <line/>Champlain, has been worth a large force to them, 
         <line/>during the whole of the war ; it has caused us to 
         <line/>parcel our force to support the line of communication 
         <line/>between Lake St Francis and Kingston, and keep a 
         <line/>great proportion of it to protect the base of that line 
         <line/>in the vicinity of Montreal. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The position of Canada, relative to the United 
         <line/>States, with its present boundaries, is an extraordi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nary one ; so much so, that intelligent military men 
         <line/>have pronounced it incapable of defence much beyond 
         <line/>Quebec. The miserable state of the enemy's prepa<sh/>
         
         <line/>rations, the superiority which we then had on the 
         <line/>Lakes, the good disposition of the inhabitants, and 
         <line/>the prudent conduct of the commander of the forces, 
         <line/>alone saved it. The waste of means in protecting 
         <line/>and conveying supplies by a communication of five 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>hundred miles, adjoining the whole way to the ene<sh/>
         
         <line/>my's frontie, is conceivable only to those whom ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>perience has made acquainted with the fact, or who 
         <line/>are habituated to reflection ; and whenever the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>munication of the Lakes becomes interrupted, the 
         <line/>supply of any force further advanced on the line be<sh/>
         
         <line/>comes utterly impracticable. The enemy derives 
         <line/>his supplies either by the Lakes, upon which an army 
         <line/>can effect nothing, or from a settled country, a long 
         <line/>way in his rear, protected by his army, a country co<sh/>
         
         <line/>vered with woods, and a militia more effective than 
         <line/>the best troops in such a country, always ready for 
         <line/>the protection of their property and their houses– 
         <line/>Under such circumstances, the weakness of an army 
         <line/>beyond a certain point is to be counted by its num<sh/>
         
         <line/>bers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We scruple not to say, that, whenever that part 
         <line/>of the State of New York extending to the St Law<sh/>
         
         <line/>rence, between Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain, 
         <line/>shall be fully settled, the whole of Upper Canada 
         <line/>must fall to the United States, the Lower Canada 
         <line/>will not be defensible but at an expence of means 
         <line/>far beyond its value. We had much rather see the 
         <line/>Americans confirmed in the possession of Sackett's 
         <line/>Harbour, Presqu-ile, Detroit and Michilimackinac, 
         <line/>than in the possession of the tract of country just 
         <line/>mentioned. Great Britain will always have the 
         <line/>means of establishing a superiority on the Lakes, 
         <line/>whenever she chuses to exert them, but she never 
         <line/>will be able to drive the Americans out of that fron<sh/>
         
         <line/>tier, when once fully settled, supported as they will 
         <line/>be by the immense population of the back parts of 
         <line/>the State of New York and adjoining States.

         <line/>Urbanna, Sept. 25. 
         <line/>An express has arrived from Detroit, to General 
         <line/>M'Arthur, in six days, in which Governor Cass 
         <line/>says–" A state of things has arrived, in which 
         <line/>your presence, with the force at your disposal, is 
         <line/>essential to the security and preservation of the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try. The Indians have recommenced hostilities on 
         <line/>every side of us ; they are murdering the people, and 
         <line/>breaking up the settlements. There is now a large 
         <line/>force of them in the immediate vicinity of this place, 
         <line/>most probably within a mile of it, with the avowed 
         <line/>purpose of attacking the town. We have no force 
         <line/>adequate to the defence of the country, and none of 
         <line/>description proper for the pursuit of the Indians– 
         <line/>My opinion is, that you should hasten on with the 
         <line/>mounted men with all possible expedition."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The express came by water, the land communia<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion being entirely cut off. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Albany, Oct. 25. 
         <line/>The Legislature of this State adjourned yesterday, 
         <line/>after a session of four weeks. The principal laws 
         <line/>passed are: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>An act to authorise the raising of troops for the defence of 
         <line/>this State. 
         <line/>An act to encourage privateering. 
         <line/>An act to authorise the raising of a corps of sea fencibles. 
         <line/>An act to provide for the repayment of certain sums of 
         <line/>money advanced by the Corporation of the city of New 
         <line/>York, for the defence of the State, and for other purposes. 
         <line/>An act to prevent the apprehension of British deserters. 
         <line/>An act to authorise the raising of two regiments of men of 
         <line/>colour. 
         <line/>An act authorising additional pay to be made to the volun<sh/>
         
         <line/>teers, and for paying the militia called into service by the 
         <line/>State authority. 
         <line/>An act to aid in the apprehension of deserters from the ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>my and navy of the United States. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The first act authorises the Governor to call into 
         <line/>actual service 12,000 men, for the term of two years,

         <line/>The following resolution, introduced by Mr Mo<sh/>

         <line/>mously on Saturday:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved unanimously–That the House of Assembly of 
         <line/>the State of New York view, with mingled emotions of sur<sh/>
         
         <line/>prise and indignation, the extravagant and disgraceful terms 
         <line/>proposed by the British Commissioners at Ghent–that, how<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever ardently they may desire the restoration of peace to their 
         <line/>country, they can never consent to receive it at the sacrifice 
         <line/>of national honour and dignity–that they therefore strongly 
         <line/>recommend to the National Legislature the adoption of the 
         <line/>vigorous and efficacious measures in the prosecution of 
         <line/>the war, as the best means of the bringing the contest to an ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>nourable termination, and of transmitting unimpaired to their 
         <line/>posterity their rights, liberty, and independence. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The following is a private letter which was brought 
         <line/>by the Liffey : 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Montreal, Nov. 5. 1814. 
         <line/>"Sir George Prevost reached Kingston on the 
         <line/>10th October, where his presence has been of the ut<sh/>
         
         <line/>most importance. Chauncey resigned his blockade 
         <line/>of that place on the 8th, and retired with his squad<sh/>
         
         <line/>ron to Sackett's Harbour. Our fleet which was 
         <line/>ready for the Lake in a few days after Sir George's 
         <line/>arrival, sailed for Niagara on the 16th, with 500 of 
         <line/>the 90th, and a supply of provisions and stores for 
         <line/>the right division, and arrived off Fort George on the 
         <line/>evening of the 18th. Having landed this reinforce<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, Sir James returned to Kingston on the 24th. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The enemy at Fort Erie having been joined by 
         <line/>General Izard's army, making a force of 7 or 8000 
         <line/>men, advanced upon General Drummond, and at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tacked our positions upon the Chippawa on the 15th 
         <line/>instant ; but having met with an opposition unexpect<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by them, and making no impression, retired on 
         <line/>the 16th and 17th to Black Creek, from whence they 
         <line/>advanced one of Izard's brigades, 1500 men, on the 
         <line/>19th, with a view of our turning our right, and attempt<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to cross the Chippawa, about six miles from its 
         <line/>mouth, where they were met with by a corps of about 
         <line/>1000 troops, under Colonel Meyers, who faced them 
         <line/>most manfully ; they skirmished the whole day, in 
         <line/>which the Glengarries supported their high charac<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter, and, in the evening, <i>Jonathan</i> finding himself 
         <line/>foiled, and unable to bring up his artillery from the 
         <line/>horrid state of the roads, retired again to the main 
         <line/>body at Black Creek. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Our casualties on this occasion were triflin– 
         <line/>those of the enemy were said to have been considerable, 
         <line/>though he refrained from exposing himself to our 
         <line/>fire in the open ground. We had two field-pieces 
         <line/>there, and whenever the enemy showed a column 
         <line/>out of the wood, a well-directed discharge soon o<sh/>
         
         <line/>bliged them to return to their shelter. By this time 
         <line/>our fleet being announced, gave alarm to the enemy, 
         <line/>and they commenced a precipitate retreat to Fort 
         <line/>Erie. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"They were purused on the 20th and 21st by 
         <line/>our advance, under Major-General Watteville, close 
         <line/>to Fort Erie, where he found them occupying the 
         <line/>high ground, which General Drummond had not 
         <line/>left many weeks before, and could push no further. 
         <line/>At the date of the last accounts from General Drum<sh/>
         
         <line/>mond, Jonathan still maintained his post, from which 
         <line/>it will require a few columns of fresh troops to dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>lodge him, but as they are now on their way to join 
         <line/>the right dividion, I trust I shall in a short time have 
         <line/>the pleasure to acquaint you of the complete expul<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion of the enemy from the Niagara frontier. It is 
         <line/>said, that for want of sufficient shelter, a part of Ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral Izard's force had crossed to Buffalo, and that 
         <line/>they had passed over some heavy artillery and stores, 
         <line/>leaving at the fort such a force as they conceived ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>pable of defending it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Sir James brough down with him the skeleton 
         <line/>of the 1st battalion of the King's regiment, and the 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>remains of the two flank companies of the 10th. He 
         <line/>sailed again on the 1st inst. taking with him about 1200 
         <line/>men, comprising the 37th, a brigade of artillery, a 9<sh/>
         
         <line/>pounder, and detachments from the 6th and 82d re<sh/>
         
         <line/>giments, and a large supply of provisions and stores. 
         <line/>The five hundred of the 9th regiment who marched to 
         <line/>York would be crossed to Niagara in the brigs ; the 9th, 
         <line/>850 strong, were to have been embarked in the fleet, 
         <line/>but Sir James could not take them. The Royals, 41st, 
         <line/>89th, and 100th, exhausted corps, return to Kingston by 
         <line/>this trip of the fleet, which I fear was scarcely able to 
         <line/>make another this season. The St Lawrence has proved 
         <line/>a noble ship, and one and all seem delighted with her. 
         <line/>The frigate in frame arrived at Kingston, where she 
         <line/>has been laid down and lengthened to make her the 
         <line/>size of the Prince Regent. The keel of a 74 is also laid 
         <line/>down there. The Americans are said to have com<sh/>
         
         <line/>menced upon two more ships of the class of the Su<sh/>
         
         <line/>perior. Letters from Michilimacinack to the 19th 
         <line/>October state, that the capture of the two schooners 
         <line/>will be attended with the most important benefits in 
         <line/>the security of that post, and the territory dependent 
         <line/>upon it. Captain Rocheblave, with the detachment 
         <line/>of the 81st under Capt. Wardrop, and artillery, ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rived there on the 14th October, without any cas<sh/>
         
         <line/>ualty among the troops ; and Mr M'Kenzie, with his 
         <line/>brigade, would arrive about the 21st. The two 
         <line/>schooners had made a trip to Nottawasage for provi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sions and supplies, and would attempt another before 
         <line/>the navigation closed. A reinforcement had been 
         <line/>sent under Capt Bulgar to Praire du Chain. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The arrangements necessary for reinforcing and 
         <line/>supplying General Drummond's army being com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pleted, and the attack upon Sackett's Harbour being 
         <line/>deemed impracticable this season, Sir George return<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed last evening to this place ; his journey to King<sh/>
         
         <line/>ston has certainly had the effect of inducing Ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral Brown, with a considerable part of his force, 
         <line/>to move to Sackett's Harbour, and has thus left 
         <line/>General Izard so much weakened at Fort Erie, that 
         <line/>I have little doubt of the result of an attack upon 
         <line/>him. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I am sorry to see that the malice of a certain party 
         <line/>here has been at work at your side of the water ; it 
         <line/>has increased tenfold since the expression of the 
         <line/>public sentiment in favour of his Excellency, by the 
         <line/>addresses which are now preparing, and which I 
         <line/>can assure you is the real and unsolicited voice 
         <line/>of the people. I am happy to find that General 
         <line/>Kempt is going to England, as he will afford true 
         <line/>information upon the state of the country, and be 
         <line/>able to exposethe falsehoods which have been circu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lated respecting recent events."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>A journey into the interior of New South Wales, across the 
         <line/>Blue Mountains, performed by his Excellency Colonel Mac 
         <line/>quarrie, Governor of the settlement. From the official ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count, dated Sydney, June 10. 1815. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor desires to communicate, for the 
         <line/>information of the public, the result of his late 
         <line/>tour over the Western or Blue Mountains, un<sh/>
         
         <line/>dertaken for the purpose of being enabled per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sonally to appreciate the importance of the track 
         <line/>of country lying westward of them, which had 
         <line/>been explored in the latter end of the year 1813, 
         <line/>and beginning of 1814, by Mr George William 
         <line/>Evans, Deputy Surveyor of Lands. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>To those who know how very limited a track 
         <line/>of country has been hitherto occupied by the 
         <line/>colonists of New South Walves, extending along 
         <line/>the eastern coast to the north and south of Port 
         <line/>Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 
         <line/>miles, to the foot of that chain of mountains in 
         <line/>the interior which forms its western boundary, 
         <line/>it must be a subject of astonishment and regret, 
         <line/>that amongst so large a population no one ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>peared, within the first twenty-five years of the 
         <line/>establishment of this settlement, possessed of suf<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficient energy of mind to induce him fully to ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>plore a passage over these mountains ; but when 
         <line/>it is considered that for the greater part of that 
         <line/>time even this circumscribed portion of country 
         <line/>afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the 
         <line/>people, whilst on the other hand, the whole sur<sh/>
         
         <line/>face of the country beyond those limits was a 
         <line/>thick, and in many places, nearly an impene<sh/>
         
         <line/>trable forest, the surprise at the want of effort to 
         <line/>surmount such difficulties must abate very con<sh/>
         
         <line/>siderably. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The records of the colony only afford two in<sh/>
         
         <line/>stances of any bold attempt having been made to 
         <line/>discover the country to the westward of the Blue 
         <line/>Mountains. The first was by Mr Bass, and the 
         <line/>other by Mr Caley, and both ended in disap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointment; a cirumstance which will not be 
         <line/>much wondered at by those who have lately cross<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed these mountains. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, 
         <line/>Esqrs. and Liutenant Lawson, of the Royal 
         <line/>veteran company, the merit is due of having, 
         <line/>with extraordinary patience and much fatigu, ef<sh/>
         
         <line/>fected the first passage over the most rugged and 
         <line/>difficult part of the Blue Mountains. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor being strongly impressed with 
         <line/>the importance of the object, had, early after his 
         <line/>arrival in this colony, formed the resolution of 
         <line/>encouraging the attempt to find a passage to the 
         <line/>western country, and willingly availed himself of 
         <line/>the facilities which the discoveries of these three 
         <line/>gentlemen afforded him. Accordingly, on the 
         <line/>20th of November 1813, he entrusted the ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>complishment of this object to Mr George Wil<sh/>
         
         <line/>liam Evans, deputy surveyor of lands, the result 
         <line/>of whose journey was laid before the public, 
         <line/>through the medium of the Sydney Gazette, on 
         <line/>the 12th of February, 1814. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The favourable account given by Mr Evans 
         <line/>of the country he had explored, induced the 
         <line/>Governor to cause a road to be constructed for 
         <line/>the passage and conveyance of cattle and pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions to the interior ; and men of good cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>racter, from amongst a number of convicts who 
         <line/>had volunteered their services, were selected to 
         <line/>perform this arduous work, on condition of be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing fed and clothed during the continuance of 
         <line/>their labour, and being granted emancipations 
         <line/>as their final reward on the completion of the 
         <line/>work. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The direction and superintendence of this great 
         <line/>work was entrusted to William Cox. Esq. the 
         <line/>chief magistrate at Windsor ; and to the asto<sh/>
         
         <line/>nishment of every one who knows what was to be 
         <line/>encountered, and sees what has been done, he 
         <line/>effected its completion in six months from the 
         <line/>time of its commencement, happily without the 
         <line/>loss of a man, or any serious accident. The 
         <line/>Governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the 
         <line/>services rendered by Mr Cox to this colony, in 
         <line/>the execution of this arduous work, which pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>mises to be of the greatest public utility, by 
         <line/>opening a new source of wealth to the indus<sh/>
         
         <line/>trious and enterprising. When it is considered 
         <line/>that Mr Cox voluntarily relinquished the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>forts of his own house, and the society of his 
         <line/>numerous family, and exposed himself to much 
         <line/>personal fatigue, with only such temporary co<sh/>
         
         <line/>vering as the bark hut could afford from the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>clemency of the season, it is difficult to express 
         <line/>the sentiments of approbation to which such pri<sh/>
         
         <line/>vations and services are entitled. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Cox having reported the road as complet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed on the 21st of January, the Governor, ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>companied by Mrs Macquarrie, and that gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>man, commenced his tour on the 25th of April 
         <line/>last, over the Blue Mountains, and was joined 
         <line/>by Sir John Jamieson, at the Nepean, who ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>companied him during the entire tour. The fol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lowing gentlemen composed the Governor's suite: 
         <line/>Mr Campbell, Secretary ; Captain Antill, Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>jor of Brigade ; Lieutenant Watts, Aide de<sh/>
         
         <line/> camp ; Mr Redfern, Assistant-Surgeon ; Mr 
         <line/>Oxley, Surveyor-General ; Mr Mehan, Deputy 
         <line/>Surveyor-General ; Mr Lewin, Painter and Na<sh/>
         
         <line/>turalist ; and Mr G. Evans, Deputy Surveyor of 
         <line/>lands, who had been sent forward for the pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose of making further discoveries, and rejoined 
         <line/>the party on the day of arrival at Bathurst 
         <line/>Plains. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The commencement of the ascent from Emu 
         <line/>Plains to the first depot, and thence to a resting 
         <line/>place, now called Spring Wood, distant twelve 
         <line/>miles from Emu Ford, was through a very hand<sh/>
         
         <line/>some open forests of lofty trees, and much more 
         <line/>practicable and easy than was expected. The 
         <line/>facility of the ascent for this distance excited 
         <line/>surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to 
         <line/>give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he 
         <line/>has afterwards to encounter. At a further dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>stance of four miles a sudden change is perceiv<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed in the appearance of the timber and the qua<sh/>
         
         <line/>lity of the soil, the former becoming stunted, and 
         <line/>the latter barren and rocky. At this place, the 
         <line/>fatigues of the journey may be said to commence. 
         <line/>Here the country became altogether mountain<sh/>
         
         <line/>ous, and extremely rugged. Near to the 18th 
         <line/>mile (it is to be observed that the measure com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mences at Emu Ford), a pile of stones attracted 
         <line/>attention. It is close to the line of road, on the 
         <line/>top of a rugged and abrupt ascent, and is sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed to have been placed there by Mr Caley, as 
         <line/>the extreme limit of his tour. Hence the Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernor gave that part of the mountain the name 
         <line/>as Caley's[?] Repulse. To have penetrated even so 
         <line/>far was at that time an effort of no small difficul<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty. From henceforward to the 26th mile is a 
         <line/>succession of steep and rugged hills, some of 
         <line/>which are almost so abrupt as to deny a passage 
         <line/>altogether ; but at this place a considerable ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tensive plain is arrived at, which constitutes the 
         <line/>summit of the western mountains ; and from 
         <line/>thence a most extensive and beautiful prospect 
         <line/>presents itself on all sides to the eye. The town 
         <line/>of Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect 
         <column/>
         <line/>Hill, and other objects within that part of the 
         <line/>colony now inhabited, of equal interest, are dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tinctly seen from hence. The majestic gran<sh/>
         
         <line/>deur of the situation, combined with the various 
         <line/>objects to be seen from this place, induced the 
         <line/>Governor to give it the appellation of the King's 
         <line/>Table Land. On the south-west side of the 
         <line/>King's Table Land the mountain terminates in 
         <line/>abrupt precipices of immense depth, at the bot<sh/>
         
         <line/>tom of which is seen a glen, as romantically 
         <line/>beautiful as can be imagined, bounded on the 
         <line/>further side by mountains of great magnitude, 
         <line/>terminating equally abruptly as the others, and 
         <line/>the whole thickly covered with wood. The 
         <line/>length of this picturesque and remarkable track of 
         <line/>country is about 24 miles, to which the Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernor gave the name of the Prince Regent's 
         <line/>Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third 
         <line/>mile, on the top of a hill, an opening presents 
         <line/>itself on the south-west side of the Prince 
         <line/>Regent's Glen, from whence a view is obtained 
         <line/>particularly beautiful and grand–mountains ris<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing beyond mountains, with stupendous masses 
         <line/>of rock in the fore ground, here strike the eye 
         <line/>with admiration and astonishment. The circular 
         <line/>form in which the whole is so wonderfully dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed induced the Governor to give the name of 
         <line/>Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the Right 
         <line/>Hon. William Pitt) to this offset of branch from the 
         <line/>Prince Regent's Glen. The road continues from 
         <line/>hence for the space of 17 miles on the ridge of 
         <line/>the mountain which forms one side of the Prince 
         <line/>Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly terminates 
         <line/>in nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet 
         <line/>high, as ascertained by measurement. The road 
         <line/>constructed by Mr Cox down this rugged and 
         <line/>tremendous descent, through all its windings, is 
         <line/>no less than three-fourths of a mile in length, 
         <line/>and has been executed with such skill and sta<sh/>
         
         <line/>bility as reflects much credit on him. The la<sh/>
         
         <line/>bour here undergone, and the difficulties sur<sh/>
         
         <line/>mounted, can only be appreciated by those who 
         <line/>view this scene. In order to perpetuate the me<sh/>
         
         <line/>mory of Mr Cox's services, the Governor deem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed it a tribute justly due to him to give his name 
         <line/>to this grand and extraordinary pass, and he ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>cordingly called it Cox's Pass. Having descend<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed into a valley at the bottom of this pass, the 
         <line/>retrospective view of the overhanging mountain 
         <line/>is magnificently grand. Although the present 
         <line/>pass is the only practicable point yet discovered 
         <line/>for descending by, yet the mountain is much 
         <line/>higher than those on either side of it, from 
         <line/>whence it is distinguished at a considerable dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance, when approaching it from the interior, 
         <line/>and in this point of view it has the appearance 
         <line/>of a very high distinct hill, although it is in fact 
         <line/>only the abrupt termination of a ridge. The 
         <line/>Governor gave the name of Mount York to this 
         <line/>termination of the ridge, in honour of his Royal 
         <line/>Highness the Duke of York. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On descending Cox' Pass, the Governor was 
         <line/>much gratified by the appearance of good pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture land and soil fit for cultivation, which was 
         <line/>the first he had met with since the commencement 
         <line/>of his tour. The valley at the base of Mount 
         <line/>York he called the Vale of Clwyd, in conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of the strong resemblance it bore to the 
         <line/>vale of that name in North Wales. The grass 
         <line/>in this vale is of a good quality, and very [?]<sh/>
         
         <line/>dant, and a rivulet of fine water runs along it 
         <line/>from the eastward, which unites itself at the 
         <line/>western extremity of the vale with another ri<sh/>
         
         <line/>vulet containing still more water. The junction 
         <line/>of these two streams forms a very handsome river, 
         <line/>now called by the Governor, Cox's River, which 
         <line/>takes its course, as has been since ascertained 
         <line/>through the Prince Regent's Glen, and empties 
         <line/>itself into the river Nepean ; and it is conjec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tured, from the nature of the country through 
         <line/>which it passes, that it mut be one of the prin<sh/>
         
         <line/>cipal causes of the floods which have been occa<sh/>
         
         <line/>sionally felt on the low banks of the river Hawkes<sh/>
         
         <line/>bury, into which the Nepean discharges itself. 
         <line/>The Vale of Clwyd, from the base of Mount 
         <line/>York, extends six miles in a westerly direction, 
         <line/>and has its termination at Cox's River. West<sh/>
         
         <line/>ward of this river the country again becomes 
         <line/>hilly, but it is generally open forest land, and 
         <line/>very good passage. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Three miles to the westward of the Vale of 
         <line/>Clwyd, Messrs Blaxland, Wentworth, and Law<sh/>
         
         <line/>son, had formerly terminated their excursion ; 
         <line/>and when the various difficulties are consider<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed which they had to contend with, especially 
         <line/>until they had effected the descent from Mount 
         <line/>York, to which place they were obliged to pass 
         <line/>through a thick brush-wood, where they were 
         <line/>under the necessity of cutting a passage for 
         <line/>their baggage horses, the severity of which 
         <line/>labour had seriously affected their healths, 
         <line/>their patient endurance of such fatigue cannot 
         <line/>fail to excite much surprise and admiration. 
         <line/>In commemoration of their merits, three beauti<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful high hills, joining each other at the end of 
         <line/>their tour at this place, have receieved their 
         <line/>names in the following order, viz. Mount Blax<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, Wentworth's Sugar Loaf, and Lawson's 
         <line/>Sugar Load. A range of very lofty hills and 
         <line/>narrow vallies alternately form the track of 
         <line/>country from Cox's River, for a distance of 16 
         <line/>miles, until the Fish River is arrived at ; and the 
         <line/>stage between these rivers is consequently very 
         <line/>severe and oppressive on the cattle. To this 
         <line/>range the Governor gave the name of Clarence 
         <line/>Hilly Range. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short 
         <line/>distance from it, a very singular and beautiful 
         <line/>mountain attracts the attentions, its summit be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing crowned with a large and very extraordinary 
         <line/>looking rock, nearly circular in form, which 
         <line/>gives the whole very much the appearance of 
         <line/>a hill fort, such as are frequent in India. To 
         <line/>this lofty hill Mr Evans, who was the first Eu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ropean discoverer, gave the name of Mount 
         <line/>Evans. Passing on from hence the country con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tinues hilly, but affords good pasturage, gradu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ally improving to Sidmouth Valley, which is 
         <line/>distant from the pass of the Fish RIver eight 
         <line/>miles. The land here is level, and the first met 
         <line/>with unencumbered with timber. It is not of 
         <line/>very considerable extent, but abounds with a 
         <line/>great variety of herbs and plants, such as would 
         <line/>probably highly interest and gratify the scientific 
         <line/>botanist. The beautiful little valley runs north<sh/>
         
         <line/>west and south-east, between hills of easy ascent, 
         <line/>thinly covered with timber. Leaving Sidmouth 
         <line/>Valley, the country becomes again hilly, and in 
         <line/>other respects resembles very much the country 
         <line/>to the eastward of the valley for some miles. 
         <line/>Having reached Campbell River, distant 13 miles 
         <line/>from Sidmouth Valley, the Governor was high<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly gratified by the appearance of the country, 
         <line/>which there began to exhibity an open and ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile 
         <line/>plains. Judging from the height of the banks, 
         <line/>and its general width, the Campbell River must 
         <line/>be on some occasions of very considerable mag<sh/>
         
         <line/>nitude ; but the extraordinary drought which 
         <line/>has apparently prevailed on the western side of 
         <line/>the mountains, equally as throughout this colony 
         <column/>
         <line/>for the last three years, has reduced this river 
         <line/>so much, that it may be more properly called a 
         <line/>chain of pools than a running stream at the pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sent time. In the reaches or pools of the Camp<sh/>
         
         <line/>bell River, the very curious animal called the 
         <line/>Paradox, or Water Mole, is seen in great num<sh/>
         
         <line/>bers. The soil on both banks is uncommonly 
         <line/>rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. 
         <line/>Two miles to the southward of the line of road 
         <line/>which crosses the Campbell River, there is a 
         <line/>very fine rich track of low lands, which has been 
         <line/>named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here 
         <line/>growing in considerable quanities. The Fish 
         <line/>River, which forms a junction with the Campbell 
         <line/>River a few miles to the northward of the road 
         <line/>and bridge over the latter, has also two very 
         <line/>fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Con<sh/>
         
         <line/>nel Plains, and the other Macquarrie Plains, both 
         <line/>of considerable extent, and very capable of yield<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing all the necessities of life. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At the distance of seven miles from the bridge 
         <line/>over the Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open 
         <line/>to the view, presenting a rich track of cham<sh/>
         
         <line/>paign country of 11 miles in length, bounded on 
         <line/>both sides by gently rising and very beautiful 
         <line/>hills, thinly wooded. The Macquarrie River, 
         <line/>which is constituted by the junction of the Fish 
         <line/>and Campbell River, takes a winding course 
         <line/>through the Plains, which can be easily traced 
         <line/>from the high lands ajoining, by the particular 
         <line/>verdure of the trees on its banks, which are like<sh/>
         
         <line/>wise the only trees throughout the extent of the 
         <line/>plains. The level and clean surface of these 
         <line/>plains gives them at first view very much the 
         <line/>appearance of lands in a state of cultivation. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is impossible to behold this grand scene 
         <line/>without a feeling of admiration and surprise, 
         <line/>whilst the silence and solitude which reign in a 
         <line/>space of such extent and beauty as seems design<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by Nature for the occupancy and comfort of 
         <line/>man created a degree of melancholy in the mind 
         <line/>which may be more easily imagined than de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scribed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor and suite arrived at these Plains 
         <line/>on Thursday the 4th of May, and encamped on 
         <line/>the southern or left bank of the Macquarrie 
         <line/>River–the situation being selected in conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of its commanding a beautiful and exten<sh/>
         
         <line/>sive prospect for many miles in every direction 
         <line/>around it. At this place the Governor remained 
         <line/>for a week, which time he occupied in making 
         <line/>excursions in different directions through the 
         <line/>adjoining country, on both sides the river. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Sunday, the 7th of May, the Governor 
         <line/>fixed on a site suitable for the erection of a town 
         <line/>at some future period, to which he gave the name 
         <line/>of Bathurst, in honour of the present Secretary 
         <line/>of State for the Colonies. The situation of Ba<sh/>
         
         <line/>thurst is elevated sufficiently beyond the reach 
         <line/>of any floods which may occur, and is at the 
         <line/>same time so near to the river on its south bank 
         <line/>as to derive all the advantages of its clear and 
         <line/>beautiful stream. The mechanics and settlers of 
         <line/>whatever description who may be hereafter per<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted to form permanent residences to them<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves at this place will have the highly import<sh/>
         
         <line/>ant advantages of a rich and fertile soil, with a 
         <line/>beautiful river flowing through it, for all the uses 
         <line/>of man. The Governor mut however add, that 
         <line/>the hopes which were once so sanguinely enter<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained of this river becoming navigable to the 
         <line/>Western Sea have ended in disappointment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>During the week that the Governor remained 
         <line/>at Bathurst he made daily excursions in various 
         <line/>directions ; one of these extended 22 miles in a 
         <line/>south-west direction, and on that occasion, as 
         <line/>well as on all the others, he found the country 
         <line/>chiefly composed of vallies and plains, separated 
         <line/>occasionally by ranges of low hills; the soil 
         <line/>throughout being generally fertile, and well cir<sh/>
         
         <line/>cumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or 
         <line/>grazing. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor here feels much pleasure in be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing enabled to communicate to the public that 
         <line/>the favourable reports which he had received of 
         <line/>the country to the west of the Blue Mountains 
         <line/>have not been by any means exaggerated. The 
         <line/>difficulties which present themselves in the jour<sh/>
         
         <line/>ney from hence are certainly great and inevi<sh/>
         
         <line/>table, but thsoe persons who may be inclined to 
         <line/>become permanent settlers there will probably con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tent themselves withvisiting this part of the colony 
         <line/>but rarely, and of course will have them seldom 
         <line/>to encounter. Plenty of water, and a sufficien<sh/>
         
         <line/>cy of grass are to be found in the mountains for 
         <line/>the support of such cattle as may be sent over 
         <line/>them ; and the tracks of fertile soil and rich pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>turage which the new country affords are fully 
         <line/>extensive enough for any increase of population 
         <line/>and stock which can possibly take place for ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>ny years. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Within a distance of ten miles from the site of 
         <line/>Bathurst there is not less than 50,000 acres of 
         <line/>land clear of timber, and fully one half of that 
         <line/>may be considered excellent soil, well calculated 
         <line/>for cultivation. It is a matter of regrets that in 
         <line/>proportion as the soil improves the timber dege<sh/>
         
         <line/>nerates ; and it is to be remarked, that every<sh/>
         
         <line/>where to the westward of the mountains it is 
         <line/>much inferior both in size and quality to that 
         <line/>within the present colony ; there is, however, a 
         <line/>sufficiency of timber of tolerable quality within 
         <line/>the district around Bathurst for the purposes of 
         <line/>house-building and husbandry. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor has here to lament that neither 
         <line/>coals nor limestone have been yet discovered in 
         <line/>the western country ; articles in themselves of 
         <line/>so much importance, that the want of them must 
         <line/>be severely felt whenever that country shall 
         <line/>be settled.

         <line/>Having enumerated the principal and most im<sh/>
         
         <line/>portant features of this new country, the Gover<sh/>
         
         <line/>nor has now to notice some of its live produc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions. All around Bathurst abounds in a variety 
         <line/>of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a 
         <line/>great quantity of fish, but all of one denomina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, resembling the perch in appearance, and of 
         <line/>a delicate and fine flavour, not unlike that of a 
         <line/>rock cod. This fish grows to a large size, and 
         <line/>is very voracious. Several of them were caught 
         <line/>during the Governor's stay at Bathurst, and at 
         <line/>the halting place on the Fish River. One of 
         <line/>those caught weight 17 lb ; and the people 
         <line/>stationed at Bathurst stated that they had caught 
         <line/>some weighing 25 lb. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black 
         <line/>swans, wild geese, wild turkies, bustards, ducks 
         <line/>of various kinds, quail, bronze, and other pi<sh/>
         
         <line/>geons, &amp;c. &amp;c. The water mole, or paradox, 
         <line/>also abounds in all the rivers and ponds. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The site designed for the towns of Bathurst, by 
         <line/>observation taken at the Flag Staff, which was 
         <line/>erected on the day of Bathurst receiving that 
         <line/>name, is situated in latitude 33. 24. 30. south, 
         <line/>being also 27 1/2 miles north of Government House, 
         <line/>In Sydney, and 94 1/2 west of it, bearing west 20. 
         <line/>30. north, 83 geographic miles, or 95 1/2 statute 
         <line/>miles ; the measured road distance from Sydney 
         <line/>to Bathurst being 140 English miles. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The road constructed by Mr Cox, and the 
         <column/>
         <line/>party under him, commences at Emu Ford, on 
         <line/>the left bank of the river Nepean, and is thence 
         <line/>carried 101 1/2 miles to the flag staff at Bathurst. 
         <line/>This road has been carefully measured, and each 
         <line/>mile regularly marked on the trees growing on 
         <line/>the left side of the road proceeding towards Ba<sh/>
         
         <line/>thurst. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor in his tour made the following 
         <line/>stages, in which he was principally regulated by 
         <line/>the consideration of having good pasturage for 
         <line/>the cattle, and plenty of water :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>1st stage–Spring Wood, distant from Emu Ford 12 miles 
         <line/>2d stage ditto–Jamieson's Valley, or 2d depot, distant 
         <line/>from ditto . . . . . . . . . . 28 
         <line/>3d ditto–Blackheath, distant from ditto . . . 41 
         <line/>4th ditto–Cox's River, distant from ditto . . .56 
         <line/>5th ditto–The Fish River, distant from ditto . 72 
         <line/>6th ditto–Sidmouth Valley, distant from ditto . 80 
         <line/>7th ditto–Campbell River, distant from ditto . 91 
         <line/>8th ditto–Bathurst distant from ditto . . . 101 1/2 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At all of which places the traveller may as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sure himself of good grass, and water in abun<sh/>
         
         <line/>dance. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Thursday, the 11th of May, the Gover<sh/>
         
         <line/>nor and suite set out from Bathurst on their 
         <line/>return, and arrived at Sidney on Friday the 
         <line/>19th Ult. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor deems it expedient here to no<sh/>
         
         <line/>tify to the public, that he does not mean to make 
         <line/>any grants of land to the westward of the Blue 
         <line/>Mountains, until he shall receive the commands 
         <line/>of his Majesty's Ministers on that subject, and 
         <line/>in reply to the report he is now about to make 
         <line/>them upon it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the mean time, such gentlemen or other 
         <line/>respectable free persons as may wish to visit this 
         <line/>new country will be permitted to do so, on mak<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing a written application to the Governor to that 
         <line/>effect, who will order them to be furnished with 
         <line/>written passes. It is at the same time strictly or<sh/>
         
         <line/>dered and directed that no person, whether civil 
         <line/>or military, shall attempt to travel over the Blue 
         <line/>Mountains without having previously applied for 
         <line/>and obtained permission, in the above prescribed 
         <line/>form. The military guard stationed at the first 
         <line/>depot on the mountains will receive full instruc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions to prevent the progress of any persons who 
         <line/>shall not have obtained regular passes. The ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>cessity for the establishing and strictly enforcing 
         <line/>this regulation is too obvious to every one 
         <line/>who will reflect on it to require any explanation 
         <line/>here. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Governor cannot conclude this account 
         <line/>of his tour, without offering his best ackow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ledgements to William Cox, Esq. for the impor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tant services he has rendered to the colony in so 
         <line/>short a period of time, by opening a passage to 
         <line/>the new discovered country, and at the same time 
         <line/>assuring him that he shall have great pleasure in 
         <line/>recommending his meritorious services on this 
         <line/>occasion to the favourable consideration of his 
         <line/>Majesty's Ministers.

         <line/>Montreal, Oct. 5. 
         <line/>On the afternoon of Saturday last, the specie 
         <line/>seized on board the Lake Champlain steam-boat, 
         <line/>amounting to upward of 12,000 dollars, arrived 
         <line/>at his Majesty's cash-office here, under the es<sh/>
         
         <line/>cort of the 19th light dragoons from St John's. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At length we have authentic accounts relating 
         <line/>to the expedition of Lord Selkirk ; they are very 
         <line/>important, as many <i>ex parte</i> details have been 
         <line/>published - his taking Fort William by storm, 
         <line/>making all the partners of the North West Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany prisoners, &amp;c. ; but the cause of the expe 
         <line/>dition has never been explained. The Canadian 
         <line/>Courant puts it in a very clear point of view:– 
         <line/>Mr Robert Semple, the Governor-General 
         <line/>The Hudson's Bay Company on the Red River, 
         <line/>towards the close of the year 1815, took posses<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion of two establishments belonging to the North 
         <line/>West Company, which had obtruded themselves 
         <line/>on the territory of the Hudson's Bay Company. 
         <line/>The North West traders then altered their 
         <line/>route, going into the Upper Country by circuit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ous ways, by which much delay took place ; and 
         <line/>in order to try Mr Semple, they sent two cart<sh/>
         
         <line/>loads of provisions by the former track in June 
         <line/>last, with a guard of fifty men ; the advance, 
         <line/>twenty-two of the number, fell in with one of 
         <line/>the natives, whom they took forward with them 
         <line/>to prevent discovery. The rear-guard passed 
         <line/>within four miles of the settlement ; they were 
         <line/>perceived by the Governor, and were attacked 
         <line/>by a party from the garrison, consisting of about 
         <line/>thirty soldiers ; an engagement took place, stat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed on the 19th of June. Mr Semple and 21 
         <line/>of his men were killed ; the rest of his forces 
         <line/>returned defeated to the fort ; it is on this ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count that the expedition of Lord Selkirk was 
         <line/>undertaken. The manner of Lord Selkirk's con<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducting the expedition we do not justify, nor in<sh/>
         
         <line/>deed can we form any opinion on the subject 
         <line/>without further authentic details ; it is, however, 
         <line/>but justice to say, that the Hudson's Bay Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany have rights, and are a chartered Company ; 
         <line/>the North West Traders, though we believe a 
         <line/>most respectable body, are only an Association 
         <line/>of Merchants.

         <line/>North West Company. As yet have not had an accurate 
         <line/>statement of that melancholy transaction. Lord Selkirk's party 
         <line/>state that these half-breed with some of the North West Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany servants, came to destroy the settlement, and that Mr 
         <line/>Semple, with about 25 of the Colonists, went out to meet them, 
         <line/>to know what could be their intentions, when those rascals com<sh/>
         
         <line/>menced firing on them, and massacred all but three, who were for<sh/>
         
         <line/>tunate enough to make their escape. The North West people's 
         <line/>account is that these <i>half-breeds</i> with some <i>Indians</i> were bring<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing down provisions from the upper part of the Red River to the 
         <line/>entrance near Lake Winipie, and as the Colonists had the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mand of a great part of the river, they were obliged to pass in the 
         <line/>rear of the settlement, which being observed by Governor Sem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ple, who was on the look-out for them, he settled out of his Fort 
         <line/>with 25 men and a [?]-piece to take from the Indians the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions which were intended for the North West Company ; that 
         <line/>the result[?] was an engagement which terminated in the defeat of 
         <line/>the Colonists, of whom twenty-two were killed. Lord Selkirk

         <line/>and several bales[?] of Merchandise, which he found in possession of 
         <line/>the North West Company, belonging to the Hudson's Bay Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany. The Police Officers in Montreal were several days exa<sh/>
         
         <line/>mining the papers, and about four or five days after the arrival of 
         <line/>Mr M'Gillivray and the others, they were admitted to bail, to ap<sh/>

      <p>
         <line/>On Wednesday evening, the 27th March, 
         <line/>we embarked on board the Importer, D. 
         <line/>Ogden, master, bound to New York, where we 
         <line/>arrived on the 5th of May, with about 40 steer<sh/>
         
         <line/>age passengers, farmers, and tradesmen, who 
         <line/>were fleeing from ruin and starvation. In all re<sh/>
         
         <line/>spects that can be named our passage disa<sh/>
         
         <line/>greeable, and upon one occasion very perilous, 
         <line/>from lightning, which struck the ship twice, 
         <line/>shivered two of the masts, killed a man, struck 
         <line/>several people slightly, between two of whom I 
         <line/>was sitting, without at all feeling the blow. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Some of our fellow-passengers have found 
         <line/>great disappointment ; and, it is stated in some 
         <line/>of the public papers here, that many hundreds 
         <line/>have, during the last year, accepted of the offer 
         <line/>of our Consul at New York to go and settle in 
         <line/>Canada. You know that I have never advised any 
         <line/>body to emigrate. I have always said that it is 
         <line/>no place for manufacturers ; no place for men to 
         <line/>live without work ; no place for a farmer who 
         <line/>does not work himself ; no place in short, for 
         <line/>any one who is not able and willing to work 
         <line/>at the ordinary sorts of work ; but for such 
         <line/>men there is every where a plentiful, happy, 
         <line/>and easy life. None should come, however, 
         <line/>who have any views of idleness ; and even 
         <line/>for the industrious poor, I see no reason why 
         <line/>they should expend their last shilling, and under<sh/>
         
         <line/>go all the miseries and dangers of a sea voyage, 
         <line/>in order to save those who eat the taxes the ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pence of their share of poor-rates ; a man and 
         <line/>his wife and a child or two cannot come under 
         <line/>the expence of 35 guineas, at least. A single 
         <line/>man 20 guineas, before he gets into work again ; 
         <line/>and, as I always said, I never would, if I were 
         <line/>in the place of such a man, expend my earnings 
         <line/>on a sea voyage, and endure all its hardships, 
         <line/>in order to remove one eye sore out of the way 
         <line/>of corruption. Besides, there is the climate, 
         <line/>which is not so good as ours, though it is not 
         <line/>bad, and people often live to an old age. The 
         <line/>country is good, but it will easily be conceived, 
         <line/>that new face, an entire new scene, a separa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion from every friend, work done in a quite dif<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferent way from it is in England ; it will
         <line/>easily be conceived, that all this makes such a 
         <line/>dislocation in a man's mind as to make him very 
         <line/>unhappy for a while. Then, he cannot expect 
         <line/>to find work the first day. He must ask first, at 
         <line/>any rate. Englishmen are sheepish ; and, they 
         <line/>are sure to find rascals enough here to foster 
         <line/>their disgust, merely for the sake of serving the 
         <line/>cause of corruption at home. In short, I advice 
         <line/>nobody to emigrate, but I will truly describe 
         <line/>the country and the people. As to emigrating with 
         <line/>a view of settling and farming in the new countries, 
         <line/>it is neither more nor less than downright mad<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness. It is what our English farmers know no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing at all about ; it is what they are not at all 
         <line/>fit for ; and the far greater part of all such spe<sh/>
         
         <line/>culations end in disappointment, if not in ruin 
         <line/>and premature death. I hope that our beloved 
         <line/>country will shortly be fit for an honest and in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dustrious man to live in ; but if any farmers come 
         <line/>with money in their pockets, my advice is, not 
         <line/>to give way either to enthusiastic admiration, or 
         <line/>to instant disgust. But, to stop a little ; to look 
         <line/>about them ; to see not only after good land, but 
         <line/>a good market for its products. The western 
         <line/>romance writers tell us, that the land in the 
         <line/>Ohio is too good ; but Mr Mellish, in his valu<sh/>
         
         <line/>able book, tells us, that beef and pork sell for 
         <line/>three halfpence a pound. An excellent coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try for people who want to do nothing but eat. – 
         <line/>Give me Long Island, where the land is not too 
         <line/>good ; but where beef and pork sell for about 
         <line/>eightpence a pound (I speak of English money); 
         <line/>where good hay sells for five pounts a ton ; and 
         <line/>where there is a ready market for every species of 
         <line/>produce. One thing above all ; if an English far<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer (I mean by English, people of the whole of 
         <line/>the United Kingdom) comes here, with money 
         <line/>in his pocket, let him resolve to keep it there for 
         <line/>a year, and then he will be sure to do well. – 
         <line/>All that I see around me here is well calculated to 
         <line/>attract the attention and to please the sight of one, 
         <line/>like myself, brought up in the country, always 
         <line/>greatly delighted with, and somewhat skilled in, 
         <line/>various pleasing and healthful pursuits. The 
         <line/>The people are engaged busily in planting their In<sh/>
         
         <line/>dian corn. The cherry trees, of which there are 
         <line/>multitudes, planted in long avenues or rows, or 
         <line/>round the fields, have dropped their blossom and 
         <line/>begin to show their loads of fruit. The apple 
         <line/>and pear orchards, in extent from one to twenty 
         <line/>acres on each farm, are in full and beautiful 
         <line/>bloom. The farms are small in extent ; no ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pearance of want amongst the labourers, who re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceive, in the country, about two shillings and 
         <line/>threepence (our money) a-day, with board and 
         <line/>lodging, and which board consists of plenty of 
         <line/>excellent meat and fish of all sorts, the best of 
         <line/>bread, butter, cheese, and eggs. That you may 
         <line/>form some idea as to prices of living, I will state 
         <line/>a few facts, which have already come within my 
         <line/>own knowledge. We are at present at an inn, 
         <line/>thirteen miles from New York. It is on the 
         <line/>road to that city. Scarcely an hour in the 
         <line/>day passes without a carriage of some sort offer<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing for going thither, and to go by the regular 
         <line/>stage costs three shillings. Mind, I shall al<sh/>
         
         <line/>ways speak in English money, when I do not 
         <line/>speak of dollars. We lodge and board in 
         <line/>this inn, have each a bed-room and good 
         <line/>bed, have a room to sit in ourselves ; 
         <line/>we eat by ourselves ; and it really is eating. 
         <line/>– We have smoked fish, chops, butter, and eggs, 
         <line/>for breakfast, with bread (the very finest I ever 
         <line/>sa), crackers, sweet cakes ; and when I say 
         <line/>that we have such and such things, I do not 
         <line/>mean that we get them for show, or just enough 
         <line/>to smell to ; but in loads. Not an egg, but a 
         <line/>dish full of eggs. Not a snip of meat or of fish ; 
         <line/>but a plateful. Lump sugar for our tea and cof<sh/>
         
         <line/>fee ; not broke into little bits the size of a hazle 
         <line/>nut, but in good thumping pieces. For dinner, 
         <line/>we have the finest of fish, bass, mackerel, lob<sh/>
         
         <line/>sters ; of meat, lamb, veal, ham &amp;c. ; aspara<sh/>
         
         <line/>gus in plenty ; apple pieces (through in the middle 
         <line/>of May). The supper is like the breakfast, with 
         <line/>preserved peaches and other things. And with 
         <line/>all this an excellent cyder to drink, with the 
         <line/>kindest and most obliging treatment, on the part 
         <line/>of the landlord and landlady, and their sons and 
         <line/>daughters, we pay no more than 22s. 6d. a week 
         <line/>each. In England the same food and drink and 
         <line/>lodging at an inn would cost us nearly the same 
         <line/>sum every day. But there are two things which 
         <line/>no money can purchase any where. The first is, 
         <line/>no grumbling on the part of the landlady, except 
         <line/>on account of our eating and drinking too little ; 
         <line/>and the other is, that Mr Wiggins has no fasten<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing but a bit of chip run in over the latch of the 
         <line/>door, to a house which is full of valuable things 
         <line/>of all sorts, and about which we leave all our things 
         <line/>much more carelessly than we should do in our 
         <line/>own house in any part of England. Here, then 
         <line/>are we able to live at an inn, one of the most 
         <line/>respectable in the whole country, at the rate of 
         <line/>fifty pounds a year, while the pay of a common 
         <line/>farming man is not much short of that sum.

         <line/>which the friends of humanity have indulged ever

         <line/>Germany and Switzerland to America. We have

         <line/>tion of Governments, and it is with this view that 
         <line/>we think is our duty to make known the fate of 
         <line/>an expedition of this kind, fitted out at Amster<sh/>

         <line/>that the price of the passage be diminished or augmented as 
         <line/>much as shall be necessary, until we all and our families have 
         <line/>employment, and the captain be no loser by us ; knowing very 
         <line/>well that we passengers who have children, a family, brothers, 
         <line/>and sisters, ought all to sumbit to our wives or husbands, our 
         <line/>children, our brothers, our sisters, being sent separately to 
         <line/>whatever place, in order to gain, in private service, profession, 
         <line/>or labour, or in any manner that shall be deemed best, the 
         <line/>price of our passage ; and in order that we may not in any case 
         <line/>refused the engagements proposed to us, or contract others

         <line/>for those who have not yet paid for their passage, for those 
         <line/>who still owe part, and for those who cannot find an en<sh/>
         
         <line/>gagement, that they must consent to me, the captain, carrying 
         <line/>them to such place in America as it shall please me, and 
         <line/>wherever I may find it expedient to proceed, or wherever it 
         <line/>may suit me to sail."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"These horrible conditions were signed by 
         <line/>300 passengers. They had contracted with the 
         <line/>Captain of a Dutch ship, which was to proceed 
         <line/>first to Baltimore. She in the worst state 
         <line/>when she sailed from Amsterdam, and in de<sh/>
         
         <line/>fiance of the clauses of the contract, by which 
         <line/>the Captain had engaged to feed them properly 
         <line/>during the voyage, he had not even embarked 
         <line/>the necessary quanitity of provisions ; for, after 
         <line/>62 days navigation, the leaks had so gained upon 
         <line/>the ship, that she was in danger of sinking, and 
         <line/>famine had already made frightful ravages. It 
         <line/>was at the end of that time, and in this deplo 
         <line/>rable condition, that she was forced into Belem, 
         <line/>near Lisbon. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Long before her arrival on our coasts, the 
         <line/>passengers had been reduced to the greatest mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sery, not more by the small quantity than by the 
         <line/>bad quality of the provisions. The water was 
         <line/>gone, and sea-water was their only drink. So 
         <line/>much had they been wasted, that forty had al<sh/>
         
         <line/>ready died of famine. Among the rest there 
         <line/>were a great many sick, some of who have died 
         <line/>since their arrival in Portugal. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The situation of the vessel had at first given 
         <line/>great alarm to our Council of Health, who, ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>prehensive of contagion, were for an instant fear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful that it would be necessary to force her out 
         <line/>to sea. That would have been a misery so much 
         <line/>the more formidable, because the ship was not in 
         <line/>a state to keep the sea, and all must infallibly 
         <line/>have perished. Happily this was deemed unne<sh/>
         
         <line/>cessary, and a quarantine was ordered. The Re<sh/>
         
         <line/>gency of Lisbon determined that provisions and 
         <line/>other succours should be furnished at the ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pence of the State. All the Consuls were most 
         <line/>active and benevolent in affording assistance. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Such was the result of the expedition. 
         <line/>Many others have, no doubt, answered as little 
         <line/>the expectations of those who, seduced by de<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceitful promises have emigrated to America in 
         <line/>search of happiness which they could not find, 
         <line/>abandoning their country, their parents, and 
         <line/>their friends. In July, a Hamburgh ship, with 
         <line/>106 Swiss passengers, was at Lisbon, in nearly the 
         <line/>same distress with the Dutch ship. It is said 
         <line/>here that there is a company in Holland which 
         <line/>has numerous agents to seduce men to emigrate. 
         <line/>It heaps them pell mell on board ships, and if 
         <line/>they reach their destination, they are soon con<sh/>
         
         <line/>vinced of the fallacy of all their hopes. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"It would be a desirable thing for papers, in 
         <line/>countries where these emigrations are excited, 
         <line/>to insert the article relative to the charter par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty, given above, in order that the simple 
         <line/>and credulous may see what they have to un<sh/>

         <line/>Extract of a letter from the agent to 
         <line/>at the Cape of Good Hope, dated 15th Nov. 
         <line/>1817: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The following most daring instance of piracy 
         <line/>was committed in our harbour on the 11th inst. 
         <line/>viz.– The Elizabeth, White, lying at anchor off 
         <line/>Robin Island, with about 120 tons of oil on board, 
         <line/>was boarded at about one <small_caps>a. m.</small_caps> by a party of 
         <line/>armed deserters from his Majesty's 10th regi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, and convicts, about 12 in number, <i>i. e.</i>
         
         <line/>five soldiers and seven convicts, who, after se<sh/>
         
         <line/>curing the hatches, &amp;c. obtained possession of 
         <line/>the ship, and in the same instant cut the cables, 
         <line/>loosed the sails, and favoured by a strong S. E. 
         <line/>wind, succeeded in carrying her off, at six <small_caps>a.m.</small_caps>
         
         <line/>The captain and crew having refused to listen to 
         <line/>their invitation to join them in their piratical un<sh/>
         
         <line/>dertaking, with the exception of the mate, were 
         <line/>permitted to leave the ship in the boat, which 
         <line/>reached Robin Island in safety about four o'clock 
         <line/>the same day. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"By a letter received to-day we learn that 
         <line/>the Admiral Gambier, Brash, laden with Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment stores for Ceylon, was totally lost on the 
         <line/>morning of the 20th of June last, having struck 
         <line/>on the reef Roan de Nova, in the Mozambique 
         <line/>Channel ; crew saved."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>A letter from Halifax, dated the 27th No<sh/>
         
         <line/>nember, says – " Colonel Bouchette, Surveyor- 
         <line/>General of Lower Canada, with Captain Camp<sh/>
         
         <line/>bell, of the 60th regiment, and Mr Bouchette, 
         <line/>jun. arrived here on the 19th inst. The only in<sh/>
         
         <line/>formation I can yet give you is, that the exploring 
         <line/>survey has been extended from the source of the 
         <line/>St Croix river to the river Restigouche, in line 
         <line/>about 100 miles ; in this short distance both par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ties experienced difficulties and sufferings of the 
         <line/>severest nature. The Americans employed on 
         <line/>the same line with our English Commissioners 
         <line/>are represented as men of great ability, and act<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing with that spirit of liberality that infuses con<sh/>
         
         <line/>fidence on each side, rendering their arduous 
         <line/>task less severe and gloomy than was to have 
         <line/>been expected in thie untrodden wilds of this 
         <line/>quarter. Our trade continues dull, and money 
         <line/>scarce. Government bills are 3 per cent ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vance, but expected to be lower, in consequence 
         <line/>of the Commissary-General having refused to 
         <line/>take the provincial notes."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Fire in Sheerness Dock-Yard</small_caps>–On Friday 
         <line/>night, about half-past nine o'clock, this place 
         <line/>was thrown into the greatest consternation, by 
         <line/>the ringing of the alarm bells in the dock-yard, 
         <line/>the beating of drums, and the firing of the men 
         <line/>of war's guns. It was occasioned by a fire hav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing broken out in the house belonging to the 
         <line/>steam engine erected for carrying on the new 
         <line/>works situated in the southern part of the dock- 
         <line/>yard, near the kilns used for burning cement 
         <line/>stone. The most serious apprehensions were 
         <line/>entertained for the safety of the arsenal ; and 
         <line/>what was more distressing to the feelings of the 
         <line/>spectators, was its coniguity to the workhouse, 
         <line/>which, from the pressure of the times and want 
         <line/>of employment, is crowded with many unfortu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nate individuals. Providence, however, averted 
         <line/>the impending danger, and about twelve o'clock 
         <line/>we had the pleasure of seeing the raging flames 
         <line/>subdued, with only the loss of the engine-house. 
         <line/>No lives, it is understood, have been lost, but 
         <line/>one poor man is severely hurt. Captain Walker 
         <line/>of the Northumberland, and the officers of that 
         <line/>ship, Liutenant Griffin of the Swan cutter, and 
         <line/>Captain Brown and the officers of the Ordinary, 
         <line/>with the military officers and soldiers of the gar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rison, assembled on the first alarm. The latter 
         <line/>were under arms the whole time, and were of 
         <line/>great service in keeping off the spectators. The 
         <line/>inhabitants of the twon were at one time under 
         <line/>serious apprehensions, as the fire was not far 
         <line/>from the Fountain tavern, and the residence of 
         <line/>Mr Miller, in High Street. At the former, the 
         <line/>landlady of the house had but recently lain in, 
         <line/>and was removed on the first alarm being given. 
         <line/>Sir Robert Barlow, from Chatham, who superin<sh/>
         
         <line/>tends during the absence of Commissioner Boyle, 
         <line/>was here yesterday to investiage into the cause, 
         <line/>which it is suspected arose from carlessness – 
         <line/>The damage, however, has not been so great as 
         <line/>was at first expected, and which it might have been 
         <line/>but for the prompt and effectual assistance that 
         <line/>was given – <i>Sheerness, January</i> 11

         <line/>New York and other American papers have 
         <line/>been received to the 20th December: – In the 
         <line/>hosue of Representatives, on the 9th, Mr John<sh/>
         
         <line/>son brought forward a series of resolutions re<sh/>

         <line/>of which is the following: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"That the military peace establishment of the United 
         <line/>States shall consist hereafter of eight thousand men, including

         <line/>the General Staff and Ordnance Department shall be re<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained, as at present established. Provided also, that no part 
         <line/>of the army shall be disbanded in consequence of said re<sh/>
         
         <line/>duction, but the same shall be effected by permitting vacan<sh/>
         
         <line/>cies, as they occur, to remain – That it is expedient to pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vide by law for an additional national armoury, to be located 
         <line/>on the western waters. That it is expedient to organise by 
         <line/>law a corps of invalids, to be composed of one thousand 
         <line/>men."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>The following resolution relative to foreign

      <p>

         <line/>ever, is actually the situation of hundres who 
         <line/>annually land on our shores. To provide for 
         <line/>those forlorn beings, several attempts have been 
         <line/>made by associations of humane individuals here, 
         <line/>but nothing hitherto has appeared to promising 
         <line/>as that of which an account here follows: –

      <p>
         <line/>Upon the motion of Thomas Addis Emmett, 
         <line/>the circular previously issues on this subject was 
         <line/>read by the Secretary : –

         <line/>It is a sentiment long felt, and often express<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, that something should be undertaken on be<sh/>
         
         <line/>hald of the emigrants who flock to these shores. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Without any fixed destination, they remain in 
         <line/>the sea port, until beocming victims of bad 
         <line/>counsel and bad example, they lose the pure and 
         <line/>honest energies with which they left their native 
         <line/>land, and suffer worse than shipwreck in their 
         <line/>moral qualities. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Government of this great Republic is well 
         <line/>aware of the advantage to be derived from so 
         <line/>great a mass of laborious industry, when usefully 
         <line/>directed and employed–and of adding to the 
         <line/>nation's strength, men whose attachment to the 
         <line/>institutions of this country is assured by so many 
         <line/>ties. But it is in the order of things, that some 
         <line/>of the friends, particularly the countrymen of 
         <line/>these emigrants, who have been some time esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blished and known, should come forward to at<sh/>
         
         <line/>test the necessity, and guarantee the solidity of 
         <line/>the enterprise. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>If his has not been done sooner, it is because 
         <line/>every advance in social improvement must come 
         <line/>in its season. it is the ripeness of the occasion, 
         <line/>and the voice of the times that now speak. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It has been remarked that among the lands 
         <line/>nows open for sale and settlement, there are some 
         <line/>tracks, particularly in the Illionois territory, 
         <line/>where the Irish emigrant, with the instruments 
         <line/>to which his hands are accustomed, and in a cli<sh/>
         
         <line/>mate congenial to his habits, might procure to 
         <line/>himself immediate shelter and subsistence–and, 
         <line/>in a few years, be able to repay with gratitude 
         <line/>the benefits conferred on him. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We, whose names are undersigned, have met 
         <line/>to consult upon the means of promoting some 
         <line/>establishment that might be a rallying point for 
         <line/>the distressed, and give to the wanderer a habi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tation and a home. We have thought of no bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter way than to address, by this circular, the 
         <line/>friends and well wishers of Ireland, who co-ope<sh/>
         
         <line/>ration might give most weight to the measure, 
         <line/>and to submit, whether it might not be advisable 
         <line/>to join all our efforts, and petition Congress ear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly in the ensuing session, for a grant of a suit<sh/>
         
         <line/>able track, upon a credit of 14 or 15 years, sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject to such conditions and modifications as the 
         <line/>Government may see most fitting. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>to the Government we would offer no decep<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive, delusive, or precarious motive, rather chu<sh/>
         
         <line/>sing to make its wisdom, benignity, and patriot<sh/>
         
         <line/>ism, the anchor of our hope. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We request of our, if you approve of our sen<sh/>
         
         <line/>timent and of our project, to advance and pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>mote it by your best endeavours ; either by form<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing organized associations, or by obtaining indi<sh/>
         
         <line/>vidual signatures, to a petition to the effect sta<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted. We have not yet been able to digest a plan, 
         <line/>and have rather chosen to make this humble be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ginning, in hopes that we should soon receive 
         <line/>additional light upon the subject from cor<sh/>
         
         <line/>respondence we solicit. We shall, nevertheless, 
         <line/>proceed to investigate the subject, and challenge 
         <line/>the co-operation of good and respectable men, 
         <line/>and request of you to do the same.

      <p>
         <line/>Mr Emmet then stated, that he had been re<sh/>
         
         <line/>quested by the gentlemen who called this meet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, to explain the objects for which it was con<sh/>
         
         <line/>venued ; that it could not be necessary to expa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tiate before those he was now addressin, on the 
         <line/>situation of the peasantry and farmers in Ire<sh/>
         
         <line/>land ; it was at present one of unqualified mise<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, partly occasioned by their local oppressions, 
         <line/>and partly by the general calamities of Europe ; 
         <line/>it compelled them to fly to these shores in such 
         <line/>numbers, and under the pressure of so great po<sh/>
         
         <line/>verty, that the most active individual benevo<sh/>
         
         <line/>levence could neither provide them with a sufficient 
         <line/>present succour, nor procure for them, within a 
         <line/>reasonable time, the means of permanent settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. The consequence was, that many of 
         <line/>those unfortunate strangers were totally lost to 
         <line/>this county, or forced by want to become noxi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ous and dangerous to its cities, whose original 
         <line/>dispositions and qualifications, if rightly direct<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed and employed, would have made them valu<sh/>
         
         <line/>able and useful members of the community. Be<sh/>
         
         <line/>sides, the accounts transmitted back to Ireland 
         <line/>of their disappointments and destitute situations, 
         <line/>deferred many who were suffering at home the 
         <line/>extreme of wretchedness, from endeavouring to 
         <line/>better their condition in this more fortunate and 
         <line/>favoured land–to the political institutions of 
         <line/>which they were also more strongly attached. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A very painful reflection on these circumstan<sh/>
         
         <line/>ces had suggested to come gentlemen then pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sent the hope that the general Government might 
         <line/>be induced, by a strong and united application, 
         <line/>to grant a portion of its unsettled lands on terms 
         <line/>liberal and bountiful, so that an asylum might be 
         <line/>formed for industrious and enterprising farmers, 
         <line/>who would gladly fly from famine and persecu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to a spot where the sweat of their brows fall<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing on a fertile soil would yield them a rich har<sh/>
         
         <line/>vest, for their own exclusive benefit, and where 
         <line/>they might peacefully enjoy all the blessings of 
         <line/>that republication liberty they loved. The time 
         <line/>for making such an application seemed auspici<sh/>
         
         <line/>ous ; party asperities had softened fown, and 
         <line/>probably few would now be led by political pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>judices to give it opposition. Neither was it un<sh/>
         
         <line/>precedented ; a favour nearly similar had been 
         <line/>granted to the French emigrants, and to settlers 
         <line/>from Switzerland. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is true we could not forth a pretence 
         <line/>like the cultivation of the vine or the olive ; and 
         <column/>
         <line/>we would not succeed by practising any delusion. 
         <line/>We could offer nothing but an immediate accession 
         <line/>of industrious and hardy settlers, who in a conge<sh/>
         
         <line/>nial soil and climate would become enthusiastically 
         <line/>attached to the country and the Government 
         <line/>from whence they derived all their blessings, and, 
         <line/>wherever they were found, would form a barrier 
         <line/>against every enemy. Much might undoubtedly 
         <line/>be expected from the generous sympathy which 
         <line/>the sorrows and sufferings of Ireland had every<sh/>
         
         <line/>where excited in the United States, and from 
         <line/>the acknowledged liberality of its Constituted 
         <line/>Authorities ; but very forcible arguments might 
         <line/>also be addressed to its policy and interest. Not 
         <line/>only those that in the ordinary course of events 
         <line/>would arrive here, whose usefulness is lost by 
         <line/>the want of proper direction, and who become 
         <line/>burdens or scourges to our cities, would be res<sh/>
         
         <line/>cued and placed in a situation where all the ener<sh/>
         
         <line/>gies of active and enterprising minds would be 
         <line/>serviceable to themselves and the community ; 
         <line/>but also the very fact that such an asylum was 
         <line/>open and accessible, would infinitely increase 
         <line/>the amount of emigration from Ireland, and peo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ple our wildernesses with incalculable rapidity. 
         <line/>The place upon which we have fixed our eyes is 
         <line/>in the Illinois territory–it has been lately pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>chased, and is not yet even surveyed. In the 
         <line/>ordinary course of events, it is not likely to be 
         <line/>brought into market (at least to any extent) for 
         <line/>many years ; but if Congress listen to our ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>plication, and grant to the settlers an extended 
         <line/>credit, Government will receive payment for the 
         <line/>land probably as soon as if it were suffered to 
         <line/>remain unheeded till its regular turn for sale 
         <line/>came round. A large body of settlers will be 
         <line/>enabled to grow rich during the time that the 
         <line/>land would otherwise be waste and unproduc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive, and the value of all the contiguous proper<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty belonging to the United States would be ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>pidly and immensely increased, to say nothing 
         <line/>of the advantages resulting from the strength of 
         <line/>such a settled frontier. All these considerations 
         <line/>may be strongly urged by men, who can most 
         <line/>truly say they are actuated by no views of 
         <line/>personal speculation or emolument ; who are 
         <line/>willing to enter into all the labour of procuring 
         <line/>settlers and organising the establishment, with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out any prospect of gain, or even compensation, 
         <line/>except as to what may be necessary for defray<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the expences of the undertaking ; and who 
         <line/>are desirous that the actual settlers should enjoy 
         <line/>all the advantages which Government may be 
         <line/>willing to grant. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>These are our views–we conceive that they 
         <line/>may be realized, if supported by an united and 
         <line/>active co-operation of those who think like us 
         <line/>in other parts of the Union. We are, therefore, 
         <line/>desirous of adopting and pointing out to others 
         <line/>what seems to be the best mode of giving system 
         <line/>to that co-operation ; namely, the formation of 
         <line/>societies totally divested of all party or political 
         <line/>feelings, and directing the attention only to this 
         <line/>object. There are already a sufficient number 
         <line/>of political institutions in every State, in which 
         <line/>the zealous partizan (be his opinions what they 
         <line/>may) can act on them to their fullest extent. 
         <line/>Let these societies be neutral groun, or rather 
         <line/>consecrated places, in which, when we meet, we 
         <line/>lay aside all our hostilities, and join as brothers 
         <line/>in our prayers and offerings at the shrine of our 
         <line/>common worship. They are consecrated to 
         <line/>every man amongst us, by the purity of their 
         <line/>object, by our earliest recollections, by our un<sh/>
         
         <line/>broken affection, and our strongest sympathies– 
         <line/>by the unextinguished love of our native land, 
         <line/>for which most of us have already renounced all 
         <line/>sectarian antipathies and religious animosities ; 
         <line/>which we offer as a solemn pledge to the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try of our adoption, that our hearts will be al<sh/>
         
         <line/>ways alive, from temperament as well as prin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciple, to the emotions of patriotism ; and that 
         <line/>those amongst us who have pledged their faith 
         <line/>to her, however they may seem to differ on some 
         <line/>minor political subjects, will always be found 
         <line/>firmly ranged and united under the same ban<sh/>
         
         <line/>ners, and forming one phalanx whenever her 
         <line/>more important interests are concerned. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Emmet then moved four resolutions, which 
         <line/>being severally put, were carried with some 
         <line/>slight amendments as follow :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>1. Resolved–That it is expedient to form a Society of 
         <line/>Irishmen and descendents of Irishmen, for the purpose of en<sh/>
         
         <line/>deavouring to procure from Congress a track of land in the 
         <line/>Illinois territory, to be settled by emigrants from Ireland. 
         <line/>2. Resolved–That every person of the foregoing descrip<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, who shall, on or before the second day of December 
         <line/>next, pay to the Secretary of this Meeting the sum of five 
         <line/>dollars, shall be entitled to become a Member of the said So<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciety, until the number of subscribers shall have amounted to 
         <line/>one hundred, after which time the subscribers shall be at li<sh/>
         
         <line/>berty to elect their own officers and no person shall after<sh/>
         
         <line/>wards be admitted except by ballot. 
         <line/>3. Resolved–That it be recommended in Irishmen, and 
         <line/>the descendents of Irishmen, in the other cities and towns of 
         <line/>the Union, to form similar societies for the purpose of cor<sh/>
         
         <line/>responding and co-operating with that which is about to be 
         <line/>formed in this city. 
         <line/>4. Resolved–That, as the meeting of Congress will short<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly take place, and in order to prevent the less of time, a Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mittee of fifteen be appointed to prepare the outlines of a me<sh/>
         
         <line/>morial to that body, to be submitted to the consideration of the 
         <line/>Society, when formed and organized ; and also to adopt such 
         <line/>measures as they may think expedient for promoting and ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>celebrating the organization of that Society. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr John W. Mulligan, in seconding Mr Em<sh/>
         
         <line/>met's motion, expressed, in handsome terms, how 
         <line/>much he was gratified by the invitation to attend, 
         <line/>had given him the opportunity of claiming 
         <line/>his title of descendent of an Irishman. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A Committee was then appointed, pursuant 
         <line/>to the fourth resolution, the number being, upon 
         <line/>motion and discussion, augmented to twenty<sh/>
         
         <line/>one.

      <p>
         <line/>A subscription paper being then opened, a 
         <line/>number of those present subscribed their names 
         <line/>and paid five dollars as their initiation fee, and

         <line/>
            <i>their Correspondents in this quarter.</i>

         <line/>"We sincerely hope that the Duties Government had in con<sh/>
         
         <line/>templation (last year) to impose upon Timber imported into 
         <line/>Great Britain and Ireland, from the British North American 
         <line/>Provinces, equal to the additional duty imposed on Foreign 
         <line/>Timber in 1813 will be further suspended. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Our[?] commercial system chiefly depends upon the encourage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of the Timber branch ; ships that carry away that article[?] 
         <line/>bring us [?] at a low freight, whereby we are enabled to furnish 
         <line/>the British West India Islands with an abundant supply of Fish[?], 
         <line/>and that on very moderate terms ; but, in the event of Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment persisting in imposing the Duty on Timber from hence, 
         <line/>that branch of our trade will inevitably revert to the Americans, 
         <line/>besides being the ruin of many in this and in the neighbouring 
         <line/>Provinces. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The supposed revenue that would accrue to the mother 
         <line/>country, upon trial, will be found delusive ; to prove this, many 
         <line/>obvious[?] reasons can be adduced : As the trade now exists, all the 
         <line/>Timber extracted from these Colonies to Great Britain and Ire<sh/>
         
         <line/>land is paid for in British Manufactures ; the export of so bulky 
         <line/>an article as Timber, and the import of so ponderous an article 
         <line/>as [?], employs[?] an immense number of British ships ; objects 
         <line/>certainly of more real value to the revenue of Britain than any 
         <line/>benefit they could possibly derive from direct Duties imposed on 
         <line/>the export of Timber from British North America. It cannot be 
         <line/>denied that previous to 1813, when the additional Duty was laid 
         <line/>on Foreign Timber, they (the Foreigners) were not only the 
         <line/>carriers, but would not accept an ounce of British Manufac<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture in payment for their TImber–no, nothing but you gold[?] 
         <line/>which was so much in demand, that 28s. was given for a [?]. 
         <line/>Another very cogent reason [?] be advanced in favour of what 
         <line/>is commonly denominated the Timber Trade from these Provin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ces ; it facilitates emigration, and introduces many valuable set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlers into this Province, and the Canadas, that would go to the 
         <line/>States of America ; and the day is perhaps not so far distant when 
         <line/>they would of accessity[?] become our enemies. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"When Great Britain was first involved in war with the eas<sh/>
         
         <line/>tern countries, from whence the principal supply of Timber was 
         <line/>derived, the merchants in that line[?], as well as the ship-masters 
         <line/>were not only alarmed, but convinced themselves ruined ! The 
         <line/>Baltic is shut[?], what shall we do for Timber, and with our ships? 
         <line/>They properly concluded that perhaps the British Provinces could 
         <line/>supply them ; they made the experiment, they were not disap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointed–but succeeded far beyond their expectations. If there<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore, in time of war, Britain has took to her colonies for a sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>ply of such a necessary article as Wood ; it is not reasonable for 
         <line/>us to conclude that their interests will not be wholly neglected, 
         <line/>when blessed with peace."

         <line/>Papers from Upper Canada contain the draft 
         <line/>of a petition to the Prince Regent, founded on 
         <line/>the resolutions adopted in the province of Nia<sh/>
         
         <line/>gara, where some discontent has been manifested. 
         <line/>The first part is as follows:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"To his Royal Highness George Prince of Wales, Regent 
         <line/>of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, 
         <line/>&amp;c. the humble Address of the Inhabitants of Upper 
         <line/>Canada 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <i>May it please your Royal Highness,</i>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The subjects of your Royal Father, dwelling in Upper 
         <line/>Canada, should need no words to give assurance of their 
         <line/>loyalty, if the whole truth had reached the throne of their 
         <line/>Sovereign. His subjects have reason to believe that the truth 
         <line/>has not been told. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>During three years of war, Upper Canada was exposed 
         <line/>to the ravages of a powerful and inveterate foe. The Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment of the United States had been long concerting the 
         <line/>invasion of this province. Hostile preparations against it had 
         <line/>been long masked under other designs ; and at last the ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>cumulated torrent of violence burst on the defencless chil<sh/>
         
         <line/>dren of the British empire. Nor were they assailed by the 
         <line/>weapons of war alone ; an invidious proclamation preceded 
         <line/>those host of the enemy, forgetful of honour, regardless of hu<sh/>
         
         <line/>manity, and daring to seduce the subjects of Britain from 
         <line/>their true allegiance. The subjects of Britain remained 
         <line/>dauntless and firm. It was not for their property that they 
         <line/>rose against their invaders ; the invader would have spared to 
         <line/>them their property. They flew to arms in defence of the 
         <line/>rights and sovereignty of Britain. Twice has the American 
         <line/>standard been planted in Upper Canada, while yet but a hand<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful of British troops aided the native battalions wave the laurel of 
         <line/>victory over the protrate intruders on their soil. The se<sh/>
         
         <line/>cond year of war saw Canada contending with yet little as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sistance from the parent state. The second year of the war 
         <line/>saw her sons confirmed in their virtue, and still more deter<sh/>
         
         <line/>mined to resist. Wives and children had fled from their 
         <line/>homes ; the face of the country was laid waste, and the fire of 
         <line/>revenge was sent forth to consummate distress and misery ; 
         <line/>still was the spirit of the people unextinguished, still did it 
         <line/>burn with patriotism and loyalty. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"By the third year every risk of conquest was at an end, for 
         <line/>now the British aid poured into the provinces, and peace 
         <line/>was proclaimed when war was no longer to be feared. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"It is now more than three years since there was an end 
         <line/>of war, but, strange to say, these years of peace have ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nifested no appearance of affection or care from the mother 
         <line/>country to the Canadas. Commercial treaties have been 
         <line/>made, altogether neglectful of British interests here. Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment transactions, which used to give spirit to trade and 
         <line/>are at a stand; troops are withdrawn ; fortifications 
         <line/>are suffered to go to ruin ; and rumours are abroad too 
         <line/>shocking to be repeated in the Royal ear. May it please 
         <line/>your Royal Highness to listen calmly to the complains and 
         <line/>grievances of the people of Upper Canada who are fully 
         <line/>assured that your Royal Highness has been kept ignorant of 
         <line/>most important truths ; who are well assured of the gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>rous disposition of your Royal heart, and of your desire that 
         <line/>British subjects should every where share equally you pater<sh/>
         
         <line/>nal regard an affection. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"It was a matter of much provocation to the people of 
         <line/>the province to see, even during the war, which afforded 
         <line/>such striking proofs of their loyalty and valour, reports 
         <line/>went home highly rating the merits of regular troops, 
         <line/>while the tribute due to Canadian levies were unfairly set 
         <line/>down, may, the principles of the most loyal subjects here 
         <line/>were often stigmatised by British officers, ignorant of 
         <line/>human character, and still more so of circumstances 
         <line/>which affect it in this part of the world. It was not so 
         <line/>with the immortal Brock. He justly appreciated Cana<sh/>
         
         <line/>dian worth, and his memory will happily long cherish, in 
         <line/>the minds of the Canadian people, a due regard for the 
         <line/>genuine spirit of a British solider, at once generous and 
         <line/>brave. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The loyal inhabitants of Upper Canada would disdain 
         <line/>to notice the misrepresentations of individuals, so contrary 
         <line/>to notorious truth, if these had not obviously conspired with 
         <line/>other causes to lessen the regard which should subsist be<sh/>
         
         <line/>tween British subjects here and at home, to influence the 
         <line/>conduct of Ministers towards the general interests of the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vince. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The loyal subjects of his Majesty in Upper Canada 
         <line/>suffered grievously during the war in their property, and 
         <line/>many were bereft of their all. A solemn investigation on 
         <line/>this subject took place ; the claims of the sufferers were au<sh/>
         
         <line/>thenticated, and there was every reason to expect that re<sh/>
         
         <line/>compence would immediately follow ; yet nothing has fol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lowed but delay and insult. Surely if there is among mankind 
         <line/>a single principle of justice, that is one, that the individuals 
         <line/>of a nation ought not, partially, to bear the weight of public 
         <line/>calamity. Surely individuals who have exposed their lives 
         <line/>for Government should not be disgusted with finding Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment regardless of those very principles which it is in<sh/>
         
         <line/>tended to sustain. The people of this province are well 
         <line/>aware that their fellow subjects at home are pressed hard 
         <line/>with taxations, and far it is from their wish that relief 
         <line/>should be afford from thence. Canada contains within it<sh/>
         
         <line/>self ample means of exonerating Government from the 
         <line/>claims of sufferers by war ; and it is within the fiat[?] of your 
         <line/>Royal Highness to remove, by a signle breath, the evil now 
         <line/>justly complained of. Millions of acres of fertile lands lie 
         <line/>here at the disposal of your Royal Highness, upon the credit 
         <line/>of which, under proper management, not only the fair claims 
         <line/>of loyal sufferers could be instantly advanced, but vast sums 
         <line/>could be raised for the improvement of the provinces, and 
         <line/>the increase of revenue to Britain. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Another grievance, manifesting the neglect of Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment to the concerns of Upper Canada, is equally notorious, 
         <line/>and must be still more abhorrent to the general feelings of 
         <line/>your Royal Highness. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The young men of this province, who were armed in 
         <line/>its defence had, for their spirited conduct, the promise of 
         <line/>their commanders, that land would be granted them as a 
         <line/>reward for their services, as soon as war was terminated ; 
         <line/>and after this promise was universaly confided in the Parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of Upper Canada passed an extraordinary law, in the face 
         <line/>of established British principles, that militia should pass 
         <line/>beyond the frontier. With these promises, and in obedience 
         <line/>to this law, the militia passed beyond the frontier with 
         <line/>alacrity ; yet since the peace, the greater part of them had 
         <line/>been denied the pledge of their extraordinary services, and 
         <line/>the land is unjudtly withheld."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The petition further states that such ingratitude, 
         <line/>such dishonour, such errors in policy, could not 
         <line/>exist without extraordinary influences, and it 
         <line/>recommends most important changes equally for 
         <line/>the glory of the throne, and benefit of the 
         <line/>subject. It says that the scandalous abuses came 
         <line/>some years ago to such a pitch of monstrous in<sh/>
         
         <line/>gratitude, the the home Ministers wisely im<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed restriction on the Land Council of Upper 
         <line/>Canada. It seems, however, that all this was 
         <line/>insufficient, and that confusion on confusion has 
         <line/>grown out of this unhappy system. Upper Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>nada, it is now said, pines in comparative de<sh/>
         
         <line/>cay, and that discontent and poverty are expe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rienced in a land supremely blessed with the 
         <line/>gifts of nature. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is insisted that the immediate interfe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rence of his Royal Highness might do 
         <line/>much to remove the evils which spring from the 
         <line/>system of patronage and favouritism, and it as<sh/>
         
         <line/>serts that the interposition of the British Par<sh/>
         
         <line/>liament is more imperiously required. It con<sh/>
         
         <line/>cludes as follows:–" Deeply penetrated with 
         <line/>these sentiments, and most seriously inclined to 
         <line/>have changes speedily effected, the loyal 
         <line/>subjects of Great Britain dwelling in Upper 
         <line/>Canada now take the extraordinary step of send<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing home Commissioners to bear this to the 
         <line/>throne, and humbly intreat your Royal High<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness to give ear to the details which it will be in 
         <line/>their power to relate: above all, that your Royal

         <line/>"The seizure, trial, and execution of two 
         <line/>men, said to be British subjects, by our military 
         <line/>folks, who lately invaded, the Spanish Territory, 
         <line/>seems to be confirmed by accounts from the 
         <line/>south, with a lament added thereto, that another 
         <line/>of the same nation had not been catched and 
         <line/>killed. If these accounts should prove true, I 
         <line/>think the President will as good reason for 
         <line/>recommending to Congress, at the next session, 
         <line/>the abolition of the army, as he had at the last, 
         <line/>for doing away the naval forces on the lakes– 
         <line/>because it was more likely to involve us in war, 
         <line/>than to give us security and peace. A little 
         <line/>while ago we made quite a bluster and noise be<sh/>
         
         <line/>cause the King of Spain had imprisoned one of 
         <line/>our citizens at Cadiz; but the nation seems to 
         <line/>rest very easy at present with the above named 
         <line/>executions. Why?–because the wrong is com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted by us, not against us."/&gt;

         <line/>Extract of a letter, dated Washington city, 
         <line/>June 2. 1818:–" The British Consul-General, 
         <line/>A. St. John Baker, is about to depart for Eu<sh/>
         
         <line/>rope; the ostensible cause of his departure is the 
         <line/>recovery of his health, but it is sufficient to look 
         <line/>in his face to see that it is only a common diplo<sh/>
         
         <line/>matic disease, which may be aggravated or cured 
         <line/>at discretion ; the real object is diplomatic ; the 
         <line/>English Cabinet has expressed some hesitation 
         <line/>in regard to certain subjects in Mr Bagot's dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>patches ; the speculation carrying on between the 
         <line/>Spanish agents and some persons in this place 
         <line/>opens a field of corruption so wide and compre<sh/>
         
         <line/>hensive. Mr Baker goes prepared to state the facts,

         <line/>Washington, May 25, 1818. 
         <line/>SIR–The act of Congress, "concerning navigation," hereto 
         <line/>annexed, which is to take effect the first day of October 
         <line/>next, so materially changes the commerce of the United 
         <line/>States with the colonies and territories of Britannic Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>jesty, thata due regard to the convenience and interest of 
         <line/>those engaged in it requires that the construction of the act 
         <line/>should at this time be determined. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>According to the term used un ther the first section of the 
         <line/>act, every port or place in the British colonies and territories 
         <line/>in the West Indies, and on the continent of America, must 
         <line/>be considered as closed against vessels of the United States, 
         <line/>to which they are not by act of Parliament permitted to carry 
         <line/>on the same trade, both in exports and imports, which is 
         <line/>now, or shall be, carried on in British vessels between the 
         <line/>ports of the United States and the ports of any British colony 
         <line/>or territory. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The permissions by act of Parliament to vessels of the 
         <line/>United States to go in ballast to Turk's Island, and bring 
         <line/>away salt, or to carry certain articles to one or more of the 
         <line/>Bahama Islands, and bring away salt, and a few other ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticles, cannot be considered as opening the ports of those 
         <line/>islands to the vessels of the United States, according to the 
         <line/>intention of the act of Congress, whilst British vessels are 
         <line/>permitted to carry on the same trade in articles prohibited to 
         <line/>vessels of the United States. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It may be proper to observe, that the prohibition in the 
         <line/>first section applies equally to vessels whether in ballast or 
         <line/>with cargoes. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The form of the bond required by the second section of 
         <line/>the act is hereunto annexed. It is expected that proper cir<sh/>
         
         <line/>cumspection will be exercised in requiring a security, as much 
         <line/>of the efficacy of the act will depend upon the judicious dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>charge of this part of your duty.

            <small_caps>Emigration to America</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our paper of Thursday last contained a gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>ral view of some of the most popular publications 
         <line/>on the subject of emigration, and we shall now 
         <line/>endeavour briefly to make an estimate of the 
         <line/>good and evil which is likely to befal those who 
         <line/>embark in this hazardous adventure. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There is one important fact which we gather 
         <line/>from all the accounts of America, whether writ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ten for the purpose of praise or censure, namely, 
         <line/>that there is a great demand for labour, and that 
         <line/>wages are high, and this effect is necessarily 
         <line/>produced y the vast space of fertile and unoc<sh/>
         
         <line/>cupied territory which lies westward of the 
         <line/>United States towards the Pacific Ocean. It is 
         <line/>this vacant territory which is the true spring of 
         <line/>this American community. Here is the grand out<sh/>
         
         <line/>let for the superflouous population both of the east<sh/>
         
         <line/>ern states of America and of Europe. To cultivate 
         <line/>this waste there is a constant demand for new la<sh/>
         
         <line/>bourers ; wages are, of course, high – the labourer 
         <line/>lives in comfort, and, if he is industrious, he be<sh/>
         
         <line/>comes in his turn a purchaser of land from the sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>vings which he accumulates. If labour should be<sh/>
         
         <line/>come more plentiful, and wages should fall, this is 
         <line/>the signal for new emigrations ; and thus, this con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stant demand for labour in the western districts 
         <line/>regulates its general price throughout the United 
         <line/>States. In these circumstrances it is clear that 
         <line/>a labourer, provided he can reach this advan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tageous market for his labour, will unquestionably 
         <line/>improve his condition. But herein lies the dif<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficulty. A labourer has seldon the means of 
         <line/>of subsitence so far beforehand as to enable him to 
         <line/>undertake so long a journey ; and, if he enters 
         <line/>upon the enterprise with insufficient means, he 
         <line/>is liable to starve before he can transport him<sh/>
         
         <line/>self to his ultimate destination, or he is forced to 
         <line/>contract, for immediate subsistence, obligations 
         <line/>little short of servitude, under the weight of 
         <line/>which he is grievously oppressed. These, then 
         <line/>form strong objections to emigrations in the case 
         <line/>of those who are stinted to their means ; but 
         <line/>where these objections can be surmounted, those 
         <line/>who can transport their labour from the over<sh/>
         
         <line/>stocked market of Europe to the understocked 
         <line/>market of America, will unquestionably dispose 
         <line/>of it to better advantage ; but if they have not 
         <line/>the means, they may as furely fail in the at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tempt, and draw upon themselves aggravated mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sery and want. As to the consequences of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration to this country, we hold them rather to be 
         <line/>beneficial than otherwise, and we cannot easily ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count for the very absurd alarm which has been 
         <line/>propagated on this subject. The evil in Europe is, 
         <line/>that every country is overcrowded with labourers, 
         <line/>who cannot find employment ; and is it not mani<sh/>
         
         <line/>fest, therefore, that the withdrawing of some of 
         <line/>these will make more room for the labourers that 
         <line/>remain – that the loss of those useless hands 
         <line/>will rather be a relief to the body politic, and 
         <line/>will diffuse greater soundness and vigour through 
         <line/>all its parts? That these effects will follow from 
         <line/>emigration in this or in any other country in 
         <line/>Europe we cannot doubt – and that the labourer, 
         <line/>if he can afford the expence of the jounrye, will re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceive higher wages in America than in this coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, is equally clear. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There is another class of adventurers who 
         <line/>may possibly improve their circumstances by 
         <line/>emigration, although this is not so certain, name<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly, farmers with a moderate capital. An allot<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of land may be purchased in the back parts 
         <line/>of America at the Government price of two dol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lars per acre, and an emigrant who can afford to 
         <line/>but and to cultivate 100 or 200 acres, and 
         <line/>acts with proper judgement and skill, may 
         <line/>undoubtedly, by a speculation of this sort, be sure 
         <line/>of a subsistence, while, by the continued emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions from the eastern states, the country being 
         <line/>quickly settled all around him, his property is 
         <line/>daily improving in value. But a want of judgement 
         <line/>in the purchase, or a want of ability to cultivate the 
         <line/>land after it is purchased, may involve him in ir<sh/>
         
         <line/>recoverable distress and ruin ; and to avoid these 
         <line/>hazards no little discrimination and prudence is 
         <line/>necessary. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Such are some of the most striking advantages 
         <line/>of emigration, and we shall now state some of 
         <line/>its disadvantages. The first, and chief of these, 
         <line/>is the difficulty of effecting a settlement, and of 
         <line/>subsisting until the land which is purchased yields 
         <line/>its first produce. The country is partly open 
         <line/>ground, or prairie, as it is called, or it is co<sh/>
         
         <line/>vered with almost boundless forests. A settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment in the woods requires incredible labour to 
         <line/>clear it – labour is dear, and not easily procured, 
         <line/>and this herculean task naturally devolves on the 
         <line/>head of the family, who is forced during the day 
         <line/>to ply the axe in this laborious drudgery of fell<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing trees, and afterwards to follow the chace for 
         <line/>a meal to his family. Here he must frequently 
         <line/>sleep out in the woods ; and his body, exhausted 
         <line/>with his day's labour, is exposed to the cold 
         <line/>dews of night ; under such unintermitted toil his 
         <line/>health declines, and it is obvious that his family, 
         <line/>deprived even for a single day of his exertions, 
         <line/>must be reduced to the most deplorable straits. 
         <line/>In many parts the country which is marked out 
         <line/>for emigrants is extremely unhealthy, in particu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar the banks of all the navigable rivers, which 
         <line/>afford the most eligible settlements both in point 
         <line/>of fertility and situation, are exposed to the most 
         <line/>fatal maladies. The same causes which produce 
         <line/>fertility produce disease. The overflowing of 
         <line/>the waters, from the autumnal and spring floods, 
         <line/>fertilise the land in a most wonderful degree ; 
         <line/>but the exhalations of these stagnant waters, un<sh/>
         
         <line/>der a burning sun, are as fatal to the health as 
         <line/>the deposits which they leave are favourable to 
         <line/>the soil. Hence the many minute directions 
         <line/>which are given to all emigrants in regard to 
         <line/>their health. In a letter contained in the Emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grant's Guide, we have the following advice to 
         <line/>those who are descending the Ohio : " If the 
         <line/>weather becomes warm, guard well against the 
         <line/>smell of bilge water. But if you must descend in 
         <line/>the spring, go early – avoid all delay, and remem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber you are fleeing for your lives. I have seen the 
         <line/>havoc, and I believed it not till then." Again it 
         <line/>is observed, " Let nothing tempt you to fish in 
         <line/>warm weather, immediately on changing your 
         <line/>climate. The effluvia of the shores is poison."/&gt;
         <line/>To a European emigran the climate must be, of 
         <line/>course, even more fatal ; and he either therefore 
         <line/>lose his health, or he must be continually 
         <line/>tormented with anxiously taking care of it, which 
         <line/>makes it a question whether it is worth having on 
         <line/>such terms. Such are the hardships through which, 
         <line/>if he has strength to endure them, he at length 
         <line/>emerges into ease and independence. These hard<sh/>
         
         <line/>ships, however, will no doubt be in a great mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sure avoided, or at least mitigated, if he has be<sh/>
         
         <line/>forehand provided the means of subsistence until 
         <line/>he can derive regular supplies from his own 
         <line/>land. In this case he is less laible to be 
         <line/>dislodged from his situation by the casualties to 
         <line/>which all emigrants are necessarily exposed. – 
         <line/>He is secured against the hardships of a first 
         <line/>settlement, and is more certain of attaining 
         <column/>
         <line/>the wished for object of ease and affluence – 
         <line/>To a farmer, therefore, or a labourer, emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion presents a fair chance of a permanent settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, provided it is gone about with ordinary 
         <line/>caution, and the necessary degree of energy be 
         <line/>exerted to insure success. But it is a gross de<sh/>
         
         <line/>lusion to imagine that an elysium is to be found in 
         <line/>the United States, or that mankind exist there on 
         <line/>any more favourable terms than in this country, 
         <line/>and those who set out on any such visionary 
         <line/>schemes are sure to meet with a woeful disappoint<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. With regard to other classes of society, it 
         <line/>does not appear that they will improve their con<sh/>
         
         <line/>dition by emigration to America ; there is no de<sh/>
         
         <line/>mand for clerks or professional men of any sort, 
         <line/>and no merchant has any thing to expect by remo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ving his capital to the United States. In the back 
         <line/>settlements there is a demand for schoolmasters 
         <line/>to teach the ordinary branches of education, and 
         <line/>several emigrants of this class have met with 
         <line/>good encouragement. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In regard to the essential article of comfort, it 
         <line/>is apparent, from all the best information on the 
         <line/>subject, that a person long resident in this coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try would change for the worse by an emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to the United States. He would, in the 
         <line/>first place, suffer extremely from the climate, from 
         <line/>the extreme cold of winter and the raging heat 
         <line/>of summer, the thermometer frequently standing 
         <line/>at 98 degrees in the share, with a clear sky and 
         <line/>broiling sun, and very little abatement of this ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>sessive heat being experienced through the night. 
         <line/>His frame, accustomed to the more temperate, 
         <line/>though unsettled climate of this country, 
         <line/>runs the risk of being debilitated by the change, 
         <line/>and at all events he must suffer extremely in 
         <line/>his enjoyments and in his spirit from this 
         <line/>cause. Nor, we should imagine, would the man<sh/>
         
         <line/>ners of the people in the back parts be found 
         <line/>very agreeable or polished. It is admitted on all 
         <line/>hands, both by those who are favourable and 
         <line/>those who are unfavourable to the Americans, 
         <line/>that if there is not, as in Europe, gross igno<sh/>
         
         <line/>rance and debasement on the one hand, neither 
         <line/>is there on the other any thing much exalted 
         <line/>above the ordinary level. But the inferences 
         <line/>which arise from this established fact are strongly 
         <line/>in favour of Europe. The grossness of vice and 
         <line/>ignorance carries a sure antidote to its corrup<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions in the disgust which it excites : such 
         <line/>examples are not so potent to debase, as ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>amples of a different sort are to purify and 
         <line/>exalt. There is little risk that society will 
         <line/>be contaminated by what is low and deba<sh/>
         
         <line/>sed ; but on the other hand, there is a cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tainty that what is exalted and illustrious in li<sh/>
         
         <line/>terature, science, taste, accomplishments, or 
         <line/>fashion, will exercise a powerful influence on 
         <line/>the general state of manners. We naturally 
         <line/>copy what we admire, and those great and shin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing examples constitute a standard to which 
         <line/>the whole system of life and manners has a 
         <line/>tacit reference. In the United States they have 
         <line/>no such models – they do not aim at so high a 
         <line/>standard, and taste and manners are therefore 
         <line/>necessarily at a lower ebb than in Europe – 
         <line/>Hence all accounts agree in reprobating the ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>treme filthy habits which universally prevail ; and 
         <line/>Cobbett, who will be suspected of too great 
         <line/>partiality to this country, draws a contrast be<sh/>
         
         <line/>tween the inhabitants of Hampshire and those of 
         <line/>the United States, in which he places this vice 
         <line/>of the American manners in strong colours ; and 
         <line/>he adds, as his reason for this, that they have 
         <line/>no gentlemen's seats, with the fine improvements 
         <line/>of pleasure grounds, &amp;c. dispersed through the 
         <line/>country, as models of taste and neatness for the 
         <line/>inferior classes, and it is to the same principles that 
         <line/>we may trace other defects in their manners, 
         <line/>namely, that they have no proper models on which 
         <line/>to form themselves. Hence, excepting in the 
         <line/>principal cities, we may safely conclude, from all 
         <line/>the information we have received on the subject, 
         <line/>that society has not reach the same degree of 
         <line/>refinement as in this country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>An emigrant accustomed to live in Britain 
         <line/>would also feel the disavantages of Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>can society strong in this, that here, in so 
         <line/>closely peopled a community, surrounded with 
         <line/>all sorts of refinements, life is assisted by such 
         <line/>a variety of helps, that it glides down the 
         <line/>smooth stream of comfort and convenience, with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out ever meeting with a single interruption. It 
         <line/>is astonishing to what a pitch of improvement a 
         <line/>society is brough, abounding in wealth and in all 
         <line/>the mechanical arts, and where the ingenuity of 
         <line/>thousands is incessantly on the rack to set on 
         <line/>foot new devices for the common good. We 
         <line/>are not duly sensible of the advantages of this, 
         <line/>because, like other advantages, they are familiar 
         <line/>to us by long habit, and we begin to imagine 
         <line/>that they are inherent in the natural constitution 
         <line/>of things. But when we are suddenly trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>planted into a new community, abounding in<sh/>
         
         <line/>deed in subsistence, but deficient in all com<sh/>
         
         <line/>forts – where only the coarsest mechanic arts are 
         <line/>practised – where the inhabitants are so wide<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly dispersed, that their common exertions 
         <line/>cannot be made available for the common 
         <line/>good, we find life interrupted at every turn. In 
         <line/>our former society, if we had not the previous 
         <line/>secret of transmuting all things into gold, we 
         <line/>had at least the power of transmuting gold into 
         <line/>every thing else. But here the power of money 
         <line/>is limited. We must indeed pay for services, 
         <line/>but we must also beg for them ; and thus we go 
         <line/>on fretting and tormenting ourselves under petty 
         <line/>incommodities, which in this country would be 
         <line/>remedied as soon as they were felt. It is incon<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceivable how much inconvenience and discom<sh/>
         
         <line/>fort and real unhappiness may spring from this 
         <line/>cause. In this country, by long habit and prac<sh/>
         
         <line/>rice and continual improvement, every thing has 
         <line/>fallen into its right place – each individual has a 
         <line/>separate task assigned him in the joint task of 
         <line/>labouring for the general benefit – and the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dustry of all, however variously directed, tends 
         <line/>to one common end. There is a perfect unity 
         <line/>of effort. We all labour in common – we com<sh/>
         
         <line/>bine our efforts that they may yield the largest 
         <line/>possible produce, and this produce is accurately 
         <line/>shared among the various members of the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>munity, each receiving the share to which his 
         <line/>labour entitles him. Such is substantially the 
         <line/>process by which commerce diffuses the benefits 
         <line/>of industry over every civilized community. – 
         <line/>Money is the instrument by which this division 
         <line/>is effected. Every one who labours has the value 
         <line/>of his labour ascertained in money, which is a 
         <line/>draft upon the common stock for whatever quan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tity of necessaries and luxuries he is entitled to ; 
         <line/>and all these complicated operations are execut<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with a regularity almost mechanical. But in 
         <line/>a community newly forming there is a want of 
         <line/>unity and combination – all the members labour 
         <line/>indeed, but no one has his proper part assigned 
         <line/>him – there is a jostling and an interference with 
         <line/>each other – and when they come to divide, 
         <line/>some have too much, and some too little, of cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain articles – the stock is ill assorted, and money 
         <column/>
         <line/>will not execute its functions. Hence disorder 
         <line/>arises, and inconvience and awkward wants, 
         <line/>and an individual suddenly removed into this 
         <line/>region of discomfort from the happier climate of 
         <line/>a highly improved community, must be annoy<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with feeling in the highest degree gloomy 
         <line/>and disagreeable. He must have the same sen<sh/>
         
         <line/>sation as a person who quits an elegant mansion, 
         <line/>fitted up with every comfort and convenience, 
         <line/>for one of inferior quality and coarsely finished, 
         <line/>where he is exposed to a thousand annoyances 
         <line/>every minute. It is observed by Dr Johnson, 
         <line/>that the evil of life does not consist in any sud<sh/>
         
         <line/>den and overwhelming crash of misery, but in a 
         <line/>series of petty discomforts amd mischiefs conti<sh/>
         
         <line/>nually preying upon the temper. The truth of 
         <line/>this maxim, those who emigrate from this coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try to the back woods of America, will have a 
         <line/>good opportunity of verifying. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The prevalence of slavery in most of the States 
         <line/>of the Union constitutes another capital defect 
         <line/>in the structure of American society. These 
         <line/>slaves form a degraded and oppressed class, and, 
         <line/>in the tyranny exercised over them, they them<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves are morally destroyed, while the corruption 
         <line/>extends to the other orders of society, equally 
         <line/>infecting the oppressed and the oppressor, and 
         <line/>debasing the general character and habits of the 
         <line/>people. It is vain to talk of liberty while 
         <line/>stain of tyranny so deeply infects the do<sh/>
         
         <line/>mestic manners of a community. There can 
         <line/>be no rational liberty unless we call that 
         <line/>liberty which gives us the privilge of tortu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ring and oppressing our fellow creatures. To 
         <line/>give an idea of the consequences of this dread<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful evil of slavery, we may state, that it is a 
         <line/>practice in Kentucky to commit delinquent slaves 
         <line/>into the hands of the public executioner, by 
         <line/>whom they are unmercifully flogged at the mar<sh/>
         
         <line/>key cross of the different towns, the streets 
         <line/>being filled with their pietous cries. What 
         <line/>can we think of the people where such spec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tacles are for a moment tolerated. This is so 
         <line/>utterly revolting to every just and enlightened 
         <line/>feeling, that to a European it would form a strong 
         <line/>objection to his permanent residence in that 
         <line/>country. In all the northern states, and in some 
         <line/>of the new states, particularly that of the 
         <line/>Ohio, slavery is indeed abolished. But in se<sh/>
         
         <line/>veral others the black form a large proportion 
         <line/>of the population, and they are not decreasing. 
         <line/>We know indeed that this evil is admitted in 
         <line/>its full extent by all the American statesmen, 
         <line/>that they lament it, but do not well see what 
         <line/>measures can be adopted to check it. The im<sh/>
         
         <line/>portation of new slaves is indeed prohibited, but 
         <line/>the increase of those already in the country 
         <line/>is the great grievance, against which it is 
         <line/>difficult to devise a remedy, and the cruel and 
         <line/>oppressive treatment which slaves will always 
         <line/>meet with wherever they exist, must tend 
         <line/>to degrade the habits and moral feelings of the 
         <line/>community at large. To such, therefore, as are 
         <line/>accustomed to European society, where no such 
         <line/>strain of tyranny infects the domestic manners,

      <p>
         <line/>SIR–It will be remember by many of your Readers, that, in the spring of 1815,
            proclamations were widely circulated, inviting settlers to Canada.–Having myself
            occasion 
         <line/>to visit this country, I was curious to know what had been the result, especially as
            I found at Quebec and Montreal very discordant accounts respecting it ; most people
            asserting 
         <line/>that the scheme had failed of succcess, and that the settlers were in a state of
            great discomfort and discontent.–To ascertain the truth, I diverged from my route about
            50 miles, and 
         <line/>spent some days at Perth, situated on the waters of the Redeau, to which a
            considerable body of the people who accepted the invitation of the Government had been
            conducted.– 
         <line/>Here it traced the reported discontent to some neglect in the general management, and
            some ill conceieved petty regulations, capriciously exercised towards people tenacious
            of their rights ; 
         <line/>but in the main, universal satisfaction prevailed among the settlers, and a strong
            feeling of the good intentions of Government towards them. The opportunity being a good
            one of ascer<sh/>
         
         <line/>taining the progress which a promiscious body of settlers make in a given time. I
            constructed the annexed table, and had each man's signature attached, at once to prove
            to correctness 
         <line/>of his statement, and satisfaction with his situation. Should you think this worthy
            of publication, you are welcome to publish it in your paper. It may draw attention of a
            most important 
         <line/>subject–the colonization of this province with British subjects ; and it may afford
            satisfaction to many individuals who may not otherwise know the condition of their
            friends. The 
         <line/>scheme which Government adopted in 1815 was expensive. The settlers had a free
            passage, rations and tools. Next year rations and tools were furnished to those who came
            out ; 
         <line/>and this year multitudes of poor people have come to Canada, in expectation of being
            favoured in the same way, but are disappointed ; having nothing given them but land (100
            acres 
         <line/>each), which many of them from poverty are unable to occupy. Having made it my study,
            during thrre months residence here, to inquire into the nature of the country, and into
            every 
         <line/>particular respecting settlement, I am convinced that very simple measures might be
            adopted, by which the redundant population of Britain could be conveyed by a regular
            flow into 
         <line/>Canada, instead of being wasted, as it now is, to the great prejudice of British
            interest, over the whole of American ; and were such measures adopted, this province
            would, in a very 
         <line/>few years, be quite equal to its defence in war against the United States –I am, Sir,
            yours, &amp;c.

            <small_caps>Convicts destined for Botany Bay.</small_caps>–It is now seven 
         <line/>weeks since the ten Derby convicts were sent off with several 
         <line/>others, whose destination for the rest of their lives is Botany 
         <line/>Bay. They were, upon landing at Sheerness from the Retri<sh/>
         
         <line/>bution, put on board the Tottenham, which was engaged to 
         <line/>land them at their place of punishment. The number on 
         <line/>board that ship, on leaving Sheerness, was between 2 to 300, 
         <line/>many of whom were diseased and infirm. Their condition has 
         <line/>been rendered most intolerable from an unaccountable delay 
         <line/>that has taken place. The ship Tottenham had not proceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed farther than the Downs when she lost her rudder, by some 
         <line/>accident or other. She returned to Sheerness, where she now 
         <line/>lies, and where she is likely to lie for some time, upon the pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>tence that the loss she has sustained is a justification for delay, 
         <line/>however protracted. The unfortunate inmates have been led 
         <line/>to expect that some important mitigation of their sentence has

            <small_caps>The Hon. Lieut.-Colonel Erskine.</small_caps>–It is with the great<sh/>
         
         <line/>est concern we have to mentioned the death of Lieut.-Colonel 
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Erskine,</small_caps> Lord <small_caps>Erskine's</small_caps> youngest son,
            on his passage to 
         <line/>Ceylon. He served throughout the campaigns in Spain as 
         <line/>a Captain of Light Infantry in the 51st regiment, and be<sh/>
         
         <line/>haved with great gallantry in the battle of the Pyrenees, 
         <line/>where being shot in the thigh he was sent home by the Medi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cal Board, and on his recovery was placed by the Duke of 
         <line/>
            <small_caps>York</small_caps> on the Staff of the Army in the Adjutant-General's 
         <line/>Department when the Duke of <small_caps>Wellington</small_caps> took the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mand in Flanders. He was in the battle of the 16th of June, 
         <line/>and afterwards on the 18th at the battle of Waterloo, where 
         <line/>his station placed him in the dangerous position of being at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tendant on the Duke, around whom almost every officer was 
         <line/>either killed or wounded. Amongst the rest this brave young 
         <line/>man had his left arm carried off by a cannon-ball, which pass<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing along the other laid bare the whole of it, by which he lost 
         <line/>the use of two of his fingers, but that arm was saved. When 
         <line/>the cannon-shot had thrown him from his horse, and as he lay 
         <line/>bleeding upon the groun in this mangled condition, the Prus<sh/>
         
         <line/>sian musketry and trumpets being heard at a distance, he sei<sh/>
         
         <line/>zed his hat with his remaining shattered arm. and waving it 
         <line/>round him cheered his companions in the midst of the dying 
         <line/>and the dead, the Duke of <small_caps>Wellington</small_caps> being then close by 
         <line/>him who desired he might carried to his tent. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It must be some consolation to his afflicted family, that he 
         <line/>must have distinguished himself in the opinion of his great 
         <line/>Commander, as he was immediately recommended by him for 
         <line/>the rank of Major, though a very young officer, and in a year 
         <line/>afterwards to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, with the ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointment of Adjutant-General in Ceylon, and if he had then 
         <line/>fortunately sailed for India his life might probably have been 
         <line/>saved ; but his disposition being as affectionate as it was ani<sh/>
         
         <line/>mated, he could not be persuaded to leave Mrs <small_caps>Erskine</small_caps>, who 
         <line/>was pregnant, and remaining here during the winter, the 
         <line/>cough, with consumptive symptoms, arising from his wound, 
         <line/>laid too deep a hold on him to derive benefit from the voyage, 
         <line/>and he died on his passage to India. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Colonel <small_caps>Erskine</small_caps> was only 25 years of age, and has left three 
         <line/>sons and a daughter, and an infant a few months old.

         <line/>ess Miss <small_caps>Wykeham</small_caps> is said to be finally arranged ; and from 
         <line/>what we observe, it is not likely to suffer any delay from the 
         <line/>late domestic calamity. it is said that the <small_caps>Prince Regent</small_caps>
         
         <line/>has given his own personal assent ; but whether it has passed 
         <line/>through the constitutional forms, and that the <i>Royal Assent in</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>Council</i> has been given we do not pretend to know. It must 
         <line/>have that sanction to secure the Lady the right, for herself 
         <line/>and heirs, of succeeding to the Throne. On this interesting 
         <line/>subject it cannot be forgotten, that <small_caps>King</small_caps> in Council re<sh/>
         
         <line/>fused his assent in three former instances.

            <sh/>
         
         <line/>
            <small_caps>rence</small_caps>, and on Thursday he set off to Brighton, offered his

            <small_caps>rence</small_caps>, lately deceased, was a young man of uncommon ener<sh/>

         <line/>fair of the 10th Light Dragoons, he displayed a spirit of inde<sh/>

         <line/>By the Henry, arrived in the rive from Quebec, we 
         <line/>have advices from thence of the 4th September, three 
         <line/>days later than the last accounts. They confirm, we 
         <line/>regret to say, the intelligence received at Lloyd's on 
         <line/>Friday, of the death of the Duke of Richmond, at 
         <line/>Montreal, where he had arrived on his return from in<sh/>
         
         <line/>specting the new settlements in Upper Canada. His 
         <line/>body had been brought from Montreal to Quebec, 
         <line/>where it was lying in state at the time the Henry sail<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed. His daughter Lady Mary Lennox, continued in 
         <line/>the most afflicting state, and great fears were entertain<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed for her recovery. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Lady Sarah Lennoc, his Grace's second daughter, 
         <line/>is married to Major-General Sir Peregrine Maitland. 
         <line/>They accompanied his grace to North America, and 
         <line/>have remained there since he entered upon his Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. His Grace was the lineal descendant of the 
         <line/>first Duke of Richmond, natural son of King Charles 
         <line/>II. by a French Lady, who was created by his Majesty 
         <line/>Duchess of Portsmouth, and by Louis the Fourteenth, 
         <line/>Duchess of Aubigny, in France. His titles were, 
         <line/>Duke of Richmond, Early of March (English ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>nours) ; Duke of Aubigny, (French Honour) ; Duke 
         <line/>of Lennox, Early of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of 
         <line/>Torbulton (Scots Honours). The title of Aubigny was 
         <line/>confirmed in March 1816, by Louis XVIII by caus<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the estate of Aubigny to be assigned to him, and 
         <line/>granting him the honours of the Louvre, as enjoyed by 
         <line/>his Grace's ancestors. He was a Lieutenant-General 
         <line/>in the army, Colonel of the 35th regiment of foot, Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>nervor of Plymouth, Governor of Upper and Lower 
         <line/>Canada and their dependencies, Lord Lieutenant of 
         <line/>the county of Sussex, and High Steward of Chichester. 
         <line/>–His Grace was born in 1764, succeeded his uncle, 
         <line/>Charles, the late Duke, in 1806, and married in 1783 
         <line/>Charlotte, daughter of Duke of Gordon, by whom 
         <line/>he had issue seven sons and seven daughters, all of them 
         <line/>now living, except his third son, Henry Adam, R. N. 
         <line/>who fell overboard the Blake, as she was sailing into 
         <line/>Port Mahon, in 1812, and was drowned. His Grace 
         <line/>was distinguished early in life by a duel with His 
         <line/>Royal Highness the Duke of York. He was of an 
         <line/>open, candid, generous temper, and of plain and un<sh/>
         
         <line/>affected manners, qualities which were particularly con<sh/>
         
         <line/>spicuous in Ireland, when Viceroy of that country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>His Grace is succeeded in the Peerage his eldest 
         <line/>son Charles, Earl of March, now Duke of Richmond. 
         <line/>This young Nobleman in the army, has seen much active ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vice under the personal auspices of the illustrious Wel<sh/>
         
         <line/>lington, being one of his Grace's Aides-de-camp, and 
         <line/>was one of the Representatives in Parliament for the 
         <line/>City of Chichester, which seat, of course, becomes va<sh/>
         
         <line/>cant. He was lately married to the eldest daughter of 
         <line/>the Marquis of Anglesea, and has issue, a Son, now 
         <line/>Earl of March.

         <line/>The following is extracted from the Quebec papers: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Quebec, Thursday, Sept. 2. 
         <line/>"This Province has again been visited by one of 
         <line/>those afflicting dispensations of Providence, which by 
         <line/>separating by the hand of death, the ruler from the 
         <line/>people, covers whole communities with mourning. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"An express arrived here yesterday morning from 
         <line/>Montreal, with the afflicting intelligence chief that his Grace 
         <line/>the Duke of Richmond, Governor in Chief of these 
         <line/>Provinces, had died on his way from Kingston to Mon<sh/>
         
         <line/>treal, at the moment that he was hourly expected to 
         <line/>join his family there, from which he had separated in 
         <line/>good health at Kingston, one the 20th, to complete by 
         <line/>visiting the new Settlements, the long and arduous 
         <line/>journey in which he has been engaged. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This melancholy and utterly unexpected intelli<sh/>
         
         <line/>gence, spread with the greatest rapidity, and impressed 
         <line/>a deep gloom throughout the city. The flag on the 
         <line/>citadel, and on all the vessels in the port, was hoisted 
         <line/>half-mast, exhibiting every where the signals of public 
         <line/>mourning. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"His Grace's body, immediately after his death, 
         <line/>was conveyed to Montreal. It reached this city last 
         <line/>evening in the steam-boat <i>Malsham</i>, and was remov<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed this forenoon to the Castle, with the usual military 
         <line/>honours, and followed by his Grace's Staff, the prin<sh/>
         
         <line/>cipal Civil and Military Officers in the City and Gar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rison, and a great concourse of mourning inhabitants."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>September 5. 
         <line/>"His Grace's remains were conveyed from Montreal 
         <line/>to Quebec, in a steam-boat. At ten o'clock, one the 
         <line/>morning of the 2d of Sept. they were removed from the 
         <line/>vessel, and placed upon a hearse upon the King's Wharf 
         <line/>at Quebec, from whence it was conveyed to the Cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>teau of St. Louis, where they lay in state until four o'<sh/>
         
         <line/>clock on Saturday the 4th September, when they were 
         <line/>removed to the place of internment in the Cathedral 
         <line/>Church at Quebec.

      <p>
         <line/>"On the corpse being brought out, the collar and 
         <line/>insignia of the Order of the Garter, with his Grace's 
         <line/>military and other appointments being placed on the cof<sh/>
         
         <line/>fin, the whole of the troops presented arms. On its being 
         <line/>placed on the hearse, the troops rested on their arms 
         <line/>reversed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The procession then moved forward. It was com<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed of all the principals persons attached to the pub<sh/>

         <line/>"The military band filed off at the door of the Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>thedral Church-yard and conducted it up the centre 
         <line/>aisle, when it was played on a platform, the mourners 
         <line/>remaining by the body. A signal was then given, when 
         <line/>the body was deposited – 15 guns being fired."/&gt;

         <line/>Extract of a letter, dated Quebec, Sept 5 :–" When 
         <line/>I wrote the first side, I did not expect so soon to com<sh/>
         
         <line/>municate the melancholy event of the death of our Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernor, the Duke of Richmond, who was attacked on his 
         <line/>route from Upper Canada, with symptoms of hydro<sh/>
         
         <line/>phobia, which terminated his mortal career at six miles 
         <line/>from the settlement of Richmond. He was perfectly 
         <line/>sensible of his situation, and gave himself up from the 
         <line/>first spasm which attacked : it was occasioned by 
         <line/>a bite of a tame fox at Sorel, on his way to Upper Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>nada, about three months since. His death, at this 
         <line/>juncture, is looked on as very unfortuante for this coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, as he possessed the entire confidence of Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, and was about completing a plan of defence for 
         <line/>the Canadas, which, when executed, would establish a 
         <line/>water communication with our extreme points, per<sh/>

         <line/>We are happy to learn, further, that no part of his 
         <line/>Grace's family was so dangerously ill, as was at first 
         <line/>reported. They are only in that situation which might 
         <line/>be expected, from so severe an affliction.

         <line/>From the Quebec Gazette of 26th August :ߝThis

         <line/>navy, put a period to his existence by shooting himself 
         <line/>through the head. We are informed that Mr Birch

         <line/>Counties attended the Agricultural Meetings, which 
         <line/>were frequently of four or five hours duration, there 
         <line/>did not occur at any of them a single instance of in<sh/>

            <small_caps>Emigration to America</small_caps>. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In answer to the remarks which appeared in 
         <line/>our paper on Monday last, respecting emigration 
         <line/>to America, and to the statements there given 
         <line/>of the disadvantages which emigrants from 
         <line/>this country might expect to meet with, we have 
         <line/>received a very abusive letter from an anony<sh/>
         
         <line/>mous correspondent, who appears very angry, 
         <line/>and, like most other angry men, seems more 
         <line/>anxious to give full vent to his wrath than to as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sign any good reason for it. His first cause of 
         <line/>quarrel is, that we have stated the general want 
         <line/>of cleanliness to be a prevailing defect in the 
         <line/>back parts of the United States. For this we 
         <line/>have the authority of almost every traveller who 
         <line/>has visited those parts. The remarks of Birkbeck 
         <line/>on this point are conclu-sive and striking: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' In viewing the Americans (he observes) and 
         <line/>' sketching, in a rude manner, as I pass along, 
         <line/>' their striking characteristics, I have seen a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>' formity so general, that I cannot help esteem<sh/>
         
         <line/>' ing it national, though I know it admits of ve<sh/>
         
         <line/>' ry many individual exceptions. I have written 
         <line/>' it, and then erased it, wishing to pass it by, 
         <line/>' but it wont do – it is the truth, and to the truth 
         <line/>' I must adhere. Cleanliness in houses, and too 
         <line/>' often in person, is neglected to a degree which 
         <line/>' is very revolting to an Englishman. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' America was bred in a cabin ; this is not a 
         <line/>' reproach – for the origin is most honourable ; 
         <line/>' but as she has exhanged her hovel of unhewn 
         <line/>' logs for a framed building, and that again for 
         <line/>' a mansion of brick, some of her cabin habits 
         <line/>' have been unconsciously retained. Many have 
         <line/>' already been quitted, and one by one they will 
         <line/>' all be cleared away, as I am told they are now 
         <line/>' in the cities of the eastern states. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' There are, I believe, court-houses, which 
         <line/>' are also made us of as places of worship, in 
         <line/>' which filth of all kinds has been accumulating 
         <line/>' ever since they were built. What reverence 
         <line/>' can be felt for the majesty of religion, or of 
         <line/>' the laws, in such styles of abomination ? The 
         <line/>' people who are content to assemble in them 
         <line/>' can scarcely respect each other. Here is a bad 
         <line/>' public example. It is said that to clean those 
         <line/>' places is the office of no one. But why is no 
         <line/>' person appointed ? Might it not be inferred 
         <line/>' that a disregard to the decencies of life prevails 
         <line/>' through such a community?' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>To the same purpose Cobbett complains of the 
         <line/>' general (for there are many exceptions) sloven<sh/>
         
         <line/>' liness about the homsteads, and particularly 
         <line/>' about the dwellings of labourers. Mr Birkbeck 
         <line/>' complains of this, and indeed what a contrast 
         <line/>' with the homesteads and cottages which he left 
         <line/>' behind him, near the exemplary spot, Guild<sh/>
         
         <line/>' ford, in Surrey.' He then proceeds to give the 
         <line/>reasons for this. When the first settlers took 
         <line/>possession of the country, the ' example of neat<sh/>
         
         <line/>' ness (he observes) was wanting. There were 
         <line/>' no gentlemn's gardens, kept as clean as 
         <line/>' drawing-rooms, with grass as even as a car<sh/>
         
         <line/>' pet. From endeavouring to imitate perfec<sh/>
         
         <line/>' tion men arrive at mediocrity ; and those who 
         <line/>' never have seen or heard of perfection in these 
         <line/>' matters, will naturally be slovens.' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>He afterwards remarks – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' The market day at Guildford is a perfect 
         <line/>' show of cleanliness. Not even a carter without 
         <line/>' even a clean smock-frock, and closely shaven 
         <line/>' and clean washed face. Well may Mr Birkbeck, 
         <line/>' who came from this very spot, think the people 
         <line/>' <i>dirty</i> in the western country. I'll engage he 
         <line/>' finds more dirt upon the necks and faces of one 
         <line/>' family of his present neighbours, than he left 
         <line/>' behind upon the skins of all the people in 
         <line/>' the three parishes of Guildford. However, he 
         <line/>' would not have found this to be the case in 
         <line/>' Pennsylvania, and especially in those parts where 
         <line/>' the Quakers abound ; and, I am told, that in 
         <line/>' the New England States, the people are as 
         <line/>' cleanly and as neat as they are in England. 
         <line/>' The sweetest flowers, when they become pu<sh/>
         
         <line/>' trid, stink the most, and a nasty woman is the 
         <line/>' nastiest thing in nature.' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In answer to all this, our correspondent tells 
         <line/>us, that the Scotch are very dirty. This, we 
         <line/>admit, was formerly, and may still continue in 
         <line/>some degree to be, the reproach of the Scotch. 
         <line/>But does this reasonable person mean to argue 
         <line/>from this, that dirty habits are amiable, and 
         <line/>ought not to be corrected. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>With regard to the difficulties of effecting a 
         <line/>settlement, we are borne out in our remarks on 
         <line/>this subject by the authority of various writers, 
         <line/>and principally by the autheor of the Emigrant's 
         <line/>Guide, a work of great merit, which combines 
         <line/>an extent and precision of statistical informa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion altogether unequally, with the most enlar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ged general views of the state of the country, 
         <line/>both physical and moral. ' Most men (observes 
         <line/>' this judicious writer) on arriving in the United 
         <line/>' States, expects too much. Perhaps the only 
         <line/>' essential advantages offered are the security of 
         <line/>' person and property, and the cheapness of land. 
         <line/>' It demands excessive labour, severe economy, 
         <line/>' and exepmtions from extraordinary accident, to 
         <line/>' succeed in a newly settled country ; and it de<sh/>
         
         <line/>' mands the permanency of this continued la<sh/>
         
         <line/>' bour, prudence, and favourable circumstances.' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our anonymous correspondent is also ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tremely displeased that we have stated so strong<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly the perincious effects produced on the gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>ral manners of the Americans by the existence 
         <line/>of slavery ; and he mentions that many a labour<sh/>
         
         <line/>er in this country might envy the condition of an 
         <line/>American slave. What are those privileges for 
         <line/>which a free man should envy a slave he does 
         <line/>not think proper to state. To show, however, 
         <line/>that we have not exaggerated the degradation 
         <line/>and oppression of the coloured class in the Unit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed States, we shall again adduce the authority of 
         <line/>the Emigrant's Guide. The author is contradict<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the notion that the labourer in the slave 
         <line/>States is confounded with the negroe ; and he 
         <line/>expresses himself in the following terms: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' A residence of 16 years in places where sla<sh/>
         
         <line/>' very is prevalent, enables us to contradict a 
         <line/>' general expression, that, in such places, whites, 
         <line/>' performing manual labour, are confounded in 
         <line/>' the moral estimates of the people with slaves. 
         <line/>' Though less respect is certainly paid to useful 
         <line/>' labour in the slave states than where all the 
         <line/>' duties are performed by whites, yet 
         <line/>' the distance between the two races of men are 
         <line/>' in all cases immense. So deep, profound, and 
         <line/>' inveterate is the feeling on that subject, that 
         <line/>' not any where in the United States can pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>' perty, sobriety, intelligence, and every other 
         <line/>' advantage, expect colour, raise in public opi<sh/>
         
         <line/>' nion a man the most remotely allied to the 
         <line/>' African, to a rank equal to the meanest white. 
         <line/>' Any person who resides a few years in Louisi<sh/>
         
         <line/>' ana will be witness to some very remarkable 
         <line/>' exemplifications of this innate contempt for all 
         <line/>' those who affinity involve them in the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>' tumely heaped upon men degraded by slavery.' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>What a picture is here conveyed of misery 
         <line/>and degradation on the one hand, and of tyranny 
         <line/>on the other. – Here we find it failry confessed 
         <line/>that no degree of worth, whether moral or intel<sh/>
         
         <column/>
         <line/>lectual, not even the possession of property, can 
         <line/>give a man the least degree of consideration in 
         <line/>the eyes of the privileged class. We cannot 
         <line/>conceive a community more wretchedly consti<sh/>
         
         <line/>tuted. All that is estimable and worthy is here 
         <line/>utterly contemned, because the individual who 
         <line/>possesses these qualities happens to have his skin 
         <line/>of a particular colour, and thus a merely acci<sh/>
         
         <line/>dental quality of the corporeal frame entails 
         <line/>upon its unhappy possessor everlasting ignominy 
         <line/>and contempt. These distinctions, carried to 
         <line/>such an excess, seem to us to be founded on the 
         <line/>extinction of every generous and honourable sen<sh/>
         
         <line/>timent, and we cannot help still asserting that 
         <line/>we had rather live we at present are, than 
         <line/>in a community where such hateful antipathies 
         <line/>rule to the exclusion of every just and humane 
         <line/>feeling. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>With regard to the condition of the negroe 
         <line/>slaves we shall quote a passage from Brown's 
         <line/>Western Gazetteer or Emigrant's Directory 
         <line/>after reading which, we shall leave our anony<sh/>
         
         <line/>mous correspondent to say whether he thinks 
         <line/>the condition of a labourer in this country pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferable to that of being an African slave. The 
         <line/>writer, describing the town of Lexington, in 
         <line/>Kentucky, observes – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>' In this square stands the market-house, 
         <line/>' which is of brick, and well furnished on Wed<sh/>
         
         <line/>' nesdays and Saturdays ; but occasionally the 
         <line/>' scene of a barbarous practise ; for it is here 
         <line/>' that incorrigible or delinquent negroes are 
         <line/>' flogged unmercifully. I saw this punishment 
         <line/>' inflicted on two of these wretches. Their 
         <line/>' screams soon collected a numerous crowd ; I 
         <line/>' could not help saying to myself, " These cries 
         <line/>' are the knell of Kentucky libery.' "/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Having made this answer to the angry charges 
         <line/>thus brought against us, we have only to dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>claim, in the strongest terms, all hostility or pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>judice against the Americans. We have no 
         <line/>wish either to depreciate their character or in<sh/>
         
         <line/>stitutions. They exhibit the interesting spectacle 
         <line/>of a nation advancing with an irresistible pace 
         <line/>to wealth and greatness. To revile such a 
         <line/>people would be the height of human folly, and 
         <line/>equally foolish is it for their blind admirers to 
         <line/>take offence because endeavour to make a 
         <line/>fair estimate of their character, without hiding 
         <line/>any of its defects.

         <line/>as necessaries to the murder of Robert Semple, Esq. 
         <line/>and others at Red River, on the 19th of June, 1816 
         <line/>and the trial was rendered extremely interesting by the 
         <line/>disclousure which took place of many extraordinary cir<sh/>
         
         <line/>cumstances connected with the Hudson's Bya and 
         <line/>North West Companies, which for some time past has 
         <line/>excited so much of the public attention in this Pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vince. The gentlemen tried on this occasion were, 
         <line/>Messrs. Alexander Mackenzie, 
         <line/>Hugh M'Gillis, 
         <line/>Simon Fraser, 
         <line/>John Macdonald, and 
         <line/>John M'Laughlin 
         <line/>} accused as accessories 
         <line/>after the fact. 
         <line/>and Mr John Severlight, accused as an accessory <i>before</i>
         
         <line/>and <i>after</i> the fact. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It appeared in evidence that the North West Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany had been upwards of thirty years in possession 
         <line/>of trading posts called <i>forts</i> at different points on the 
         <line/>Red River in the Indian Territories, and it is well 
         <line/>known that for a century before the North West Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany, the Canadian for traders had been in the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stant practise of resorting to that country which was 
         <line/>visited for the first time by traders of the Hudson's 
         <line/>Bay Company about twenty-five years ago. It was 
         <line/>put in evidence that for many years afterwards both 
         <line/>companies carried on their trade to Red River without 
         <line/>interference in each others pursuits, and without any 
         <line/>disturbance in the country ; and it was explained that 
         <line/>the principal object of the trade being to collect pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions, (enlisting chiefly of the dried flesh of the buf<sh/>
         
         <line/>falo, which abound in the plains) and the country pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducing abundance for the supply of both parties, the 
         <line/>same causes of dissention did not exist as at trading 
         <line/>stations where the fine furs are obtained in small quan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tities, and where rival traders would at all times be 
         <line/>likely to dispute about the divisions of them. The Red 
         <line/>River country therefore remained quiet and undisturb<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed until the arrival of the Earl of Selkirk's Colonists 
         <line/>and Servants, and the attempts made by their leaders 
         <line/>to prevent the usual supplies of provisions from being 
         <line/>obtained by the traders. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The proclamation of Miles Macdonnell the soi-dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>ant <i>Governor of Ossinibour</i>, prohibiting the exporta<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of provisions from Red River, was the first docu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment produced for the defence at the recent trials. It 
         <line/>was proved that, under this assumed authority, several 
         <line/>acts of violence were committed by Mr Macdonnell and 
         <line/>his followers. Trading posts and buildings were for<sh/>
         
         <line/>cibly entered, depots of provisions seized, the river (the 
         <line/>only outlet from the country) blockaded by batteries 
         <line/>mounted with cannon, and the trade of the North 
         <line/>West Company wholly interdicted, before any acts of 
         <line/>retaliation were attempted on their part, and even be<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore they took any precautions for their own defence 
         <line/>or for ensuring the safety of their provisions, on which 
         <line/>depended the existence of their trade, and the lives of 
         <line/>their people. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mutual and continual acts of aggression and ret<sh/>
         
         <line/>aliation appeared to have exasperated the minds of both 
         <line/>parties, and to have rendered them so suspicious of the 
         <line/>designs of each other as to be always on their guard 
         <line/>and prepared for defence. In short it appeared in 
         <line/>evidence that the country remained in a state of pri<sh/>
         
         <line/>vate war, which at length ended in the <i>battle</i> of the 
         <line/>loch of Jane, 1816. The particulars of this unfort<sh/>
         
         <line/>unate affray were fully investigated in the trial of Bouche 
         <line/>and Brown for murder, as <i>principals</i>. The state<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments on both sides are already before the public, and 
         <line/>the acquittal of the prisoners shows sufficiently that the 
         <line/>jury considered Mr Semple and his party to have been 
         <line/>the assailants. On the trial of the alleged accessories 
         <line/>the cirumstances which led to the meeting of the hos<sh/>
         
         <line/>tile parties were made out in the evidence to the following 
         <line/>effect, viz : – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In <i>March</i>, 1816, Mr Colin Robertson, with an 
         <line/>armed party, acting under the orders of <i>Governor</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>Semple</i>, who had succeeded <i>Governor</i> Miles Macdonnell 
         <line/>at Red River, captured by surprise the North West 
         <line/>trading post at the forks of the river, called <i>Fort</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>Gibraltar</i>, and took possession of all the stores and 
         <line/>provisions. In the latter part of the following month 
         <line/>of May, Governor Semple caused the buildings (which 
         <line/>were of wood) to be taken to pieces, and the materials 
         <line/>were floated fown the river in rafts, to be used in con<sh/>
         
         <line/>structing his new fort, which he called <i>Fort Douglas</i>
         
         <line/>and where, (following the examples of his predecessors) 
         <line/>he mounted cannon to command the passage of the 
         <line/>river, built an armed schooner, or gun-boat, to com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plete the blockage, and effectually to intercept the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions and trade of the North West Company. Mr. 
         <line/>Alexander Macdonnell, a partner of the North West 
         <line/>Company, who had charge of their provisions at Ri<sh/>
         
         <line/>viere Qui Appele, one of the branches of the Red River, 
         <line/>became alarmed at these measures of hostility, and as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembled as many people as he could (half breeds and 
         <line/>others) for the protection of the property under his care, 
         <line/>with which, at the usual time, he proceeded down the 
         <line/>river till he arrived within sixty miles of Governor 
         <line/>Semple's fort. He then landed his provisions, made 
         <line/>dispositions to defend them, if attacked, and sent a 
         <line/>party of his people, with a temporary supply to meet 
         <line/>the canoes from below, apprise them of the blockages, 
         <line/>and concert with them the means of eluding or re<sh/>
         
         <line/>moving it. This party, under the direction of Cuth<sh/>
         
         <line/>bert Grant (a half breed, and a clerk of the N. West 
         <line/>Company) was ordered to land above Fort Douglas 
         <line/>in order to keep out of the reach of the cannon, and 
         <line/>to carry these provisions in carts, at as great a distance 
         <line/>as possible from the fort, so as to avoid being seen.– 
         <line/>This it was fully proved they did ; but a swamp in the 
         <line/>rear of the fort compelled them to pass within about 
         <line/>two miles of it, and being deserted and pursued from 
         <line/>then, the conflict ensued in which Mr Semple, and 
         <line/>most of his party, were killed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It was further made out in evidence that in the 
         <line/>Spring of the year 1816, the agent of the North West 
         <line/>Company at Montreal were still in need of more than 
         <line/>the usual supply of provisions from the Red River, be<sh/>
         
         <line/>cause there had not yet been time to replace the ves<sh/>
         
         <line/>sels on the lakes, and the other means of transport 
         <line/>which the Americans had destroyed during the war, 
         <line/>nor to replenish their stores at Fort William, with the 
         <line/>usual quantity of provisions from Canada. Having 
         <line/>also heard of the seizure of one of their posts at Red 
         <line/>River in the fall of the year 1815, and apprehending 
         <line/>further aggressions in the spring, Mr M'Leod, one of 
         <line/>the agents, with all the partners and clerks who could 
         <line/>be spared from Montreal, proceeded up the country 
         <line/>early in the Spring, and on arriving at Fort William, 
         <line/>received intelligence of the capture of Fort Gibraltar 
         <line/>and the blockade of Red River, towards which place 
         <line/>he immediately proceeded with as many of the part<sh/>
         
         <line/>ners, clerks, and servants of the Company as he could 
         <line/>collect by the way, in order to rescue the intercepted 
         <line/>provisions, in the defence of which, or in their own 
         <line/>defence, if fired on by Semple's blockading battery, it 
         <line/>was their avowed purpose to use force if necessary, but 
         <line/>it was distinctly proved that their intentions and orders 
         <line/>issued to their cannonmen, were, to pass Fort Douglas 
         <line/>singing, and to proceed up the river for their provi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sions, without landing or molesting any one unless 
         <line/>they should be attacked.–They arrived at Red River 
         <line/>three days after the battle, and Mr M'Leod, who was 
         <line/>a Magistrate, being of opinion that Mr Semple's party 
         <line/>had been the assailants, and that the half breeds had 
         <line/>only acted in self defence, did not adopt any measures 
         <line/>against them, (the half breeds) but, on the contrary, 
         <line/>expressed approbation for their having defended their 
         <line/>provisions, and gave them the supplies of clothing, &amp;c. 
         <line/>usually given to all the servants of the North West 
         <line/>Company, while, at the same time, he arrest some 
         <line/>of the survivors of Mr Semple's party, and served sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>poenas upon others to give evidence of these transactions 
         <line/>in the Courts of Lower Canada. 
         <column/>
         <line/>This was the whole of the evidence, and the only 
         <line/>circumstances which appeared relative to the prisoners, 
         <line/>were that Mr Sevewright (the alleged accessory before 
         <line/>the fact) was with Mr Alexander Macdonnell when he 
         <line/>sent off Grant and his party to escort the provisions 
         <line/>past Fort Douglas, and that the alleged accessaries 
         <line/>after the fact arrived at Red River with Mr M'Leod, 
         <line/>after the battle was over, and appeared to consider it, 
         <line/>as it is now found to have been, an affray in which the 
         <line/>unsuccessful party were to blame, and in which the 
         <line/>successful party <i>were not murderers</i>–The Judge who 
         <line/>presided at the trial, declared in his charge to the jury 
         <line/>that there was not a <i>scintilla</i> of evidence " against any 
         <line/>one of these gentlemen," and the jury accordinagly re<sh/>
         
         <line/>turned a verdict of <i>Not Guilty</i>. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It will be recollected that these gentlemen were ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rested by the Earl of Selkirk, at Fort William, in Aug 
         <line/>1815, on the charges of High Treason and Conspi<sh/>
         
         <line/>racy, as well as Murder–and that the buildings and 
         <line/>property of the North West Company at that place 
         <line/>were forcibly seized and subsequently retained by an 
         <line/>armed force under his Lordship's command. The 
         <line/>North West Company represented at the time that these 
         <line/>accusations were merely a pretext set up to palliate the 
         <line/>preconcerted plunder of their property, and destruction 
         <line/>of their trade, while, on the part of Lord Selkirk, it 
         <line/>was alleged that the crimes committed by the partners 
         <line/>of the North West Company were so atrocious, as to 
         <line/>justify his Lordship's proceedings against them ; and 
         <line/>for some time the public opinion remained in suspense 
         <line/>as to the real merits of the case. So far as regarded 
         <line/>the seizure of property and the interruption of trade, 
         <line/>the point was decided by the Prince Regent's Procla<sh/>
         
         <line/>mation of the 3rd of May, 1817, in consequence of 
         <line/>which the North West Company recovered possession 
         <line/>of their property, and re-established their trade ; but 
         <line/>that proclamation left the rights of parties, and the 
         <line/>crimes alleged against the individuals, to be investigated 
         <line/>and decided upon by the law – and until such investi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gation could take place, much uncertainty necessarily 
         <line/>prevailed from the contradictory statements and affida<sh/>
         
         <line/>vits which had been laid before the public. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The recent trials at York however decided the 
         <line/>point as to the alleged <i>murders</i>, and the charge of 
         <line/>
            <i>High Treason</i> has never been followed up, nor ever 
         <line/>mentioned, since it served the desired purpose, by 
         <line/>figuring in Lord Selkirk's Warrant as a pretext for 
         <line/>seizing and examining the books and private papers of 
         <line/>of the North West Company.

            <small_caps>Reform in Upper Canada</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It has been already mentioned that Governor 
         <line/>Maitland, on opening the session of the Legis<sh/>
         
         <line/>lature of Upper Canada, recommended that mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sures should be taken to prevent the meeting 
         <line/>of delegates for obtaining reform in Upper Cana<sh/>
         
         <line/>da. Accounts from Quebec and Montreal, da<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted the end of November, state, that in pursu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ance of this recommendation, the Legislature, 
         <line/>on one of the first days of its meeting, appoint<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed a Committee to inquire into the subject, who 
         <line/>almost instantly came to the following resolu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion :ߝ 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved, That it is the opinion of this Committee that 
         <line/>some such legislative provision should be enacted as the wis<sh/>
         
         <line/>dom of the Imperial Parliament has found it proper to pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vide to meet similar occasions, to put it out of the power of 
         <line/>any designing persons to organize discontent. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The proceeding appears to have raised the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dignation of the Gourlay or reofrming party in 
         <line/>Upper Canada, as will be seen by the following 
         <line/>extract :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Montreal, November 21. 
         <line/>This legislative provision, it will be immediate<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly perceived, is the suspension of the Habeas 
         <line/>Corpus act, for that was the course pursued in 
         <line/>England. We do not believe that there is the 
         <line/>most remote necessity for such a measure. We 
         <line/>do not hesitate to say, that the members have 
         <line/>not spoken the sentiments of heir constituents, 
         <line/>in their echo of Sir P. Maitland's speech, with 
         <line/>the most humiliating servility ; and we feel con<sh/>
         
         <line/>vinced that it will not be borne with by the 
         <line/>people, while they have the control in any way 
         <line/>of their representatives. The sentiment therein 
         <line/>attempted to be disseminated is an 
      </p>
      <p>
         <pg/>
         <column/>
         <line/>libel on the truly loyal people of Upper Canada. 
         <line/>It would sound in our ears like the knell of their 
         <line/>liberty, if we were not persuaded, that its adop<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion would provoke a spirit of resistance, not 
         <line/>corporal, but mental ; not secret and illegal, but 
         <line/>open and legitimate, which (if the Administra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion do not take the decision of the question 
         <line/>from the people by force, and we believe they 
         <line/>cannot nor dare not) will serve to purge the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stitution of the united province from the injury 
         <line/>which it has received by mal-administration.

         <line/>A very numerous and respectable meeting of the in<sh/>

         <line/>trade of the North West Company, and impoverish the 
         <line/>partnes thereof, was found by the Grand Jury, against 
         <line/>Thomas Douglas, Early of Selkirk ; J. B. Chevalier de 
         <line/>Lorimer, Captain in his Majesty's Indian Department ; 
         <line/>Captain Pratais D'Orsonnens, late of the De Meuron

         <line/>tain Miles Macdonnel, late of the Canadian Fecibles ; 
         <line/>Lieutenant Alexander Bridport Beecher, late of the

         <line/>chibald Macdonald, and John P. Bourke. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The indictment contains three counts ; and amongst 
         <line/>the numerous overt acts therein set forth, support<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by documentary and oral evidence, the following 
         <line/>were particularly prominent :– The engaging and ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>mind a number of disbanded soldiers (foreigners) ; the 
         <line/>entry of them, by force of arms, into Fort William, 
         <line/>in August, 1816 ; retaining possession of the fort till 
         <line/>May 1817 ; sending off as prisoners the partners of 
         <line/>the North West Company found there ; getting rid of 
         <line/>the clerks, by subpoenas to appear at York at a period 
         <line/>when no courts are held there, without ever inquiring 
         <line/>whether they know anything of the matters to which 
         <line/>the subpoenas related, and without ever bringing them 
         <line/>forward afterwards ; stopping of the outfits from going 
         <line/>into the interior, and the returns from coming into 
         <line/>Montreal ; possessing themselves of all the books and 
         <line/>papers of the concern ; sending away the principal 
         <line/>clerk under a charge of felony, without examination, 
         <line/>and without having ever followed up the charge ; the 
         <line/>pretended sale, by Daniel Mackenzie, of the North 
         <line/>West property, obtained by his Lordship by means of 
         <line/>continued duress ; tampering with, and debauching the 
         <line/>North West Company's servants, and commanding 
         <line/>them in the King's name ; writing circular letters to 
         <line/>the partners and clerks in the interior country, advis<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing them to abandon their trust, alleging that the 
         <line/>North West Company were ruined, and to carry the 
         <line/>furs to Hudson's Bay ; taking possession of Fort Lake 
         <line/>La Pluie, and the property there, and stopping the na<sh/>
         
         <line/>vigation, &amp;c, &amp;c.

      <p>
         <line/>Upon this being returned a true bill the Attorney<sh/>
         
         <line/> General moved the process of the Court against the

            <small_caps>Wm Smith v. The Earl of Selkirk</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This was a civil action brough by Mr Wm Smith 
         <line/>against Lord Selkirk for false imprisonment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff was under<sh/>
         
         <line/> sheriff of the Western District, and as such, the bear<sh/>
         
         <line/>er of a writ of restitution founded upon a verdict of a 
         <line/>special jury at Sandwich, in October 1816, and grant<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by the Magistrate, ordering the restoration of Fort 
         <line/>William to the North West Company. He was also 
         <line/>the bearer of a warrant, for felony, issued against his 
         <line/>Lordship, Dr Allen, Captain Matthey, and others, u<sh/>
         
         <line/>pon an information upon oath before a justice of the 
         <line/>Peace. Mr Smith got to Fort William on the 19th of 
         <line/>March 1817, and produced his writ of restitution, 
         <line/>with which his Lordship refused to comply ; and when 
         <line/>the Earl and others were arrested by Mr Smith, upon 
         <line/>the warrant for felony, his Lordship laid hold of him 
         <line/>and pushed him out of doors ; and he was afterwards 
         <line/>kept in close custody in the fort under a military guard. 
         <line/>A circumstance which added much to the grievous na<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture of the offence, and which was particularly dwelt 
         <line/>upon by the Judge, in his charge to the Jury, was, that 
         <line/>whilst Mr Smith was kept in a rigorous confinement, 
         <line/>Charles de Reinhard, though under an accusation of 
         <line/>was at large and keeping a school, though no<sh/>
         
         <line/>minally under the surveillance of one or two of his for<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer comrades. The Chief Justice also remarked upon a<sh/>
         
         <line/>nother part of the evidence for the defence, by which 
         <line/>it appeared that the only option left to Mr Smith to ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain his liberty was that of abandoning his duty, and 
         <line/>breaking his oath of office, by a promise not to molest 
         <line/>Lord Selkirk. Mr Smith, however, notwithstanding 
         <line/>this proposal, persisted in doing his duty, and was not 
         <line/>liberated until the evacuation of Fort William by his 
         <line/>Lordship and his forces in May, 1818. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Jury after some deliberation, returned a verdict 
         <line/>in favour of the plaintiff.– Damages L.500 Halifax 
         <line/>currency.

         <line/>mond, in America, in honour of the 22d of February, 
         <line/>a journal says, " A melancholy catastrophe closed the 
         <line/>day. Colonel W. Tatham, so well known in England 
         <line/>and this country, for his acquaintance with civil engi<sh/>

         <line/>by an unfortunate habit to which he had become ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>dicted–was destined on that day to breathe his last.– 
         <line/>In a moment of intemperance, as he stood by the piece 
         <line/>of artillery which was firing the evening salute, he ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>claimed that he wished to die. As the second gun was 
         <line/>about to fire, and immediately after the commanding 
         <line/>had given the word " Fire!" Conolonel Tatham 
         <line/>presented himself in front of the muzzle of the piece, 
         <line/>and by its discharge his abdomen was almost literally 
         <line/>blown to pieces. His body was raised a few feet in the 
         <line/>air by the explosion, and he fell upon his face without 
         <line/>uttering one word that was heard by the byestanders.– 
         <line/>Colonel Tatham died without any family. Circum<sh/>
         
         <line/>stances had strip life of much of its attractions in his 
         <line/>eyes ; but it is impossible not to regard the manner of 
         <line/>his death with horroer, and to feel the deepest commi<sh/>
         
         <line/>seraton for his melancholy fate. He was a man of 
         <line/>great information, of great genius, and of great re<sh/>

            <small_caps>Leeds,</small_caps>
            <i>April</i> 19.–We have been somewhat alarmed here 
         <line/>to-day, though no bad consequences have followed, by a most 
         <line/>numerous assemblage of croppers, cloth-dressers, and other 
         <line/>artisans and labourers out of employment. They kep com<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing in at an early hour in the forenoon from Wortley, Arm<sh/>
         
         <line/>ley, Holbeck, and all the neighbouring towns and villages 
         <line/>and it is computed that at one time there were full three 
         <line/>thousand of these distressed people assembled, chiefly in Brig<sh/>
         
         <line/>gate. As many of them marched into the town with great 
         <line/>sticks in their hands, they created some little alarm, but their 
         <line/>conduct was uniformly peaceable; their complaints were not 
         <line/>loud, though they might be deep ! The worthy Mayor and 
         <line/>Magistrates, with the whole of the Civil Power, were in rea<sh/>
         
         <line/>diness to act as circumstances might require; but, fortunately, 
         <line/>there was not the slightest occasion for their interference. 
         <line/>By far the greater number of the assemblage dispersed by noon, 
         <line/>and returned to their respective homes. Several respectable 
         <line/>gentlemen went among them, to ascertain the motives of 
         <line/>their thus assembling ; and from every inquiry it does not ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pear that they have the least disposition to commit any breath 
         <line/>of the peace ; but in fact, the people know not what to do 
         <line/>in their present state of distress. I understand that an active 
         <line/>subscription is going, to enable a number of these poor 
         <line/>men to proceed to Canada; and others are said to have ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pressed their wish to be sent to Botany Bay, provided they 
         <line/>can obtain the sanction of Government. The case of these 
         <line/>people is a very perplexing one ; for their numbers augment 
         <line/>daily by fresh discharges from the various manufactories.

         <line/>amount of wages diminishes as works get scarcer. Emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to America still continues; but it is, for the most part, of 
         <line/>a description of person who have afforded employ to others 
         <line/>rather than require it for themselves. Many also take some 
         <line/>property with them. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Amongst the recent emigrations to the United States, there 
         <line/>are twenty six persons belonging to one family, (Quakers, of 
         <line/>the name of Thistlewaith,) lately residing in Meadow lane, 
         <line/>Leeds. These industrious and enterprising individuals are 
         <line/>gone with an intention of carrying on the woollen manufac<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture (in conjunction with others) on an extensive scale, ei<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther at Philadelphia or some other more eligible site in its 
         <line/>vicinity. Several other families are preparing to emigrate 
         <line/>from the same neighbourhood, as well as from Dewsbury, 
         <line/>Bradford, and other places in the vicinity. It is true these 
         <line/>extensive emigrations may, in some degree, contribute to re<sh/>
         
         <line/>lieve our overburdened population ; but they must likewise 
         <line/>tend, in an equal ratio, to impoverish the nation ; as every 
         <line/>individual and family who emigrate, setting aside the pecu<sh/>
         
         <line/>niary wealth they carry with them, take what is of far more 
         <line/>consequence to a commercial nation–their talents and in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dustry–articles, at present, of comparative small value in the 
         <line/>country.

         <line/>The very heavy impost which is at present levied upon au<sh/>
         
         <line/>thors and publishers, by being compelled, under the existing 
         <line/>Copyright Act to deliver eleven copies of every book publish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to certain public libraries, is likely to be repealed by a Bill 
         <line/>to be brought into Parliament in a few days. The body of 
         <line/>evidence taken before the Select Committe of the House of 
         <line/>Commons last year, forms a most interesting display of the 
         <line/>state of literary property in this country.

            <i>Extraordinary Legacy.</i>–A very singular cause is now de<sh/>
         
         <line/>pending before the Court of Session in Scotland, respecting a 
         <line/>legacy to the amount of upwards of <i>fifty thousand pounds,</i>be<sh/>
         
         <line/>queathed by the late Earl of F. (who died at Berlin) to a fo<sh/>
         
         <line/>reigner, who was one of his domestic servants. The payment 
         <line/>of the legacy is disputed by the heir-at-law of the late Earl, 
         <line/>on the ground that it was given for a highly immoral consi<sh/>
         
         <line/>deration ; and from its novelty the case is, of course, the sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject of much conversation in the Northern Metropolis. The 
         <line/>arguments and pleadings in this extraordinary suit, in which 
         <line/>the most eminent counsel of the Edinburgh Bar are engaged, 
         <line/>display much classical as well as legal learning ; but no judg<sh/>
         
         <line/>ement has yet been pronounced by the Court. From the mag<sh/>
         
         <line/>nitude of the sum in dispute, it will probably be finally de<sh/>
         
         <line/>termined by an appeal to the House of Lords.–<i>Morn. Chron.</i>

            <i>Town Hall, Southwark.</i>–Thomas Wing was brought up by 
         <line/>Reeve, the Marshalman, and examined before Sir John Earner[?], 
         <line/>the sitting Magistrate, charged on suspicion of robbing his em<sh/>
         
         <line/>ployers, Messrs Sentance and Flint, grocers, NO. 300. Borough, 
         <line/>High-street. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The prisoner's detection was caused in the following singu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar manner :–He was porter to the prosecutors, and was fre<sh/>
         
         <line/>quently about the shop ; a large house dog having seen him 
         <line/>take money from the till, which he tied in his pocket hand<sh/>
         
         <line/>kerchief, followed him about till he saw him conceal it in a 
         <line/>shed near the stables, and then he came into the shop and ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>peared quite restless, pulling every person by the skirt[?] and 
         <line/>apparently wishing them to follow him. At length Henry 
         <line/>Heydon, the apprentice, having occasion to go to the stable, 
         <line/>the dog followed him, and having drawn his attention to the 
         <line/>heap of rubbish, under which the money was buried, began to 
         <line/>scratch at it till he brought the booty to view ! The appren<sh/>
         
         <line/>tice brought it to his master, who counted, and found it to 
         <line/>contain 12s. in copper coin. After marking it he desired the 
         <line/>boy to place it in the same spot, which he did, and soon af<sh/>
         
         <line/>terwards, finding that it was removed, he asked the prisoner 
         <line/>some questions about it, but he declared his ignorance of the 
         <line/>whole transaction. Reeve, the Marshalman, was then sent 
         <line/>for, who, on searching the prisoner, found some of the marked 
         <line/>ballpence[?] in his pocket.–Remanded.

            <i>Bank Committee.</i>–The Opposition Journals, last wek, as<sh/>
         
         <line/>serted that the Rank Restriction Committee of the House of 
         <line/>Commons intend to report in favour of Mr Ricardo's plan of 
         <line/>paying in specie. That is, the Bank shall pay next January 
         <line/>in gold bars at the present price of gold, L.4 1s. per ounce, 
         <line/>any quanitity of notes not being less than sixty or a hundred 
         <line/>pounds' worth, and that in two years afterwards they shall 
         <line/>pay them in gold bars at the standard price of gold, L.3, 17s. 
         <line/>10 1/2 per ounce. Mr Ricardo's plan goes farther. It re<sh/>
         
         <line/>commends that the Bank shall never pay in coin, but in bars 
         <line/>of gold, at the standard price ; in short that the Bank shall 
         <line/>at all times buy gold, when offered, at L.3, 17s. and sell it, 
         <line/>when demanded, at L.3, 17s. 10 1/2d. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>If the Opposition Journals be correct in stating that the 
         <line/>Restriction Committee intend to report in favour of payments 
         <line/>in bullion at the market price ; and should Parliament adopt 
         <line/>that plan ; then there will be a very great saving to the na<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion in the expense of coinage, the waste of, &amp;c. All 
         <line/>the purposes for which a metallic currency is necessary in fo<sh/>
         
         <line/>reign commerce, will be answered as well by payments in gold 
         <line/>bars as by payments in coins, and the danger of a domestic run 
         <line/>on the Bank for gold coin in a moment of panic, as in 1797, 
         <line/>will be completely prevented. This is, indeed, at all times, 
         <line/>the only danger to which it is exposed. A run for coin on 
         <line/>the Country Banks would instantly fall on the Bank of England, 
         <line/>and would cramp, if not dry up,the currency throughout the 
         <line/>empire, producing the greatest confusion. Now, if the Op<sh/>
         
         <line/>position Journals be correct, the currency will be placed in 
         <line/>perfect security, at perfect ease. Nothing will be able to dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>order it. If persons will hoard specie, they must purchase 
         <line/>gold bars or foreign coin, or content themselves with silver. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the year 1815 and 1816 we imported corn only to the 
         <line/>amount of L.800,000 each year, and then the value of gold 
         <line/>was rather below the standard price. In the year 1817 we 
         <line/>imported to the amount of six millions, and in the year 1818 
         <line/>we imported to the amount of eleven million Sterling. Du<sh/>
         
         <line/>ring the last two years the price of gold rose. Should we have 
         <line/>an abundant harvest or two, and little importation of corn 
         <line/>become necessary, gold will again fall very low. The Bank 
         <line/>will then be able to pay, to buy gold to the full extent of Mr 
         <line/>Ricardo's plan, and to place their notes on a firm, unques<sh/>
         
         <line/>tionable foundation. The finances of the continent, and of 
         <line/>the world, indeed–the sources and circulation of money will, 
         <line/>during peace, gradually become steadier and better known. 
         <line/>The East Indies at present drain away an extraordinary quan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tity of specie, while Spanish America, in consequence of her 
         <line/>troubles, yields far less than usual. It would be madness to 
         <line/>fly in the face of all these circumstances, by compelling the 
         <line/>Bank to pay in gold coin. Perhaps it may be desirable to li<sh/>
         
         <line/>mit the issue of bank notes to some certain, yet liberal amount. 
         <line/>We pretend not to anticipate the Report of the Committee ; 
         <line/>but, if some rumours be true, we augur favourably of it. It[?] 
         <line/>is said Mr Tierney divided the Committee, and stood alone in 
         <line/>voting against the Report. Thus, then, the Report cannot be 
         <line/>in favour of a very sudden or decided plan for the resumpion 
         <line/>of cash payments, or Mr Tierney would not have voted against 
         <line/>it ; and yet it must hold out a reasonable prospect of a rational 
         <line/>scheme for that resumption, or the other five or six Opposi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion Members of the Committee would not have voted for it.

            <i>Grand Pigeon Match</i>, three Gentlemen of the Midgham 
         <line/>Club, against thrice of All England, took place on Monday on 
         <line/>Farnham Downs, at twenty-one birds, twenty-one yards dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance from the gun, for 150 guineas aside, charge unlimited. 
         <line/>Messrs Adams, Russel and Holt, were selected from the Crack 
         <line/>Club against Messrs King, Short and Keans. The sports were 
         <line/>as follows ; Mr Adams killed nineteen birds, and the remain<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing two were severely hit. Russel killed eighteen, but lost 
         <line/>one three yards out of bounds, and Mr Holt bagged sixteen, 
         <line/>making a grand total of fifty-two from sixty-three. The Club 
         <line/>was at first backed to win, but the England shots were now 
         <line/>backed freely at six to four, as they were considered safe 
         <line/>
            <i>eighteen</i> bird men. Mr King killed twenty, but lost two out 
         <line/>of bounds. Short missed his first three, which brought bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ting to two to one onn the Club, but he killed the next seven<sh/>
         
         <line/>teen, and missed the last bird. Mr Keans had seventeen to 
         <line/>tie, and eighteen to win, and he was back at five to four 
         <line/>and at two to one, after killing eleven birds in succession. 
         <line/>He, however, missed the seventeenth, and had to kill the o<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther four to win. He succeeded, and the prize was won by once

         <line/>Letters from Petersburgh, of the 15th ultimo, mention that

         <line/>to England, for the purpose of completing his studies at Ox<sh/>

         <line/>unfortunate young Prince, who excites universal interest and 
         <line/>sympathy in the north of Europe. In these feelings we must 
         <line/>largely share, for we cannot easily forget the associations with 
         <line/>which the name of <i>Vasa</i> was connected, not the services ren<sh/>
         
         <line/>dered by two Sovereigns of that Illustrious House to the cause 
         <line/>of civil and religious liberty. It is said that a great Potentate,

         <line/>upon Prince Gustavus an allowance of L. 2,000 Sterling per 
         <line/>annum, during the residence of the latter in England, and that 
         <line/>on the return of his Royal Highness to the Continent he is 
         <line/>to espouse his cousin, a Princess of Hesse Cassel, who, if ru<sh/>

         <line/>the Mississippi on the 10th of this month, after a <mention keyword="emigration"
               >voyage</mention>
         
         <line/>of 82 days from Gravesend. Your son and myself are in 
         <line/>excellent health, and very happy. There are 35 English 
         <line/>vessels from Liverpool now here, and a great many Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>lish emigrants from Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lanca<sh/>
         
         <line/>shire, Wiltshire, Hampshire, and Somersetshire ; and, 
         <line/>in fact, from almost all parts of the heavily-taxed <mention province="England"
               country="United Kingdom">island</mention>
         
         <line/>we have left behind us ! Our ship was detained near a 
         <line/>week in the river, about 80 miles below <mention city="New Orleans"
               province="Louisiana" country="United States">New Orleans</mention> ; 
         <line/>we all went on shore, and had plenty of rabbit shooting. 
         <line/>I killed the most with my double-barrelled gun, by Knock, 
         <line/>corner of Fetter-lane. Henry, myself, and Mr Blake 
         <line/>went one day into the woods to kill deer, by night co<sh/>
         
         <line/>ming on, we lost our road ; and, differing in opinions, we 
         <line/>separated, Henry and Mr Blake taking one road, and my<sh/>
         
         <line/>self the other. I reached the ship (about five miles) at ten 
         <line/>o'clock ; but they remained lost all night in the woods, 
         <line/>and did not return to us till the next morning. It being 
         <line/>wet, and Henry sleeping on the marshy ground, in spite 
         <line/>of the remonstrances of Mr Blake, caught a severe cold, 
         <line/>and suffered much with rheumatic pains for four days, 
         <line/>but he is now perfectly recovered : he is grown fat. In 
         <line/>
            <mention keyword="settlement description">the river there are thousands of wild swans,
               wild geese</mention>, 
         <line/>wild ducks, woodcocks, snipes, and other wild fowl. If 
         <line/>you were there, you would kill a waggon load in a day, 
         <line/>as I know you have frequently killed a horse load in Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>land ; but they are a thousand times more numerous here 
         <line/>than I ever saw them in England ; this market swarms 
         <line/>with them, and very cheap. No game certificate required 
         <line/>here. Myself, Henry, Mr Blake, and the other passen<sh/>
         
         <line/>gers, visited a French farmer, about six miles below New 
         <line/>Orleans : he has got 3000 acres of his own land, whereon 
         <line/>are sugar plantations, sugar-houses, &amp; c. ; he made 
         <line/>250 hogsheads of molasses of sugar last year. He offers 
         <line/>five hundred acres of good land with his pretty daughter, 
         <line/>as a fortune on her marriage. There are plenty of French 
         <line/>settlements on the banks of the Mississippi ; but they are 
         <line/>the most slovenly and the worst farmers I ever saw. –

            The 
         <line/>Europeans generally leave New Orleans in the summer, 
         <line/>as it is very unhealthy in the hot weather and the 
         <line/>deaths are frequently seventy in a week. The scenery 
         <line/>of this country is very picturesque ; it is very much like 
         <line/>the banks of the river Thames about Richmond and 
         <line/>Staines, and many of the buildings are as handsome as 
         <line/>those of Bath. <mention keyword="religion">Here is one Church</mention>, which is a
            very 
         <line/>beautiful building. On Sunday the French and Spa<sh/>
         
         <line/>nish shops are all open, and it is a market during the 
         <line/>whole day ; balls and the theatre open in the evening, 
         <line/>gambling &amp; c. We are at the Washington Hotel, the 
         <line/>best in the city ; it is expensive, although very good 
         <line/>living here : we pay ten dollars a-week each, including 
         <line/>claret and rum and water. There is no beer here in warm 
         <line/>weather as in England, and it is as warm here now as it 
         <line/>was in England in July, although not half so oppressive 
         <line/>and stinking as it was in Covent Garden during the elec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion : 60 persons dine and sleep in this hotel, most of 
         <line/>them English. We do not trouble ourselves about poli<sh/>
         
         <line/>tics in this country ; our object is to cultivate the soil, 
         <line/>and to reap the fair reward of our labour. On Saturday 
         <line/>we were charged 100 dollars each for passage, and four 
         <line/>dollars six cents for every hundred weight. We have three 
         <line/>and a half tons weight with us. Do pray send me four 
         <line/>quarters of the best peas, rye, grass seed, and some more 
         <line/>of Hill's Scots ploughs, to be left at Messrs Brown and 
         <line/>Co. who will forward them carefully to me at the Illinois. 
         <line/>Mr Trimmer, an Englishman, has purchased 20,000 acres 
         <line/>of land near Mr Birkbeck, and has taken twenty couple of 
         <line/>hounds with him, so that we shall have some hunting as 
         <line/>well as shooting if we like. It is said that he is about to 
         <line/>marry one of Mr B.'s daughters. He is now here : he tells 
         <line/>me that there are plenty of English farmers settled all over 
         <line/>the Illinois territory. He is here to get labourers ; they 
         <line/>are the only thing wanting there. I should have brought 
         <line/>over some with me, but they may follow us ; as I under<sh/>
         
         <line/>stand the labourers, with the pay of a dollar a day, can 
         <line/>live better than a Hampshire or Wiltshire renting farmer 
         <line/>of L.300 or L.400 a year. Mr Riply, and others that I 
         <line/>have seen from Illinois, report that the farmer can 
         <line/>get a sure profit the first year. Mr Ripley says there is 
         <line/>a good sure market, and a fair profit and only one penny 
         <line/>per acre land tax ; this is all the taxes we shall have to 
         <line/>pay. <mention keyword="wages">Price of labour</mention> is very dear here ; we pay a
            dollar 
         <line/>for washing every dozen of shirts, cravats, pocket handker<sh/>
         
         <line/>chiefs, &amp; c. &amp; c. The price of a gallon of best rum is one 
         <line/>and a half dollar. The custom-house duty on my things 
         <line/>shipped from England, I have paid 92 dollars for. Al<sh/>
         
         <line/>though I should like England very well if it was not for 
         <line/>the taxes, yet, from what I have seen hitherto, I like 
         <line/>America ten times better

         <line/>Important Extracts of a Letter from a very Intelligent and re<sh/>
         
         <line/>spectable Engineer in Louisville, dated January 20. 1819. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The best time for coming to America I 
         <line/>should judge to be in the summer, to land in 
         <line/>September, so as to be able to get here before 
         <line/>the weather was too cold. It is safe to 
         <line/>settle in the beginning of winter or spring, so as 
         <line/>to inure to the climate by degrees. The best 
         <line/>plan for coming is to take a part of the steerage 
         <line/>of a vessel, and find your own provisions; you 
         <line/>will save more in this way, over a cabin passage, 
         <line/>than would buy a decent farm here. The lands 
         <line/>in this neighbourhood raise a crop of wheat and 
         <line/>one of corn alternately, and improve ; dung is 
         <line/>never applied, and is said to be hurtful. It is 
         <line/>without question what the land here is as good as 
         <line/>can be, and when to this is added the heat of 
         <line/>the summer, one ought to be able to raise crops 
         <line/>as heavy as they will stand. You wonder at 10 
         <line/>dollars being enough to clear an acre. It is not 
         <line/>cleared, all the trees under 12 inches are cut 
         <line/>down and burned on the ground, and the large 
         <line/>ones are killed by cutting round the bark. The 
         <line/>ground is then prepared for Indian corn by 
         <line/>scratching it with a hoe, or a kind of shuffle, 
         <line/>which, from the looseness and mellowness of the 
         <line/>soil, is easily done, and in this way sixty or 
         <line/>eighty bushels an acre are sometimes raised. – 
         <line/>the trees die in a few months, and in three or 
         <line/>four years fall down one by one, and the roots 
         <line/>will rot out in seven or eight years. It is a 
         <line/>great want of sense in any new settler not to 
         <line/>adopt the modes of this country, proven to be the 
         <line/>best adapted to the state of it by 200 years ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>perience. The Americans, of all other people I 
         <line/>know of, are the most ingenious in adapting the 
         <line/>means to the end. I do not know if they have 
         <line/>more sense than other nations, but they certain<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly make it go farther. Every tools answers the 
         <line/>purpose most effectually. This is evident in their 
         <line/>axes. An American will cut down three times 
         <line/>more trees and square three times more timber 
         <line/>than the best of your wrights could do, and not 
         <line/>by more strength but by fitter tools. So it is 
         <line/>with cutting their grain ; a man will cut down 
         <line/>four acres of wheat in a day, what what he calls 
         <line/>a cradle scythe, and lay it as refular for bind<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing as reapers can do. Sixty bushels of Indian 
         <line/>corn is the average of Kentucky ; but 25 bushels 
         <line/>of wheat is about the average of an acre. It is 
         <line/>easier farming here than with you on sundry ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>counts ; the soil is free, few weeds make their
         <line/>appearance, and when ploughed down are cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tainly killed by the hot sun. There are no frosts 
         <line/>to injure the crop, and no wet weather to de<sh/>
         
         <line/>stroy it when cut. Hay is made in two days, 
         <line/>and grain is cut one day and stacked or housed 
         <line/>the next. From the shortness and mildness of 
         <line/>the winter, little provender is needed for the 
         <line/>stock. Swine are raised at no expence. They 
         <line/>breed and feed in the woods, and only want from 
         <line/>one to three bushels of corn to fatten for killing, 
         <line/>when they sell for five cents a lb. In the less 
         <line/>settled parts of the country, it is the practise to 
         <line/>give all the corn to swine and then send them to 
         <line/>market. A bushel of corn is equal in nutriment 
         <line/>to a bushel of wheat for man or beast.

         <line/>who have been captivated with the speculation of

         <line/>time they have appeared in the streets in fanci<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful uniforms. We understand that Col. Eyre has 
         <line/>formed a Committee, who treat with such young 
         <line/>gentlemen as have the inclination to proceed on 
         <line/>the enterprise, and have money to pay for such 
         <line/>rank as they may wish to possess under M'Gre<sh/>
         
         <line/>gor. The money thus furnished is made a stock 
         <line/>purse to pay the freight of the vessel, and hence 
         <line/>it is necessary that the greater part of the adven<sh/>

         <line/>Advices have been received again from the Cape of 
         <line/>Good Hope of 6th March, which are several days later 
         <line/>than those acquired formerly. Of the rising of the 
         <line/>Caffres there remains no doubt, although it does 
         <line/>not appear that Government have as yet received of<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficial information regarding it. The private accounts 
         <line/>state that two valuable officers had lost their lives, and 
         <line/>also a great number of men. The Governor himself 
         <line/>in order by his presence the sooner to suppress the Caf<sh/>
         
         <line/>fres, had, with a competent force, proceeded to the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terior. Great inconvenience was experienced for the 
         <line/>want of cavalry in so extensive a country ; had not this 
         <line/>been the case, it was believed that in a very few days 
         <line/>tranquility would have been restored. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We are sorry to state that another hurricane has ta<sh/>
         
         <line/>ken place in the Isle of France ; it commenced on the 
         <line/>25th January, and has done great mischief to the ship<sh/>
         
         <line/>ping, and also to the plantations of that ill-fated Is<sh/>
         
         <line/>land.

         <line/>A Dutch mail has arrived, with papers to the 19th 
         <line/>inst. At Batavia, two of the leaders of the late distur<sh/>
         
         <line/>bances have been tried and execute, and that degree 
         <line/>of tranquility which terror produces has been restored. 
         <line/>In the administration of their colonies in the east, the 
         <line/>conduct of the Dutch has always been cruel and op<sh/>
         
         <line/>pressive ; and it is to be regretted that the extensive 
         <line/>and fertile island of Java should have been surrendered 
         <line/>to their rapacity. During the short time that it was in 
         <line/>possession of this country, various important improve<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments were introduced into its domestic administration ; 
         <line/>the practise of torture, according to the humane and 
         <line/>enlightened maxims of British jurisprudence, was abo<sh/>
         
         <line/>lished ; new and better modes of collecting the revenue 
         <line/>were adopted ; and a spirit of mildness and of regard 
         <line/>for the interests of all the various classes of which the 
         <line/>population is composed, was evinced, which made the 
         <line/>British Government highly popular. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Considerable anxiety prevails among the merchants 
         <line/>for the safety of the Queen Charlotte, Jamaica packet. 
         <line/>She sailed from Jamaica the 29th March, and had a 
         <line/>great quantity of specie on board. No things have 
         <line/>since been received of her. Several vessels sailed since 
         <line/>her departure, and have arrived safe. The Ocean quit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted Jamaica on the 6th of April, and arrived here se<sh/>
         
         <line/>veral days since. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Several passengers landed at Portsmouth on Thurs<sh/>
         
         <line/>day from Jamaica, bring Port Royal Papers to the 
         <line/>25th of March. The 50th Regiment had arrived at 
         <line/>Kingston, from Cork ; and the 2nd West India Regi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment was about to embark for Sierra Leone to be dis<sh/>

         <line/>The increased population of this country, as 
         <line/>well as the great difficult to which the mid<sh/>
         
         <line/>dling classes of society are exposed in their ef<sh/>
         
         <line/>forts to procure the ordinary means of suste<sh/>
         
         <line/>nance, has given rise to the formation of little 
         <line/>copartnerships, or joint stock companies of in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dividuals, who, being unable to command capi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tal enough singly, to encounter the expences of 
         <line/>a new settlement, have put their little funds to<sh/>
         
         <line/>gether, with a determination to sail for America, 
         <line/>and there jointly to labour for the general good 
         <line/>of the whole, until fortune shall so far favour 
         <line/>their efforts as to enable them to become inde<sh/>
         
         <line/>pendent of each other. By this means much less 
         <line/>than the hundred pounds stipulated by Mr Birk<sh/>
         
         <line/>beck as the proper stock for an emigrant to be<sh/>
         
         <line/>gin with, will be sufficient ; and thus a new im<sh/>
         
         <line/>petus will be given to that tide of huma beings 
         <line/>which is constantly flowing towards the new 
         <line/>world. Would it not be policy to give encou<sh/>
         
         <line/>ragement to these industrious swarms to settle in 
         <line/>our own colonies? We have heard with some 
         <line/>pleasure in rumour that several parishes have 
         <line/>taken into their serious consideration the pru<sh/>
         
         <line/>dence of establishing a fund for the encourage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of those poor persons who may be dispo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to seek a means of occupation in Canada ; 
         <line/>in furtherance of which laudable design, an ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>plication is to be made to Government for grants 
         <line/>of land in desirable siutations, especially in Up<sh/>
         
         <line/>per Canada, where the climate is described to be 
         <line/>of the finest description. There is no doubt that 
         <line/>many who are now pining in workhouses would 
         <line/>gladly accept of such an alternative, and who, 
         <line/>instead of being, as at present, a burthen to them<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves and to society, would, by their exertions, 
         <line/>be adding to the importance and stability of our 
         <line/>possessions in that quarter, as well as open<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing a new source for the consumption of our ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nufactures.

         <line/>"English Prairie, (Illinoia,) Nov.25. 1818. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"<small_caps>Sir</small_caps> – Your favour of 15th June is before me. 
         <line/>Presuming you retain a copy of the queries, I 
         <line/>proceed to answer then in order: – Respecting 
         <line/>domestic servants ; what may be the condition of 
         <line/>our colony in two years it is impossible to foresee, 
         <line/>but should it be in your power to bring with you 
         <line/>female domestics, it would be well to do so ; also 
         <line/>a carpenter or two and a few labourers ; if with 
         <line/>families, so much the better. Written engage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments for a term, or indentures, are not binding, 
         <line/>unless renewed on this side of the Atlantic. I 
         <line/>have not seen any of these documents, and can 
         <line/>therefore give you no precise directions for them : 
         <line/>perhaps a simple engagement from the parties, 
         <line/>acknowledging as a debt the expence incurred 
         <line/>in bringing our, might be a sufficient security, 
         <line/>leaving their wages to be determined here ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>cording to the current rates, yet to be establish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed by the proportion of supply to the demand, 
         <line/>which, as I remarked above, it is now impossible 
         <line/>to ascertain. As to the number of labourers, or 
         <line/>female domestics, you would need perhaps six of 
         <line/>the former and two of the latter would a safe 
         <line/>adventure, looking to the colony for an ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>dition, should you need it, after you are set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tled – before that you will find a greater num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber an incumbrance : this is, I think, all I 
         <line/>can say to your first, third, fourth, and fifth 
         <line/>queries. All expence of transfer of your fami<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly and luggage, supposing the latter to weigh 
         <line/>ten thousand pounds, I should estimate under 
         <line/>L.1000 sterling. On this particular subject Mr R. Flower 
         <line/>would give you most particular information – 
         <line/>The luggage would cost about ten dollars per 
         <line/>100 lbs. So much for your query. To the se<sh/>
         
         <line/>venth query – I think L.200 would assist your 
         <line/>family in plenty for a year, exclusive of wages 
         <line/>and clothing. Eighth query – L.3000 would be 
         <line/>a good capital for a section, or 640 acres, and I 
         <line/>question your wishing to hold in cultivation a 
         <line/>larger tract. Ninth query – I consider our si<sh/>
         
         <line/>tuation not liable to future disturbance from In<sh/>
         
         <line/>dians, in the event of a war between Great Bri<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain and the United States, being covered by in<sh/>
         
         <line/>creasing settlements to the west, north-west, and 
         <line/>north. Tenth query – The earthquakes men<sh/>
         
         <line/>tioned by Bradbury I have heard of from many 
         <line/>persons ; but I have not discovered that it has 
         <line/>left any impression on the public mind ; on this 
         <line/>score, for my own part, I feel no anxiety about 
         <line/>the matter ; Great Britain, I suppose, in propor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to its dimensions, is equally liable to earth<sh/>
         
         <line/>quakes. Elenventh query, – The route by New Or<sh/>
         
         <line/>leans will, I have no doubt, be preferable to that 
         <line/>by the eastern cities. When due precaution 
         <line/>against the diseases of the climate are observed, 
         <line/>I have never failed to recommend it. Twelfth 
         <line/>query – The health of my family has not suffered 
         <line/>from the climate. One of my sons has been 
         <line/>affected with ague. This summer has been 
         <line/>more sickly in these parts than any season for 
         <line/>seven years past, and has afforded me a most en<sh/>
         
         <line/>couraging confirmation of the temperature and 
         <line/>salubrity of our settlement, and has also afforded 
         <line/>immeasurable proofs of those facts regarding the 
         <line/>sufferings of new settlers, to which I have so 
         <line/>anxiously invited the attention of the readers of 
         <line/>my journal. On the whole, provided common 
         <line/>sense should be seconded by common industry, 
         <line/>in the inclosure and cultivation of our colony, I 
         <line/>think we shall not be visisted by more than our 
         <line/>due share of physical calamity. I deferred no<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticing your second query, the subect being con<sh/>
         
         <line/>nected with the proposal respecting land, at the 
         <line/>conclusion of your letter. I would strongly re<sh/>
         
         <line/>commend your deferring the purchase of land 
         <line/>until your arrival. It would be difficult to con<sh/>
         
         <line/>vey to you the reasons, but you would feel the 
         <line/>propriety of my advice, should you come. I 
         <line/>think you would have as good a choice two 
         <line/>years hence as now, because excellent siutations, 
         <line/>as yet unsurveyed, will then be on sale. I have 
         <line/>no eligible offer to make you beyond a section. 
         <line/>You inquire concerning venomous reptiles ; they 
         <line/>are no source of injury or alarm to us. Insects, 
         <line/>in new countries, often abound to an astonishing 
         <line/>degree, and are sufficiently teazing to man and 
         <line/>beast. Many species yield instantly to cultiva<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, and are heard of no more as plagues ; 
         <line/>others will continue until conquered by order 
         <line/>and industry. The thermometer ranges from 
         <line/>13 below zero to 89 above ; the extremes are, of 
         <line/>course, of rare occurence, and short duration. 
         <line/>At Philadelphia, I understand, it rose this sum<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer 97, and in this neighbourhood, in the low 
         <line/>river bottoms, I believe it might reach that de<sh/>
         
         <line/>gree. On our praire I think it never reached 
         <line/>89. The smaller streams are rapid and soon 
         <line/>dry ; the larger sluggish in the extreme – cat<sh/>
         
         <line/>fish, perch, sturgeons abound, and many others 
         <line/>I believe. I think 1000 dollars would build a 
         <line/>comfortable plain dwelling. – Your obedient ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vant, <small_caps>M. Birkbeck</small_caps>."/&gt;

         <line/>mily, leaving the parish at liverty to make such conditions 
         <line/>with the individual, or the settlers, as may be calculated 
         <line/>to prevent the parish becoming again chargeable with the 
         <line/>maintenance of such settlers, in the event of their return 
         <line/>to this country.

      <p>

         <line/>each family is not infirm or incapable of work.

      <p>
         <line/>It is further proposed, that in any case in which one 
         <line/>hundred families proceed together, and apply for leave to 
         <line/>carry out with them a minister of their own persuasion, 
         <line/>Government will, upon their being actually located, as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sign a salary to the minister who they have may have

         <line/>the party and a number of families, in the proportion of 
         <line/>one for every 100 acres, must have resided on the estate), 
         <line/>the land shall be measured at the expence of Government, 
         <line/>and the holder shall obtain, without fee, his title thereto, 
         <line/>on a perpetual quit rent, not exceeding in any case L. 2 
         <line/>sterling for every 100 acres ; subject, however to this 
         <line/>clause beyond the usual reservations"–that the land shall 
         <line/>become foreited to Government, in case the party shall 
         <line/>abandon the estate, or not bring it into cultivation within 
         <line/>a given number of years. I am

         <line/>A letter from Corfu, dated the 10th ult. states that 
         <line/>the Governor of the Ionian Islands, General Mait<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, embarked on the 8th inst. for Rome, in order to 
         <line/>negotitate a Concordat relative to the Romish Clergy 
         <line/>of the United Islands, as it appeared that Lord Guild<sh/>
         
         <line/>ford, who had been charged with the affair by the 
         <line/>Prince Regent, had failed in his negotiation to that 
         <line/>effect. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Previously to the departure of the Governor, a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>putation from the Parguinotes emigrants waited upon 
         <line/>him, to claim the sum to be paid by Ali Pacha, for 
         <line/>property left in Parga, agreeably to stipulation. Ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral Maitland assured them he would not depart with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out adopting measures in their favour, and immediate<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly issued a proclamation, appointing a commission of 
         <line/>payment. Sir Frederick Adam fills the office of High 
         <line/>Commissioner, <i>ad interim</i>, during the absence of the 
         <line/>Governor. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Advices from Demerara are received to the 3d ult. 
         <line/>The following is from the Guiana Chronicle of the 
         <line/>24th May:–" We observe by St Vincent: papers, 
         <line/>which we have just received, that the Royal York Ran<sh/>
         
         <line/>gers, under the command of Colonel Smelt, had em<sh/>
         
         <line/>barked on board the Diadem and Elizabeth transports 
         <line/>for Canada, where the regiment is intended to be dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>banded. It is stated that each of the men will have a 
         <line/>certain portion of land allotted them in that province 
         <line/>for cultivation and their future support. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We have received Newfoundland Papers to the 23d 
         <line/>ult by which we learn that in the Court of Session, on 
         <line/>the 18th idem, Capt. Redman, of the brig San Do<sh/>
         
         <line/>mingo, from Ross, was ordered to pay a fine of 10l. 
         <line/>each, for 20 passengers brought in that vessel over and 
         <line/>above the number allowed by act of Parliament; and a 
         <line/>further sum of 10l. for not having the regulations re<sh/>
         
         <line/>specting passengers posted up in some conspicuous part 
         <line/>of the vessel ; making in all a fine of 210l. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We subjoin an extract from the Montreal Herald of 
         <line/>the 12th June, relative to Mr Gourlay, the celebrated 
         <line/>reformer: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From the Niagara Spectator, of the 27th May, 
         <line/>we find the far famed champion of civil liberty, Mr 
         <line/>Gourlay, has again made his debut in an address to 
         <line/>the resident landowners of Upper Canada. This pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duction is of the same stamp as him other lucubrations, 
         <line/>abounding with strong and vigorous assertions in place 
         <line/>of facts–a well wove sophistry to beguile the super<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficial reader ; and some of the most egregious errors in 
         <line/>colonial policy recommended with a speciousness well 
         <line/>calculated to deceive. Having so often stated out dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>sent from the political proceeding of this reformer, it 
         <line/>would be deemed intrusive by many of our readers to 
         <line/>enter into a refutation of the tenets, or an exposure of 
         <line/>the absurdities, contained in his address. By others 
         <line/>we might be supposed as exalting over a prostrate foe. 
         <line/>Both imputations we utterly disclaim ; while, as men 
         <line/>we regret that the mad career pursued by Mr Gourlay has 
         <line/>deprived society of the benefits which might have been 
         <line/>reaped from his better talents (of which he doubtless 
         <line/>has a share), we must, as good subjects, feel happy 
         <line/>that his career has been checked without any bad con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sequences to society. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The following is the present distribution of the for<sh/>

         <line/>There are already three extensive settlements on the

         <line/>sua, a considerable river, which is navigable for large 
         <line/>vessels to the Northward. There are also extensive 
         <line/>and fertile lands towards Saldanha Bay. As the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duce from the new colonists will consist of grain and

         <line/>The accounts received on Tuesday from the Cape of

         <line/>Information has just reached Cape Town, that a 
         <line/>detachment of troops, joined by a number of the inha<sh/>
         
         <line/>bitants, who had been sent to suppress the Caffres, had 
         <line/>succeeded in driving them back, and were compelled to 
         <line/>cross the river. The corn districts were in a great 
         <line/>measure cleared of the savages, and the country-people 
         <line/>were returning to their homes, where they considered 
         <line/>themselves secure from any further attacks, at least for 
         <line/>some time to come.

         <line/>Letters have just been received, via Calcutta, from 
         <line/>New South Walves, up to the end of November. The 
         <line/>colony was then all well, and several convict-ships (the 
         <line/>
            <i>Marley, Glory, Mario, Isabella,</i> and others) had ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rived, having made the passage out direct in the short 
         <line/>period of three months and twenty days, and landed 
         <line/>all their convicts and passengers in good health. This 
         <line/>may be considered as another, among many proofs, that 
         <line/>it is unnecessary to make any stay at any intermediate

         <line/>We are sorry to state that another most distressing 
         <line/>and calamitous fire has taken place at St. John's New<sh/>
         
         <line/>foundland. Captain Critchelly, of the alliance, arriv-[?] 
         <line/>ed at Liverpool from Carbonear, in Newfoundland, [?] 
         <line/>which he left on the 22d ult. states that a fire broke 
         <line/>out in an uninhabited house in St. John's between one 
         <line/>and two o'clock in the morning of the 18th of June 
         <line/>and that from the inflammable nature of the house[?] 
         <line/>and more particularly of their roofs, it spread with such 
         <line/>rapidity, that in the short space of three hours 170 fa-[?] 
         <line/>milies were burnt out, besides an immense quantity

         <line/>houses.

         <line/>We learn from another account, that the fire destroy<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed the whole of the old part of the town. It broke out 
         <line/>near Conder and Tracy's store, and burnt all between

         <line/>At the present moment, under the prospect of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration, all intelligence coming from this quarter is of 
         <line/>peculiar interest. The letters which reached town [?] 
         <line/>Tuesday, mention that the Caffres had commenced [?] 
         <line/>tilities anew, and that their numbers were very consi<sh/>
         
         <line/>derable. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Cape Town, May 5. 
         <line/>The Caffres have broken out, and a very serious war 
         <line/>is carried on at present on the borders. It is said 
         <line/>that the savages are to the amount of 50,000, and a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>tachment of 6000 attacked Graham's Town on Satur<sh/>
         
         <line/>day week, about 12 o'clock in the day, but were re<sh/>
         
         <line/>pulsed, and 150 left dead on the fiel. They carried 
         <line/>off 500 wounded. Orders have been issued in every 
         <line/>district of the colony for the young boors to inrol them<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves to oppose the enemy.

         <line/>Cape Town, May 16. 
         <line/>The 13th regiment, commanded by Colonel Wil<sh/>
         
         <line/>shire have come up with the main body of Caf<sh/>
         
         <line/>fres, near Graham's Town and have defeated them with 
         <line/>great loss. Since then they have withdrawn from the 
         <line/>British territory. The 54th regiment arrived at [?] 
         <line/>place a few days ago from England and have since[?] 
         <line/>marched off for the frontiers. A large number of in<sh/>
         
         <line/>fantry have been mounted on horseback to [?] 
         <line/>them to pursue more effectually the savages. They are 
         <line/>all in excellent spirits. It is reported that our present 
         <line/>Governor is going home, and that another has been ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointed.

         <line/>Jamaica Papers to the 10th ultimo has reached us, 
         <line/>which confirms the sad accounts of the miserable fate of 
         <line/>the followers of the fugitive M'Gregor. It appears 
         <line/>that the schooner Marsha[?] had brought accounts from 
         <line/>San Blas[?], that M'Gregor, after his disgraceful flight 
         <line/>from Porto Bello, proceeded[?] in the brig Hero, for St. 
         <line/>Andreas, where he arrived on the 7th of May, and left 
         <line/>on the 12th, having suffered considerably from the ef<sh/>
         
         <line/>fects of his leap. He promulgated a story that he had 
         <line/>been betrayed by some of his Officers, who had [?] 
         <line/>Porto Bello ; but added he would soon receive rein<sh/>

         <line/>lions of dollars at Rio Janeiro, from Litna[?] and brought 
         <line/>to England about 140,000 on merchants' account. She, 
         <line/>and the Andromache, Captain Shirreff, having [?] 
         <line/>treasure on board, passed Lord Cochrane's squadron, 
         <line/>in the South Seas, but his Lordship did not discover 
         <line/>even the slightest intention of interrupting either of the 
         <line/>ships. His Lordship's squadron appeared in excellent 
         <line/>order ; and it is but justice to his Lordship to state, 
         <line/>that he has not resorted to any undue or improper 
         <line/>means to man his ships ; but on the contrary in every 
         <line/>instance of complaint made to him by the mas<sh/>
         
         <line/>ters of merchant shipping, of any of their crew having 
         <line/>deserted to him, he ordered the men to be again in<sh/>
         
         <line/>stantly sent on board their respective ships.

         <line/>(From Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has submitted to 
         <line/>Parliament the expediency of voting &#x163;50,000 towards 
         <line/>the encouragement of emigration to the Cape of Good 
         <line/>Hope. Let it be remembered, once for all, that it is 
         <line/>not because that colony is too thin of inhabitants, but 
         <line/>that the mother country is too full, that this plan is sug<sh/>
         
         <line/>gested. The question is not how you maintain 
         <line/>a surplus peasantry in the land that gave them birth, 
         <line/>but, whether you will stop emigration to the frozen 
         <line/>shores of Canada, and to the United States, or divert 
         <line/>and encourage it to the finest colony in the world – 
         <line/>We surely have learnt enough of North America to 
         <line/>convince us of the degraded and miserable conditions of 
         <line/>its people. South African, on the other hand, has every 
         <line/>advantage to repay the sacrifice of quitting the land of 
         <line/>our forefathers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The more fully to understand and appreciate these 
         <line/>advantages, we shall set before our readers a short view 
         <line/>of the conditions and facilities of the colony in ques<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The spring, from September to December, is the 
         <line/>most agreedable season. The summer, from December 
         <line/>to March, is often intensely hot. The autumn, from 
         <line/>March to June, is generally fine and pleasant. The 
         <line/>winter is rainy and stormy, and for the most part so 
         <line/>cold as to make fires very comfortable during the 
         <line/>months of July, August, and September. Most of the 
         <line/>diseases that appear among the natives proceed rather 
         <line/>from their gross and indolent modes of living, than the 
         <line/>unheathliness of the climate. The scarcity of water in 
         <line/>summer is unfavourable to cultivation ; and for want 
         <line/>of industry or materials this defect is not remedied, as 
         <line/>it is in India, by artificial tanks or reservoirs. When<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever, however, irrigation can be employed, either from 
         <line/>wells or rivers, the most abundant vegetation ensues. 
         <line/>Good and abundant water has always been found by 
         <line/>digging wells in Cape Town and the vicinity. In the 
         <line/>whole colony there is scarcely a river that can be called 
         <line/>navigable. Though swollen into torrents during the 
         <line/>winter, most of them dry up during the summer. All 
         <line/>the rivers are well stocked with perch, eels and small 
         <line/>turtle ; and with a certain distance from the coast 
         <line/>they abound with the several fish peculiar to these seas. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There is general want of wood in South Africa – 
         <line/>At the distance, however, of 1.5 miles from Algoa bay 
         <line/>there is a large forest of a many thousand acres. Some 
         <line/>of these trees (taxus elongatus) grow to the amazing 
         <line/>size of 10 feet in diameter, and to the height of 30 or 
         <line/>40 feet of trunk clear of branches. The wood is use<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful for many purposes, but will not bear exposure to 
         <line/>weather. The iron-wood grows to the size of 3 feet 
         <line/>in diameter and the trunk straight and very high – 
         <line/>The Hassayni wood is a beautiful tree... 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Constantia wine is known throughout Europe, 
         <line/>and to what perfection the other wines of the colony 
         <line/>are capable of being brought, may very fairly be au<sh/>
         
         <line/>gured for the great improvement that has already ta<sh/>
         
         <line/>ken place in its manufacture. Heretofore, the Dutch 
         <line/>farmer and the merchant have regarded more the quan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tity than the quality of their wine. And when a car<sh/>
         
         <line/>go was once shipped, it mattered little to them, whe<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther sound or sour it reached its destination. Little 
         <line/>care was taken in the growth of the vine ; the branches 
         <line/>were permitted to rest upon the groun ; while decay<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed and unripe grapes, stalks and leaves, were all pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>miscuously thrown in the wine-press. The mode 
         <line/>also of seasoning the casks with brimstone, and the 
         <line/>want of good brandy to fit it for foreign markets, have 
         <line/>all contributed to deteriorate the character and confine 
         <line/>the sale of Cape Madeira. These defects have lately 
         <line/>been in a great measure remedied. Proper persons 
         <line/>have been sent out from Madeira and this country, and 
         <line/>every care seems now taken to meet and secure the 
         <line/>growing demand in European markets. The trifling 
         <line/>duty affixed to Cape Madeira in this country, has been 
         <line/>the means of introducing it into many families, which 
         <line/>have hitherto used home-made wines. And though the 
         <line/>merchants at Madeira have made many remonstrances 
         <line/>on this preference, it surely is but equitable that en<sh/>
         
         <line/>couragement should be given to the stape export of a 
         <line/>colony, now decidely, and we must trust unalterably, Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>lish. But in addition to wines there are other articles 
         <line/>of colonial growth, exported to the East Indies, Eu<sh/>
         
         <line/>rope, and America. Grain, wool, bides, and skins, 
         <column/>
         <line/>whale oil and bone, dried fruits, salt provisions, soap 
         <line/>and candles, aloes, tobacco. Such are the articles of 
         <line/>commerce that might be turned to the best account. – 
         <line/>But neither trade nor prosperit of any kind will con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tinue to thrive in this colony, under the present mode 
         <line/>of administering its government and laws. It has been 
         <line/>said, that despotism would be the best of governments 
         <line/>were the despot virtuous. This may be ; but conti<sh/>
         
         <line/>tuted as human nature is, we fear that the purest a<sh/>
         
         <line/>mongst us needs some control. Control, however, 
         <line/>there is none over the governor at the Cape. He makes 
         <line/>and annuls laws at pleasure. He inserts a proclama<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion in the Cape Gazette, and from that moment <i>his</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>fiat</i> becomes the law of the land. He has indeed an 
         <line/>adviser in the colonial secretary, whose influence does 
         <line/>not extend beyond that of mere advice. Strange to 
         <line/>add, the laws at the Cape are at this moment Dutch 
         <line/>laws, rescinded and obscured by all the edicts of the 
         <line/>different governors of the colony. All pleadings are 
         <line/>in writing, and were, till laterly, carried on, <i>foribus</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>clausis</i>. In 1797 a court of appeal for criminal and 
         <line/>civil cases was established, over both of which the go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernor presides. In India, in the West Indies, and in 
         <line/>Canada, there is a governor and a council. These act 
         <line/>as checks upon each other. But at the Cape there is 
         <line/>no appeal beyond the governor. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The taxes, however, at the Cape, under which we 
         <line/>groan so painfully in this country, are comparatively 
         <line/>trifling. European luxuries very justly pay a heavy 
         <line/>import duty, but their purchase is matter of choice.– 
         <line/>This falls not upon the poor, not consequently will it 
         <line/>fall upon those most likely to emigrate under the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions of the Parliamentary grant. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Noting indeed can be framed with greater care and 
         <line/>precautions, than the encouragement bedd out in Mr 
         <line/>Vansittuart's proposal. A small deposit, L. 10. is to be 
         <line/>made at the colonial office in Downing Street, by each 
         <line/>individual. A free passage is to be granted, and on 
         <line/>reaching the Cape, this deposit is to be returned to the 
         <line/>settler by the local government. And such is the li<sh/>
         
         <line/>berality that has guided the proposed plans, it is more<sh/>
         
         <line/>over stipulated, that if 100 families should agree to 
         <line/>emigrate, and their minister with them, not only 
         <line/>permission will be granted them so to do, but provi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion will be made for him. The separation from coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try and from kindred is thus softened, and it will allay 
         <line/>many a sorrowing regret and painful recollection that 
         <line/>in distant lands, and amongst a strange people, the 
         <line/>settler may still listen to the voice and instruction of a 
         <line/>pastor, to whom custom, veneration, and affection, have 
         <line/>all united to attach him. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It appears that the experiment of a settlement of Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>lish, has already been made upon a limited plan at 
         <line/>Saldanha Bay (the finest harbour in South Africa) : 
         <line/>and with such success as to give the best encourage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment to a more extensive emigration. Indeed, from 
         <line/>what we have outselves seen of the colony and its great 
         <line/>facilities, we have no doubt whatever of the benefits 
         <line/>that must arise to the sober, steady exertions of the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dustrious. At the Cape, or elsewhere, poverty and 
         <line/>misery will attend the vicious and indolent, but 
         <line/>certain we are, that there is no country under heaven, 
         <line/>where the poor may find a safer asylum, and where ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>tivity, economy and good conduct, will meet with so 
         <line/>certain and full a reward. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>During the stay of the 93rd regiment of foot (a 
         <line/>Scotch regiment) at the Cape, many of the privates 
         <line/>were known to save the whole of their pay, and were 
         <line/>thus enabled to return to England with a very hand 
         <line/>some little fortune. English servants of all descrip<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions are in great request, and 1.5 sterling a month are 
         <line/>no uncommon wages for a tolerable cook. It is never<sh/>
         
         <line/>theless to beremember, that clothes of all kinds are 
         <line/>expensive at the Cape, as no manufactory is permitted, 
         <line/>lest it should injure the trade of this country. Still 
         <line/>farmers in the country dress very coarsely and cheaply ; 
         <line/>and their wives and daughters, except on Sunday, are 
         <line/>humbly clad as themselves. Indeed, in so soft a 
         <line/>climate as the Cape, there is that occasion for mul<sh/>
         
         <line/>tiplicity and warmth of apparel which colder regions 
         <line/>require. For three-fourths of the year, the best bed is 
         <line/>a hard mattress with a single coverlet. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There is point which we cannot pass over ; as 
         <line/>we think it very intimately connected with the virtue 
         <line/>and happiness of the settlers. And that is, the educa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of their children. Nothing is more neglected than 
         <line/>this in Southern Africa. The boors, (farmers) are 
         <line/>ignorant to a degree passing credence. With the mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nister that is to accompany 100 families, it would be 
         <line/>highly expedient to send a few sober intelligent men as 
         <line/>schoolmasters. Attempts have been lately made to in<sh/>
         
         <line/>troduce into the colony the Madras system of instruc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, and a free school upon that plan has been esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blished at Cape Town, with considerable success. Still 
         <line/>the natives are stubbornly averse to instruction. Their 
         <line/>luxurious and bountiful climate supplies them with all 
         <line/>the necessaries of human life, and beyond this they 
         <line/>have neither wish nor ambition. But if knowledge has 
         <line/>its fruits, ignorance has its weeds. The savage and 
         <line/>unparalleled cruelties that have heretofore been ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ercised towards their slaves and the Hottentot servants 
         <line/>by these Dutch boors may very fairly be traced to want 
         <line/>of education, as a main cause. The unjust limits 
         <line/>shown by the Dutch laws to the <i>white</i> man's barbari<sh/>
         
         <line/>ties have doubtless encouraged their perpetration – 
         <line/>Cruelty is not the character of Englishmen, and, there<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore, too much care cannot be taken to guard the fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>milies of the new settlers against the contagion of the 
         <line/>inhumanities that they must see practised around them, 
         <line/>and how far an early and thorough acquaintance with 
         <line/>our duty to God and man will counteract this influence 
         <line/>aided a knowledge of common school attainments, 
         <line/>we need not say. The 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We have thrown these remarks together more as 
         <line/>loose hints for the consideration of our readers, than 
         <line/>with any idea of furnishing a complete view of so wide 
         <line/>and important a subject. We may be induced here<sh/>
         
         <line/>after to review the question more in detail. The plan 
         <line/>itself, as confessed by the Chanceller of the Exchequer, 
         <line/>has at present assumed a very imperfect shape. Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>rice we have not seen, and can only speak from the 
         <line/>reports of other. Those reports are sufficiently dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>couraging. On the contrary, all who have seen and 
         <line/>described the Cape, have united in praising it. Food 
         <line/>is cheap and abundant, the price of labour is exceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ingly high, trade is important and increasing, many 
         <line/>parts of the colony are beautiful, and its climate is 
         <line/>mild and healthy. There are few countries upon earth 
         <line/>where so many components of happiness will be found 
         <line/>to concentrate.

         <line/>British Government, 2,748,000 acres, stretching from 
         <line/>the upper part of the midland[?] district towards the lower 
         <line/>part of the province, in the rear of the old settlements 
         <line/>on the Ottawa, and not in any manner coming into 
         <line/>contact with or approach within many miles of the 
         <line/>boundary of Louisiana. Yet, upon the supposition 
         <line/>that Great Britain is thus extending her Canadian ter<sh/>
         
         <line/>ritory, the American Papers are loud in their invectives 
         <line/>against this country.

      <p>
         <line/>Letters have been received from Mogadoru[?], dated 
         <line/>the 28th September, which mention, that the plague 
         <line/>which had been for some time in the vicinity, had at 
         <line/>length broken out in that town. We are happy to add 
         <line/>however, that the deaths at that period were only three 
         <line/>or four each day, and it was then confined to the 
         <line/>Moors ; none of the Christians or Jews having fallen 
         <line/>victims to the pestilence. The weather being extreme<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly cold, great hopes were entertained that the further 
         <line/>progress of the disease would speedily be put a stop to 
         <line/>when trade, which then at a stand, would renew 
         <line/>its wanted[?] activity. The whole population of Moga<sh/>
         
         <line/>doru is between 10 and 12,000 persons ; by far the 
         <line/>greater part of whom consider it contrary to their reli<sh/>
         
         <line/>gious tenets to use any caution to prevent their taking 
         <line/>the infection ; and, in the event of their having it 
         <line/>would not, for the same reason, have recourse to any 
         <line/>means to counteract it.

         <line/>[ From the Observer. ] 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The following letter from a lady who emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted to America, from within four miles of Godal<sh/>
         
         <line/>ming, in Surrey, two years back, has been hand<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to us for insertion. During the present rage 
         <line/>for emigration, we think we are justified in giv<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing it insertion, leaving it to those who are inte<sh/>
         
         <line/>rested in its contents to draw their own con 
         <line/>clusions. We have reason to conclude that the 
         <line/>letter is genuine, and is not, we believe, as many 
         <line/>have been which have found their way into the 
         <line/>public press, the produce of ingenuity on this 
         <line/>side the Atlantic: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Philadelphia, July 29. 1818 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"My dear Sir – I have received your welcome letter, to<sh/>
         
         <line/>gether with the patterns you were kind enough to forward 
         <line/>Although our habits here are in many respects different from 
         <line/>those on your side of the Atlantic, yet, I assure, there is a 
         <line/>considerable degree of anxiety among our American belles for 
         <line/>English fasions ; and the display which your prompt atten<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion to my request has enabled me to make, has procured me 
         <line/>not alone a great influx of visitors, but of business. You ask 
         <line/>me to give you my candid opinion of the policy of removing 
         <line/>hither with your wife and family. I can have no hesitation in 
         <line/>complying with this request ; but, at the same time, I shrink 
         <line/>from the responsibility of your being persuade, from any 
         <line/>things which I may say, to follow my example. It is impossible 
         <line/>to disguise from myself, and I would not attempt to disguise 
         <line/>it from you, that many who have come here, anticipating pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>sperity and independence, have failed ; but, at the same time, 
         <line/>as far as my humble observation has enabled me to judge, I 
         <line/>am persuaded that many of those failures have been the result 
         <line/>of unpardonable imprudence, and the absence of that activity 
         <line/>and spirit of perseverance, by which persons depending on 
         <line/>their own exertions can alone expect to succeed. I have seen 
         <line/>many individuals here reduced to very melancholy straits from 
         <line/>having left their native shores thoughtlessly, without more 
         <line/>money than was sufficient to support them for a fortnight. –. 
         <line/>This has been dissipated, on their landing, almost before they 
         <line/>had recovered the effects of a long and fatiguing voyage ; and 
         <line/>being thus reduced to extremity, their spirits have failed, and 
         <line/>they have at once sunk into a state of apathy and listless de<sh/>
         
         <line/>spair. Those who have labouring and mechanic trades to 
         <line/>follow, and will sumbit to degradation, as some of them 
         <line/>call it, of becoming journeymen, do tolerably well. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"With regards to myself, I need not recall to your mind the 
         <line/>species of drudgery to which I was forced to submit, in order 
         <line/>to support a decent appearance in London. You often joked 
         <line/>me on my enterprising disposition, and doubted my resolution 
         <line/>to come to this country in search of that independence which 
         <line/>I foresaw I could never obtain at home. Here I am, however, 
         <line/>and an hour since I had the pleasure of paying 30 work wo<sh/>
         
         <line/>men, the lowest of whose weekly wages, I those who 
         <line/>take their work home, is five dollars! You will start at this 
         <line/>and so will Mrs B. It is, however, no less true than extraordi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nary. In short I have every reason to be grateful to Providence 
         <line/>for having given me the confidence to sufficient to try an experiment 
         <line/>which has turned out so fortunately. I have commenced both 
         <line/>millinery and dress-making, to which I have added the child<sh/>
         
         <line/>bed and ready made linen business ; and in every one of 
         <line/>branches I am full of orders. My most sanguine hopes 
         <line/>have been realized. My capital at the beginning was exactly 
         <line/>1.60 Sterling and a few of those articles of stock which 
         <line/>were necessary to make a show. These, combined with the 
         <line/>attractive titled of " Miss P–, from London,'&amp;c. in a 
         <line/>few weeks set me afloat in a surprising manner. I did my 
         <line/>utmost to please my customers, and, in a few months, moved 
         <line/>from a situation of obscurity to one of the first respecta<sh/>
         
         <line/>bility. I am thus particular because I know you feel an 
         <line/>interest in my fate. My brother James, who you know 
         <line/>is a bricklayer and builder, has been equally fortunate.– 
         <line/>He has had several contracts, and is now building a row of 
         <line/>twenty houses, besides other jobs of a smaller description. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Of the other fiften persons who accompanied us from 
         <line/>Godalmbing and its neighbourhood I am proud to say they 
         <line/>have all been tolerably successful. The greater part of them, 
         <line/>you know, were farmers, and they are now settled in farms 
         <line/>of from fifty to five hundred acres, from one hundred to one 
         <line/>thousand miles from this place. All these, hoever, came 
         <line/>out with small capitals–but none with less than myself–and 
         <line/>husbanding their resources, and abstaining from extravagance 
         <line/>of every description, they finally successed in laying the 
         <line/>foundation of their own future happiness. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We all have our own prejudices in favour of our old habits ; 
         <line/>but this must wear off in the course of timeȃother there 
         <line/>is a roughness and absence of what we call "good manners"/&gt;
         <line/>about some of the Americans, not at all congenial to English 
         <line/>taste. They are for the most part, however, hospitable ; 
         <line/>and if you let them have their way, and do not thwart their 
         <line/>humours, are really very kind, and disposed to friendly inter<sh/>
         
         <line/>course. You talk to carrying your family to the Western 
         <line/>states–to the Illinois country, and of commencing farmer 
         <line/>and storekeeping there. It is probably that your views may be 
         <line/>very correct, but I think you may settle nearer to us, if not 
         <line/>at so cheap a rate, at best with a greater certainty of present 
         <line/>comfort. Of the Western States, I, of course, can know no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing but by report. The emigration in that direction has 
         <line/>been immense, but the journey to some has been so long, as 
         <line/>frequently to produce repentance before the destined goal was 
         <line/>reached. We have had several English, Scotch, and Irish fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>milies here, on the way to Pittsburgh, who, I understand, 
         <line/>were bound for Mr Birkbeck's settlement ; but I have not 
         <line/>heard of their arrival. The greater part have gone down the 
         <line/>Ohio in arks, which you say you have seen described in Birk<sh/>
         
         <line/>beck's books. No doubt these people must have to encounter 
         <line/>great privations, and perhaps some danger ; time and perseve<sh/>
         
         <line/>rance, however,will overcome all difficulties, and from the na<sh/>
         
         <line/>tural course of things, in the end the great object in view, plenty 
         <line/>and independence, must be attained ; and this as you very 
         <line/>justly say, is "worth a struggle." Upon the whole, if you can 
         <line/>be content to give up all those luxuries of which an English 
         <line/>fireside is the scene ; to abandon the habits of social inter<sh/>
         
         <line/>course to which an English neighbourhood give encou<sh/>
         
         <line/>ragement ; and to derive happiness from the consciousness of 
         <line/>seeing yourself surrounded by an abundance of the necessaries 
         <line/>of life alone ; you cannot fail of success. I agree with you, 
         <line/>that a vast deal of the pleasure of England are counterbalan<sh/>
         
         <line/>ced by the castant visitation of the tax-gathered. From these, 
         <line/>at least you will be free here ; and as for society, your own 
         <line/>family, large as it is, must be a treasure in itself ; added to 
         <line/>which, in proportion as wealth increases, civilisation must 
         <line/>follow. If you could get three or four families with whom 
         <line/>you are acquainted, to join in your plans and settle in your 
         <line/>neighbourhood, an additional assuance of success and happi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness would be attained. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"As to capital, I think you ought to hav, on your land<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing here, L. 500, which, with moderate exertions and com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mon good fortune, must afford yo uthe means of certain 
         <line/>prosperity. I shall, however, write again in September on 
         <line/>this subject, when I intend sending for my sister, and per<sh/>
         
         <line/>haps the information I may be able to collect in the interim 
         <line/>will confirm your plans, and induce you to accompany her to 
         <line/>this side of the water. I rather think we shall shortly have 
         <line/>another cargo from Surrey ; I will let you know every parti<sh/>
         
         <line/>cular in my next, as well as send you a list of the things, 
         <line/>which it will be policy for you to bring with you. Your 
         <line/>seven children, instead of being a burden to you here, will 
         <line/>form one of the most prominent sources of your wealth."/&gt;

            <small_caps>Emigration to Canada</small_caps>. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>About ten days ago an emigrant arrived from 
         <line/>Canada, to Paisley, and brings very favourable 
         <line/>intelligence from that country. He is a native 
         <line/>of Scotland ; was some time in the army ; and 
         <line/>is going home again, as he calls it, early in the 
         <line/>spring. This person gives the most satisfactory 
         <line/>and cheering account of the place, and says his 
         <line/>chief complaint was the want of society to share 
         <line/>in his felicities, to be companion of his joys, and 
         <line/>to exult in his abundance. He adds that one of 
         <line/>his principal reasons for coming here at present 
         <line/>was hearing of our distressed condition, and 
         <line/>that he might be able to persuade others to follow his ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ample ; anxious to be surrounded by happy, in<sh/>
         
         <line/>telligent, and social neighbours. His arrival and 
         <line/>narrations, combined with other circumstances, 
         <line/>have been the subject of considerable discussion 
         <line/>the whole of last week. A strong desire 
         <line/>for emigration has been manifested, and about 
         <line/>300 have already subscribed their names, as a 
         <line/>testimony of their ardour to go away. A peti<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion is immediately to be forwarded to his Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>jesty's Ministers, imploring their assistance by 
         <line/>way of loan or donation, to enable them to carry 
         <line/>their wishes into execution. This petition, it is 
         <line/>said, is to be supported by the principal gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>men of the county, and the utmost anxiety 
         <line/>will doubtless prevail concerning its success. – 
         <line/>Let us hope that Government will see the neces<sh/>
         
         <line/>sity of attending to the supplications of these 
         <line/>people. The Sheriff Depute has been memoriali<sh/>
         
         <line/>zed upon the subject, to give his counsel and sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>port in behalf of the measure, and it is much to 
         <line/>his honour that he has evinced a great disposition 
         <line/>to favour the object in view. His office has 
         <line/>been appointed for the reception of signatures, 
         <line/>where the persons experience the greatest kind<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness in every possible way. It is proper, at the 
         <line/>same time, to mention, that a number who were 
         <line/>wishing to subscribe as desirous to emigrate, have 
         <line/>been rejected ; as their circumstances were not 
         <line/>of that despairing nature as to warrant an inter<sh/>
         
         <line/>position of this kind in their favour. It cannot 
         <line/>be expected that those who enjoy a considerable 
         <line/>degree of comfort at home, or who have sufficient 
         <line/>means of their own to emigrate without public 
         <line/>aid, ought to be included among that number des<sh/>
         
         <line/>tined to participate in this salutary and benevo<sh/>
         
         <line/>lent proposition. Some of the fiercer radicals, with 
         <line/>their accustomed zeal and spleen, are busily em<sh/>
         
         <line/>ployed in jeering and deprecating the idea of 
         <line/>emigration and telling the " people to stay and 
         <line/>help" in the recovery of their rights. They de<sh/>
         
         <line/>clare the whole scheme to be a mere farce, in<sh/>
         
         <line/>tended to be played against them, in order to 
         <line/>destroy the unanimity which they say exists in 
         <line/>the nation concerning their grand object. These 
         <line/>querulous politicians complain of the climate of 
         <line/>Canada, and it must be granted that it resembles 
         <line/>Italy more than Scotland, being hotter in sum<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer and coller in winter than our own island 
         <line/>but the country is healthy, the soil is fruitful 
         <line/>and strong constitutions and longevity are as 
         <line/>common there as in any other part of the globe. 
         <line/>The same manners, language, and regulations 
         <line/>prevail in Upper Canada as in Scotland, and 
         <line/>when people have plenty of provisions, fuel and 
         <line/>warm clothing to resist the effects of heavy snows 
         <line/>and intense frosts, the objection of cold is less 
         <line/>worthy of consideration. – <i>Glasgow Chronicle</i>.

         <line/>(From Lavaysse's Account of Venezuela, Trinidad, Mar<sh/>

         <line/>Stedman, after having given a picture of the cruelties 
         <line/>practised on the negroes at Surinam, relates that on his 
         <line/>arrival in that colony, a white man was flagged by a black 
         <line/>executioner, for having stolen some money from the town<sh/>
         
         <line/>house ; and he remarked that this negro inflicted the pu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nishment with great signs of commiseration. A negro 
         <line/>was broken on the wheel for the same crime, and he bore 
         <line/>that horrible punishment without a sigh. A moment af<sh/>
         
         <line/>terwards, they prepared to hang another, and whilst the 
         <line/>hangman was tying the cord round his neck to launch him 
         <line/>into eternity, he looked steadfastly, with a smile of con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tempt, at his judges, who were among the spectators of the 
         <line/>execution. " Having expressed to the persons who were 
         <line/>near me, (says Captain Stedman) how much I was shock<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with the injustice and cruelty of those executions, 
         <line/>and surprised at the intrepidity of the negroes during the 
         <line/>punishment, a very decent looking man thus addressed 
         <line/>me ; Sir, you are newly arrived from Europe ; but if you 
         <line/>were better acquainted with negro slaves, what you now 
         <line/>see would neither excite your surprise nor your pity. It 
         <line/>is not long since I saw a negro suspended from that very 
         <line/>gibbet by the ribs. The following is the manner in which 
         <line/>it was done : two incisions were made in his side, in which 
         <line/>was passed an iron hook attached to a chain. He lived 
         <line/>three days suspended in that manner, his head and feet 
         <line/>hanging down, licking from his bleeding breast the drops 
         <line/>of water that fell on it, for it rained at the time. The 
         <line/>sufferer did not, however, utter a groan, and never once 
         <line/>complained. On the third day, another negro was flogged 
         <line/>under the gallows, and having cried from pain, the former 
         <line/>reproached him for his want of courage: " Are you a 
         <line/>man?" said he to him, " you behave like a child!" – 
         <line/>A moment afterwards the soldier who was sentry 
         <line/>on the spot taking pity on him, dashed out his brains 
         <line/>with the butt end of his musquet. " I saw another 
         <line/>negro quartered," the narrator: " After his 
         <line/>arms and legs were tied to four very strong horses, an 
         <line/>iron nail was driven under each nail of his hands and feet 
         <line/>He suffered that without complaining, requested a glass of 
         <line/>ru,, and ordered the executioners to let loose the horses. 
         <line/>But that which amused us most," continued this monster, 
         <line/>"was the humour of the fellow, who, when the hangman 
         <line/>presented the glass of rum to him that he had asked for, 
         <line/>told him to drink first, as he was very much afraid of be<sh/>
         
         <line/>poisoned, and desired him to take care that his horses 
         <line/>should not kick him. As for old negroes being broken on 
         <line/>the wheel, and young women burnt alive, nothing is more 
         <line/>common in this colony!"/&gt;

            <small_caps>Mr Birkbeck's Settlement</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A small pamphlet has lately been published, consisting of letters 
         <line/>and extracts of letters from Mr Birkbeck, of which we have been procured 
         <line/>a copy. The author's object appears chiefly to have been to counter<sh/>
         
         <line/>act the misrepresentations circulated on the subject of the settlement 
         <line/>by Cobbett. We read Cobbett's remarks when they were first trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted to this country, and certainly did not think them worthy of the 
         <line/>notice here bestowed upon them. His objections to the new settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, helped out as they were misquotation and misconstruction, 
         <line/>were of very little weight, except in so far as they applied to all emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration whatever ; and they had really nothing to render them worth 
         <line/>reading, but the sarcasm and caustic humour which accompanied 
         <line/>them. We should, therefore, have been better pleased had Mr Birk<sh/>
         
         <line/>beck allowed this restless controversist to wallow in the mire of his own 
         <line/>endless contradiction, and rather given us some more details regard<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the settlement. The Americans are every year pushing forward 
         <line/>into the wilderness ; but it is a new thing for a body of our country<sh/>
         
         <line/>men, when withdrawing from a society richly provided with all the 
         <line/>accomodations which wants of civilized life render necessary 
         <line/>to pass through the settled and cultivated parts of the New World 
         <line/>and to retire to the untrodden waste a thousand miles from the sea 
         <line/>Though the activity of commerce carries many of the convenienes 
         <line/>and even luxuries of life to this remote place, still the settlers must 
         <line/>find such a difference in their situation as must subject them to go ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>ny privations ; and some details, shewing how the colonists got over 
         <line/>their difficulties, how their various wants were supplied, and how the 
         <line/>feelings and habits of civilized life accommodated themselves to the 
         <line/>woods and the wilderness, would have been much more interesting 
         <line/>than a reply to Cobbett's captious objections. One of the most try<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing privations of the colony seems to be a want of wives, an evil 
         <line/>which happily does not affect the mother country, amidst all her other 
         <line/>sufferings. The evil has probably been aggravated by some of the co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonists forgetting to take their wives with them. If matters don't 
         <line/>get better in this particular, we may expect to hear of some of the 
         <line/>adjoining American towns suffering a Sabine spoliation. A cargo 
         <line/>of young ladies would evidently be one of the best mercantile specu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lations ; and as our own city had surplus of ten or twelve thousand 
         <line/>females at the last census, we have no doubt that some of our enter<sh/>
         
         <line/>prising export traders will take the hint, and, by scouring the board<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing-schools, complete a choice assortment, adapted to the Illinois 
         <line/>market. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The following extracts the only parts that appear to have any 
         <line/>general interest. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"<i>English Prairie, July</i> 13. 1819. 
         <line/>"My Friends and Countrymen,–For your service I exhibited, in 
         <line/>two publications, an outline of the process of emigration, from its 
         <line/>commencement up to the final settlement. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"My first opinion of this, the spot of our choice, and the reasoning 
         <line/>on which that choice was grounded, are before you ; and sufficient 
         <line/>time has elapsed to try those opinnions by the test of experience, by 
         <line/>which they are confirmed in every important particular. I showed 
         <line/>you my own tract through the gloomy forest into a delightful coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, better prepared for an abode by the hand of nature than the heavy 
         <line/>woods by half a century of labour. I built me a cabin, and "belayed 
         <line/>a road to it;" for it was my ambition to be surrounded by my old 
         <line/>friends and neighbours. In this, too, I am gratified ; and we are con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tented with out allotment, both as to our present state and future 
         <line/>prospects. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"This small district, which two years ago was nearly without inha<sh/>
         
         <line/>bitants, contains a thriving population of from six to seven hundred 
         <line/>persons. We have been blessed with health most unusual for a new 
         <line/>settlement, or for any settlement of equal numbers in any country ; 
         <line/>and no doubt is entertained by us, or by any judicious observer, of its 
         <line/>salubrity. We have several wells of excellent water, and many more 
         <line/>are in progress. Our soil is fertile beyond my own expectation ; but 
         <line/>our exertions have hitherto been chiefly directed to the permanent 
         <line/>objects of building and fencing, of which much has already been 
         <line/>done. We have, however, collected a stock of hogs and cattle ; and 
         <line/>I think acres of corn are now growing than there are indivi<sh/>
         
         <column/>
         <line/>duals in the settlement."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"With regard to pecuniary success, the capitalist is commencing 
         <line/>his operations, or looking around him undecided as to the course he 
         <line/>shall pursue ; but the labourer has <i>made</i> an <i>establishment</i>. It is not 
         <line/>with him as with the capitalist, a state of hope merely, from good 
         <line/>prospects, but of enjoyment, from good possessions. Numbers of 
         <line/>this class, and of mechanics, have already realized their little free<sh/>
         
         <line/>holds, and are building cabins for themselves. The fruits of their 
         <line/>labour are not squandered in dissipation and excess, because they 
         <line/>have highr objects ; and, considering their former depressed condi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, it is astonishing to me, as it is honourable to them, that they be<sh/>
         
         <line/>try no arrogance in their to independence."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"In the statements I have published, I see little to correct, as far 
         <line/>as my observation and experience have now proceeded, excepting that, 
         <line/>in my view of the profits of cultivation to early settlers, I have not 
         <line/>made sufficient allowance in time for the innumerable delays and dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>appointments inseparable from new undertakings in a new country. 
         <line/>A year of preparatory and unproductive exertion should be added to 
         <line/>the debtor-side of the account at the outset."/&gt;

            <small_caps>Proceedings of the Court</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Lord Provost <small_caps>Manderston</small_caps> having been called to the Chair, the 
         <line/>Clerk, Mr A. Boswell, read a very distinct report of the results and 
         <line/>general features of the transactions at the Infirmary and Queensber<sh/>
         
         <line/>ry House Hospital for the last year. The Lord Provost then named 
         <line/>a Committee to examine the Treasurer's accounts, &amp;c., and report to 
         <line/>the adjourned meeting to be held in February next. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr John Witham</small_caps> junior then rose, and requested leave to submit 
         <line/>a few observations to the consideration of the Court. He stated in 
         <line/>substance that, though aware of its not being usual to vote thanks to 
         <line/>the Managers until their accounts have been examined, he was yet 
         <line/>anxious to embrace the first opportunity of expressing his conviction 
         <line/>that the exertions of the Managers had, at last, placed this valuable 
         <line/>Institution on a most desirable footing. Although he had not visited 
         <line/>the Hospital for the last twelve months, he had not ceased to take an 
         <line/>interest in its welfare ; and it was with great pleasure that he now 
         <line/>stated, that whether his inquiries were made of the medical attendants, 
         <line/>or of <i>recent patients,</i> the answers were uniformly satisfactory. The 
         <line/>Hospital was favoured with a good Matron, between whom and the 
         <column/>
         <line/>medical gentlemen the best understanding existed ; and the various 
         <line/>salutary regulations of the Managers have led to such a prosperous 
         <line/>state of things, as justly to entitle them to the gratitude of this Court 
         <line/>and the public. Still, however, he must say, that although the Hospi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tal was in a good state, yet, in his mind, Visitors could not fall to afford 
         <line/>that assistance to the Managers here, and that security against internal 
         <line/>abuses, which they had done in so many other similar institutions. It 
         <line/>was difficult to account for the prejudices which existed against this spe<sh/>
         
         <line/>cies of assistance in Edinburgh. At Leeds, in addition, to visitors of 
         <line/>our sex, there was a committee of ladies, who visisted the female wards, 
         <line/>and from the joint labours of both classes of visitors many and great 
         <line/>advantages had resulted. But in this city we had hospitals for fe<sh/>
         
         <line/>males, which are governed by men only, without seeking any help 
         <line/>from visitors of that sex, who are much better qualified to discharge 
         <line/>most of the duties. This view of these matters, he trusted, would yet 
         <line/>be attended to.–He must also crave the attention of the meet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to another matter, that of the L.11,700, for which the city of E<sh/>
         
         <line/>dinburgh pays only 4 1/2 per cent. He assured the Court, and its Ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>noured Chairman, that this subject was not introduced with the view 
         <line/>of touching upon, or insinuating any thing respecting the city's af<sh/>
         
         <line/>fairs. The money, he understood, was secured on the ale duty ; but 
         <line/>why should the Hospital lose one-half per cent, of interest? He had 
         <line/>once made a calculation, according to which the loss, from the be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ginning, had amounted to about L.10,000. It had been stated that 
         <line/>the Magistrates of Edinburgh had always been friendly to the Hos<sh/>
         
         <line/>pital ; but that was surely no reason for withholding L.59 of interest 
         <line/>that whatever former Magistrates had thought on the subejct the 
         <line/>present would not submit to the idea of depriving the Hospital of any 
         <line/>part of its lawful interest. If the ground on which the Hospital was 
         <line/>built was alluded to, it was plain that town had already got more, 
         <line/>by the reduced interest than its original value. The town of Edin<sh/>
         
         <line/>burgh had also got L.8273 ; 17 ; 3 of invalid money from Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, on condition of paying <i>the interest</i> to the Infirmary, <i>which inte-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>rest</i>, if paid at two terms in the years, should be restricted to 3 1/2 per 
         <line/>cent. And as the property tax–which the Town did not retain from 
         <line/>the Hospital, whether they did or did not pay it to Government,–is 
         <line/>now at an end, he could see no reason for withholding the usual rate 
         <line/>of interest. He concluded by suggesting the names of several gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>men as a Committee, to lend out the sum of L.11,700 on interest at 
         <line/>5 per cent, if the Magistrates of Edinburgh should decline to pay that 
         <line/>rate of interest. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr Alex. Cruishank</small_caps> seconded the motion 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Col. <small_caps>Crichton</small_caps> regretted that the respectable gentlemen
            should have 
         <line/>introduced such a motion. He seldom visisted the Infirmary, but 
         <line/>when he sent patients to it ; but he could state, that when his servants 
         <line/>or workmen have been there from fever, the attention they received 
         <line/>was in every respect equal to what he, and he hoped he was a respec<sh/>
         
         <line/>table citizen, could command in his own house. But he could men<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion the testimony of one whose authority was much higher than his 
         <line/>own – that of a medical gentlemen of some eminence in his profes<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion, who lives abroad, and who was recently in this country. That 
         <line/>professional gentleman spoke the very highest terms both of the 
         <line/>medical treatment and the economy of the House. It was matter 
         <line/>of pride, he said, to every Scotsman, to hear the manner in which the 
         <line/>Infirmary of Edinburgh was spoke of in all the quarters of the globe. 
         <line/>It was the pattern of all that was excellent in such institutions, and a 
         <line/>nursery of the most skilfull practitioners ; for go where we will, the 
         <line/>answer to almost every question put with respect to improved hospi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tal treatment is, that it was learned in the Infirmary of Edinburgh. 
         <line/>Whether, indeed, we thought of these things ; whether we looked at 
         <line/>the sublime inscriptions on the outside of the Hospital, and the Chris<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain doctrines and principles there inculcated or the treatement and 
         <line/>management within we could not fail to be struck with admiration 
         <line/>and without imputing any motives, which he was not entitled to do 
         <line/>he must say, it would be much more creditable to the respectable gen<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlemen if they should confine themselves to expressing their high o<sh/>
         
         <line/>pinion of the institution and tanking the Managers instead of oc<sh/>
         
         <line/>cupying the valuable time of this Honourable Court with quibbling 
         <line/>about trifles, which were every way contemptible. After a pause, 
         <line/>Col. Crichton made a counter motion, to get rid of Mr Wigham's. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Lord <small_caps>Meadowbank</small_caps> reminded the Court, that this matter of
            inte<sh/>
         
         <line/>rest had already been under the consideration of a Committee, and 
         <line/>decided on by the Court. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Henry Jardine</small_caps>, Esq. begged to mention a fact that the Town of 
         <line/>Edinburgh had contributed L.50 to the Infirmary for the last year. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Ritchie</small_caps> rose and said, that though perfectly aware of
            what the 
         <line/>result would be, he could not allow the matter to be settled without 
         <line/>giving Mr Wigham's motion his support. It gave him much pleasure 
         <line/>to find it was no longer unfashionable to allude to Christian doc<sh/>
         
         <line/>trines in such meetings as this,–a change from which he anticipated 
         <line/>much good. He concurred in what had been said on this subject by 
         <line/>the gentleman at the foot of the Table ; but he begged to remind him 
         <line/>that it was a great principle of Christianity, that nothing was too tri<sh/>
         
         <line/>fling to be attended to it it promised good; and the additional interest of 
         <line/>the money in question would obviously extend the means of <i>healing</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>the sick</i>, the great object of the Institution. Nothing, indeed, which 
         <line/>had fallen from that gentleman, or the Learned Lord on the other 
         <line/>side, could meet or touch the simple proposition, that <i>five per cent</i> is 
         <line/>the legal rate of interest, and that the Town of Edinburgh ought not 
         <line/>to pay less. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There was another subject alluded to by Mr Wigham, on which, if 
         <line/>Mr W. did not, he would submit a motion, namely, <i>Visitori</i> 'And 
         <line/>this he conceived was the fittest time for appointing them. All sides 
         <line/>of the house were, now agreed that the Hospital was admirably con<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducted. It was impossible, therefore, to suppose that the measure 
         <line/>was proposed from any distrust of the Managers. If the management 
         <line/>was perfect now, it was too much to expect it could continue so ; and 
         <line/>this was the proper time for providing against the future. In other 
         <line/>places the highest characters in the land had acted with visitors ; and 
         <line/>much benefit had been derived from them in England, and even at 
         <line/>Glasgow. If human nature, therefore, was not different in Edin<sh/>
         
         <line/>burgh from wht it is on the other side of the Tweed, and in the west 
         <line/>of Scotland, it must be admitted that Visitors would be beneficial 
         <line/>here also. Besides, as the Managers were aware of their strength, 
         <line/>and that no measure could be carried here without their consent, the 
         <line/>granting of Visitors would be a <i>boon</i> from themselves. He moved, 
         <line/>that this Court do annually name 24 or more Visitors to act month<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly by rotation, and minute such observations as shall occur to them 
         <line/>for the consideration of the Managers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Wigham</small_caps> seconded the motion ; but as the Court seemed
            averse 
         <line/>to entertain it, it was withdrawn. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Ritchie</small_caps> then said, that as his last motion was intended
            chiefly 
         <line/>as a caveat to the Committee named by the Lord Provost, he would 
         <line/>also, with the same view, state the nature of a motion which he wish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to submit, but the merits of which he was not then fully prepared 
         <line/>to state. it was one, however, of which he was sure it would not be 
         <line/>said, that it was introduced for the purpose of giving trouble, or un<sh/>
         
         <line/>necessarily occupying the time of the Court. Its object was the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>motion of medical science, and its nature would be understood by 
         <line/>his reading a single paragraph from the able Clinical Reports of Dr 
         <line/>Duncan junior. " Almost all hospitals (it is there stated,) publish 
         <line/>annual Reports; but in many cases they are intended only to fur<sh/>
         
         <line/>nish information as to the expenditure of the funds, and the names of 
         <line/>the office-bearers, and as a public acknowledgement of the support of 
         <line/>the subscribers. Such reports, however, are of no use in marking the 
         <line/>progress of disease, and, except for purposes mentioned above, do po<sh/>
         
         <line/>sitive harm, by causing hospital reports in general to be neglected as 
         <line/>utterly without value. This, however, is not the case ; and the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ports we have of late years received from the Fever Hospitals of 
         <line/>Dublin and Cork are worthy of being imitated by hospitals of every 
         <line/>kind and in every place. Indeed, the public have a right to expect this 
         <line/>information in return for their liberality in supporting them. We have 
         <column/>
         <line/>only to add, that the most valuable reports often proceed entirely from 
         <line/>the zeal of the reporters, and are only occasional. This leads 
         <line/>us to suggest, that the governors of hospitals should enjoin their regu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar as a duty upon their medical officers ; and we will 
         <line/>venture to say, that where it has not yet been practised, its good ef<sh/>
         
         <line/>fects upon the institution in an economical as well as professional 
         <line/>points of view, will soon be apparent."–His motion went to carry this 
         <line/>suggestion into effect ; and without farther preface he should now 
         <line/>read it. The substance of it was, that in addition to the Journal kept 
         <line/>at present, Digest of the whole should be kept in a <i>tabular form</i> but 
         <line/>especially of the date of admission, age, sex, and place of residence 
         <line/>of the patients ; date of commencement, crisis, termination and as<sh/>
         
         <line/>signed causes of their diseases ; with a diary of the temperatures and 
         <line/>moisture of the atmosphere, state of winds, prices of staple pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions &amp;c. ; with an annual medical report, taking notice of the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>crease or decrease of population, and of the employment, diet and ha<sh/>
         
         <line/>bits of the labouring classes, as far as practicable. Some of the mem<sh/>
         
         <line/>bers, he observed, seemed to be amused with this enumeration ; but 
         <line/>the medical gentlemen would be aware of what he pointed at. With 
         <line/>their peculiar and proper duties, he had no wish to interfere. They 
         <line/>knew them well, and discharged them faithfully and honourably. In 
         <line/>their practise they attended to every thing that was necessary ; but 
         <line/>their knowledge often died with him ; and his object was to preserve 
         <line/>the results of their skill and experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The <small_caps>Lord President</small_caps> said he hoped the gentlemen who had made 
         <line/>this motion, would see, on reflection, from the labour and time requi<sh/>
         
         <line/>site to carry it into effect, how very impracticable it would be in an 
         <line/>hospital like that of the Royal Infirmary, where the Managers had no 
         <line/>compulsory authority over the medical gentlemen, whose time was 
         <line/>so occupied with their own private avocations. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Proposer of the motion said, that instead answering what had 
         <line/>fallen from the Right Honourable Judge in his own language, he 
         <line/>would beg leave to read another passage from Dr Duncan's volu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble publication, and which, he hoped, would obviate some of the diffi<sh/>
         
         <line/>culties adverted to. " The trouble (says Dr Duncan,) of keeping 
         <line/>such tabular records, is not so great as might be supposed. It requires 
         <line/>only system and regularity; and when we see how easily it is done in 
         <line/>the military hospital, <i>we cannot help regretting that it is not also in-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>troduced general into civil hospitals.</i> If the practitioner himself has 
         <line/>not time to fill up the columns of the prescribed table, it would be 
         <line/>very little additional trouble to his clerk ; or if the time of that assis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tant would not easily permit him, <i>the duty would be very gladly taken</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>by another of the Hospital pupils.</i>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Dr <small_caps>Hope</small_caps>, in a neat and eloquent speech, opposed the motion.
            The 
         <line/>Managers, he said, were willing to give due consideration to every 
         <line/>proposal from whatever quarter it might come. The present, how<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever, he considered as impractiable. To prepare tabular records of 
         <line/>the nature suggested, required great experience, much comprehens<sh/>
         
         <line/>ion and many talents. It was a task which every one was not qua<sh/>
         
         <line/>lified to discharge in a mnner could be beneficial to the public, 
         <line/>and one which gentlemen, who lived by their profession, could not be 
         <line/>expected to undertake. The case was different in military hospitals, 
         <line/>where the medical getlmen could devote the whole of their time to 
         <line/>their hospital duties. But it should be know, that the materials for 
         <line/>making up such tables are all recorded in the infirmary Journals ; and 
         <line/>that these Journals are open to <i>all the medical attendants;</i> so that 
         <line/>whoever finds that he has time and talents for the performance of 
         <line/>such tasks, has the fullest opportunity for undertaking and complet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing them. Accordingly we had had the very able reports of Dr 
         <line/>Duncan, and the useful work of Dr Welsh. The Institution has now 
         <line/>the benefit of Dr Duncan's services ; and he considered it better to 
         <line/>leave the completion of such works and reports to the zeal and talents 
         <line/>of individuals. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The <i>Mover</i> then stated that he was perfectly aware of Dr. Welsh's 
         <line/>judicious publication as well as Dr Duncan's and he certainly would 
         <line/>never have introduced such a measure, had it not been suggested and 
         <line/>recommended by a much abler mind than his own. He had not un<sh/>
         
         <line/>dertaken the task from any idea that he was able to do it justice, or 
         <line/>that he could do it better, or even so well as many other members of 
         <line/>the Court ; but from the conviction, that if he had not introduced the 
         <line/>subject, it would be introduced at all. He had no wish, however 
         <line/>to give unnecessary trouble, and should, therefore, for the present, beg 
         <line/>leave to withdraw his motion.

         <line/>Our readers will learn with pleasure, that the Lord Advocate, 
         <line/>with a laudable anxiety for the honour of our criminal jurispru<sh/>
         
         <line/>dence, has announced officially, that the Clerk of Court "strikes the 
         <line/>Jury, by taking <i>45</i> after <i>45, until they served in rotation.</i>" They 
         <line/>consist of a " list of Jurymen furnished by the High Constables"/&gt;
         <line/>for Edinburgh and those "regularly required from the counties of 
         <line/>Linlithgow and Haddington," which names " were <i>then</i> put up<sh/>
         
         <line/>on a roll, which was put into the bands of the Clerk of Court;"– 
         <line/>the Jurors thus struck being cited, not by a Sheriff officer, but by 
         <line/>a Macer of the Justiciary ourt. We are not aware of any law 
         <line/>which requires the Clerk of Court to take the Jurors by rotation ; 
         <line/>but it reflects great credit on his judgement that he resorts to this 
         <line/>unequivocal mode of displaying his impartiality. This is a virtue 
         <line/>which the law requires in all its officers ; and it is fortunate when 
         <line/>such rules are devised and adhered to as make the virtue incon<sh/>
         
         <line/>trovertibly visible. At such an advanced stage of society, honour 
         <line/>and public opinion will secure impartial justice ; but still, when 
         <line/>the possibility of some retrograde movement is adverted to, it 
         <line/>would be a wise measure to convert what all functionaries do at 
         <line/>present from principle, into specific rules for directing the conduct 
         <line/>of their successors. The Lord Advocate, it has been reported, is 
         <line/>about to introduce into Parliament a Bill or Bills respecting the 
         <line/>Judicatories of Scotland ; and his Lordship, it is obvious, might 
         <line/>obtain a well-merited popularity by throwing in some clauses to 
         <line/>fix the qualifications of a Juror in the different counties of Scot<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, and to regulate the times and the manner in which lists of 
         <line/>Jurors are to be made up, reduced into a penl of 45, and then to 
         <line/>a jury of 15. Ther is, if we mistake not, a cerain discretion on 
         <line/>more than one of these points left with functionaries, who, we 
         <line/>doubt not, would most readily part with it. To them it would be 
         <line/>a relief ; and though the arraigned might sometimes have less im<sh/>
         
         <line/>partial juries than at present, yet, if the ballot were introduced 
         <line/>here, as it has recently been in civil cases, the impartiality would 
         <line/>be more coguisable, and placed beyond the reach of doubt and 
         <line/>misrepresentation. It would be no disgrace to Scotland to bor<sh/>
         
         <line/>row in this respect from her sister kingdom, but an honour which 
         <line/>France seems willing to do herself at present, and which we very 
         <line/>lately did ourselves in modelling our Jury Court.

         <line/>Mr Bywater has construced a small model of a ship in such 
         <line/>a manner as to exhibity, by actual experiment, the principal 
         <line/>magnetic phenomena mentioned by Captain Flinders, in his 
         <line/>voyage to New Holland. From a minute attention to the sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject, Mr B. has devised a plan, which, in all probability, will 
         <line/>remedy, by very simple means, the defect arising from the lo<sh/>
         
         <line/>cal attraction pointed out by Captain Flinders, and thus be of

         <line/>[?]. Lately the notes of Mr. Birkbeck have ex<sh/>

         <line/>[?] Birkbeck, accustomed to all the comforts, and, 
         <line/>[?], much of the elegance of life, plunges,

         <line/>Birkbeck[?], who was accustomed to go from one field 
         <line/>to another, admiring his crops and his cattle, and 
         <line/>thing to do but to give the servants their orders 
         <line/>the day, and saw all his works proceeding as ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] as he wished, now finds himself an insulated 
         <line/>[?], surrounded by a few miserable fiels, taken 
         <line/>[?] the bog, and full of musquetoes; his children 
         <line/>[?] sick from this unhealthy situation; and, in 
         <line/>[?] severe disease, beyond the reach of medical 
         <line/>assistance. It is possible to believe that, under such 
         <line/>circumstances, he does not regret the country he has 
         <line/>[?]. And let me not be told that the prospect of 
         <line/>[?]] his children a rich inheritance will turn the 
         <line/>[?] into sweet–he is not that sort of man; nor do 
         <line/>[?] any law of nature which urges a parent to 
         <line/>[?] his own happiness, in order to confer a doubt<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] upon his children. We allow that, after a 
         <line/>[?], he will be surrounded with neighbours; 
         <line/>[?] their society is not very agreeable; it is indeed 
         <line/>[?], as Mr Birkbeck himself admits. After 
         <line/>[?] his connexions, his country, all his early 
         <line/>[?] and pleasing recollections, his ease and 
         <line/>[?] what does he gain? Some landed property, 
         <line/>[?] he dies in improving, in an unhealthy situa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion[?]. He may not be able to leave a farm to each of his 
         <line/>children[?]; but of what use will they be if not culti<sh/>
         
         <line/>vated[?]? And he will discover in the bitterness of 
         <line/>[?], that this legacy is not equal to the placing 
         <line/>[?] upon a farm, though taken at a rack-rent. 
         <line/>[?] different the situation of a loyal farer, pos<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] of Mr. Birkbeck's substance, if he should 
         <line/>[?] this province[?]![?] He need not go ten miles from 
         <line/>[?] settlement, even if he went at once up<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] lands granted him by the crown. But, if he 
         <line/>[?] an improved farm, his privations will be 
         <line/>[?] compared to those which he must suffer in 
         <line/>[?] to the back settlements of the United States, as 
         <line/>[?] still more fully appear. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It should not, however, be forgotten, that, with 
         <line/>[?] possible advantage of soil, neighbourhood, 
         <line/>[?] climate, emigration to America, a country so 
         <line/>[?] from Great Britain, is a matter of deep and 
         <line/>[?] consideration. The persons emigrating 
         <line/>[?] civil in their property, break up all commerce, 
         <line/>[?], and connexions in the country they are leav<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] and if they find their expectations disappoint<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] the country of their choice, they are ashamed, 
         <line/>perhaps unable, to return. Emigrants often fail, 
         <line/>[?] they have never examined their subjects pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] and find, on trial, that they do not possess 
         <line/>qualities to insure success.–The habits, 
         <line/>knowledge, and accomodation of manners, 
         <line/>[?] this new life requires, are not, perhaps, na<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] to them–they have not the strength, the 
         <line/>[?] and perseverance, which their new situation 
         <line/>[?]. The emigrant is not prepared to meet the 
         <line/>difficulties[?] which the climate, new manner of living, 
         <line/>[?] or vermin, may bring upon him; and which, 
         <line/>[?] of all his exertions, may frequently destroy 
         <line/>[?]. It is, therefore, the greatest cruelty to 
         <line/>[?] the matter partially; and, while the advantages 
         <line/>[?] from the old to the new world are drawn 
         <line/>[?] most fascinating colours, to conceal the priva<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] and sacrifices which must be made, and the 
         <line/>[?] of failure which may be opposed to 
         <line/>of success. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We[?] shall have occasion to prove, by the most un<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] the evidence, that Upper Canada offers to emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] advantages, vastly superior to any portion of 
         <line/>[?] United States; but we would still admonish 
         <line/>[?] thinking to leave their native country, 
         <line/>[?] the matter with severe minuteness, not 
         <line/>[?] away by golden dreams; and to prepare 
         <line/>[?] should they decide upon going, to meet 
         <line/>[?] [?] from sickness, from different 
         <line/>[?], [?] labour, and privations of various 
         <line/>[?] Yet though no step can be so important as 
         <line/>[?] leaving one native's country for ever, it is to 
         <line/>[?] that such a step is taken without due con<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?]. The fancy is deluded with goldren dreams; 
         <line/>farmers[?] in America are owners of the soil on 
         <line/>[?] they live; they have no rents to pay, no tax<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] their doors; possessing a noble indepen<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] they acknowledge no superiority but genius 
         <line/>[?]. These are high sounding things, but 
         <line/>[?] than solid. Before a man allows him<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] deluded by them, he should remember, 
         <line/>[?] no great hardship to pay rent, if his pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] three times the price in England that it 
         <line/>[?] America; that the difficulty of bringing 
         <line/>[?] to maret, a tax, not perhaps inferior 
         <line/>[?] he had paid at home, and attended with 
         <line/>difficulties[?] which he never experience; that

         <line/>in removing from his native country, he is

         <line/>to learn in the midst of strangers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>When a man has, after mature deliberation, de<sh/>
         
         <line/>termined to emigrate, which various considerations 
         <line/>may, in particular cases, render prudent, his next 
         <line/>question is, Where shall he go–to the United States 
         <line/>or to Canada? We shall suppose the persons emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grating to be friends to the British constitution; for 
         <line/>if they are not, there is no question; because level<sh/>
         
         <line/>lers and democrats will find themselves in a bad 
         <line/>situation in coming to Canada, as they will find no 
         <line/>kindred spirits there. But though we can willing<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly spare such as these, to lose good subjects is a 
         <line/>serious evil to the empire; and to lose them through 
         <line/>ignorance, and the want of that information which 
         <line/>it is in our power to give, is a folly, as well as 
         <line/>all evil. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>I am persuaded, that all emigrants, of the descrip<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion we mention, would rather prefer to remain un<sh/>
         
         <line/>due their own government, than to live under and 
         <line/>swear allegiances to another, provided no greater 
         <line/>sacrifices were required in going to the one than to 
         <line/>the other. I am indeed quite certain, that many 
         <line/>would consent willing to a considerable sacrifice 
         <line/>for this advantage, so agreeable to their feelings and 
         <line/>habits; but we shall shew that no such sacrifice is 
         <line/>required, and that their interest, as well as inclina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, when duly considerd, will lead them to Upper 
         <line/>Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In going to the United States, we have Mr. Birk<sh/>
         
         <line/>beck's authority, that 'no good settlement can be 
         <line/>made cast of the Alleghany mountains, or in the 
         <line/>Atlantic States.' The lands are now so dear, as to 
         <line/>be in general, far beyond the reach of common 
         <line/>emigrants, who have seldom much left after landing 
         <line/>in America.

         <line/>instead of joining Mr. Birkbeck, even if he purchases 
         <line/>his lands at the same price, saves 928 dollars, which 
         <line/>will enable him to clear a large portion of his farm, 
         <line/>stock it, and build a comfortable house; and if he 
         <line/>be granted the land, instead of purchasing it, there

         <line/>Let us now see what the product at Mr. Birkbeck's

         <line/>command in the market; for, notwithstanding the

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From this table it is manifest, that the produce 
         <line/>raised in Upper Canada sells at an advance of up<sh/>
         
         <line/>wards of 30 per cent on what the same can be sold 
         <line/>in the Illinois territory, supposing Mr. Birkbeck's 
         <line/>prices correct, which they are not, being much too 
         <line/>high. The vast advantage, therefore, in coming to 
         <line/>Upper Canada, must appear manifest. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It may by some be said, that the families are too 
         <line/>numerous, as there are few that consist of ten per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons; but the results will be proportionally the same, 
         <line/>whatever the number be; and if we suppose them 
         <line/>to consist of persons in comfortable circumstances in 
         <line/>their own country, they will commonly bring ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vants with them, by which the average will be still 
         <line/>greater. But this is of no moment; the difference 
         <line/>of expense in travelling 500 miles, or 1570, is suf<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficiently clear. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We must add, to the disadvantage of Mr. Birk<sh/>
         
         <line/>beck's farmer, the dearness of all those articles which 
         <line/>he has to purchase; for his distance from the sea<sh/>
         
         <line/>coast and market operates in two ways to his disad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vantage. 'His produce is low, and the goods from 
         <line/>are dear: the shopkeeper, who is at a great 
         <line/>distance from the place where the articles he deals 
         <line/>in are procured, will add to the price, when he dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>poses of the, the additional expense of bringing, 
         <line/>and the time lost in procuring them. To him who 
         <line/>is obliged to take a journey of 1600 miles to procure 
         <line/>his articles of merchandize, the cost and trouble must 
         <line/>be very great; and all this he makes the consumer 
         <line/>pay. The journey which Mr. Birkbeck's merchant 
         <line/>is obliged to take is a very serious one, compared to 
         <line/>that of the merchant of York or Niagara. The lat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter, in consequence of this situation, can trade with 
         <line/>a smaller capital than the former; because he can 
         <line/>at any time procure a fresh supply in a few days, 
         <line/>while the former can lay in a stock of goods only 
         <line/>once a-year. Now, all these difficulties are to be 
         <line/>paid for by the farmers and mechanics, who con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sume the articles imported; the difference to them, 
         <line/>in the course of a twelvemonth, by receiving less for 
         <column/>
         <line/>the articles they sell, and paying more for those they 
         <line/>purchase will be found to be very great. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>'It is not merely the quantum he shall raise, but 
         <line/>the sun he shall get for it, which constitutes the 
         <line/>farmer's advantage. It is not simply to get enough 
         <line/>to eat and drink that is to bound the desires of the 
         <line/>farmer; it is to procure the means of converting his 
         <line/>log-cabin into a handsome and convenient house– 
         <line/>to erect a large barn for his grain, and suitable build<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings for his cattle–to educate his children–and, 
         <line/>as he grows old, to enjoy the satisfaction of finding 
         <line/>that his industry has supplied the comforts of life, 
         <line/>and enabled him to satisfy the wants of society– 
         <line/>wants to which we are indebted for amelioration 
         <line/>of mankind.' 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the selection of a place to residence in a new 
         <line/>country, it is very important to take into view the 
         <line/>ultimate market for the farmer's produce. While 
         <line/>the country is settling, there will be no difficulty; 
         <line/>for the increasing population will demand all the 
         <line/>supplies that can be raised. But the prudent set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tler will look beyond that period, and consider what 
         <line/>he shall do when every one raises more grain than 
         <line/>he will be able to consume. In that case, vicinity 
         <line/>to market, and facility of transportation, are all im<sh/>
         
         <line/>portant. Now, the produce of Upper Canada can 
         <line/>be sent to Montreal, one of the best markets in A<sh/>
         
         <line/>merica in five or six days, at a trifling expense, 
         <line/>which is yearly diminishing as the waters are im<sh/>
         
         <line/>proved. Very different is the case with the farmer 
         <line/>in the western division of the United States: the im<sh/>
         
         <line/>mense distance which grain has to be sent, occasions 
         <line/>the expense to be so great, as frequently to equal, and 
         <line/>sometimes exceed, the price offered when it reaches 
         <line/>the market. The more that this statement is exa<sh/>

         <line/>ther country on the shores of Southern Africa, 
         <line/>four vessels, containing above 600 souls, have 
         <line/>sailed from Liverpool, bound to the Cape of 
         <line/>Good Hope; three of them under the command 
         <line/>and direction of a naval officer, and one under 
         <line/>private superintendance. The public agent was

         <line/>Thursday afternoon, the brig Alexander 
         <line/>sailed from Greenock with emigrants for Prince 
         <line/>Edward's island. This vessel had 85 pas<sh/>

         <line/>Extract of a letter, dated in Perth, Upper 
         <line/>Canada, 18th January – "Liberty and Equality 
         <line/>are the predominant principles here. A common 
         <line/>labourer from Scotland is entitled to a lot of 
         <line/>land. Whenever he finds he can subsist upon 
         <line/>his farm, he becomes as high as the best in the 
         <line/>township. Every settler, though ever so poor, 
         <line/>has a vote for the member for the township, 
         <line/>and has full liberty to speak at every meeting. 
         <line/>– It is nothing uncommon to see a poor Glasgow 
         <line/>weaver, who came among us with scarce a stitch 
         <line/>to cover his nakedness, strutting between the 
         <line/>stumps of his trees as pompous as an Ediburgh 
         <line/>Magistrate."/&gt;

            <small_caps>here</small_caps> wasa time when it was held pure factiousness to 
         <line/>doubt whether the prosperity we enjoyed during the first ten 
         <line/>or twelve years of the late war, was perfectly sound and na<sh/>
         
         <line/>tural, and whether it would not ultimately entail upon us a 
         <line/>corresponding share of future calamity. But the most gloomy 
         <line/>anticipations of those who were most inclined to view the pic<sh/>
         
         <line/>ture on the dark side have certainly come infinitely short of 
         <line/>the full measure of distress and misery which have at length 
         <line/>fallen upon the country. It would be unjust to charge the 
         <line/>Government with any more of these evils than might have 
         <line/>been foreseen ; but now that they force themselves on the at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tention on all sides, it is perfectly fair to hold the Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment accountable for all that it can remove or prevent, and 
         <line/>yet suffers to exist. This is the first time, we believe, in mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>dern history, when the evil of an excess, of population has come 
         <line/>so distinctly under the notice of a Government as to call for 
         <line/>a legislative remedy. The case is therefore new, and the 
         <line/>course to be pursued is the less obvious ; but the war was a 
         <line/>season of bold experiments, in which we surmounted many 
         <line/>difficulties once deemed insuperable : and if timidity tie up our 
         <line/>hands now, when humanity calls upon us to move, the world 
         <line/>may well say, that the boasted energy of the Government has 
         <line/>been entirely reserved for the supply of its own wants out of 
         <line/>the pockets of the people, but that, when a period of public 
         <line/>calamity requiress exertions of a more painful kind, it is start<sh/>
         
         <line/>led by the smallest difficulty, and will not even make such 
         <line/>a slight effort as might evince its sympathy with the sufferers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>During the late war, the industry of the country was stimu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lated into a state of unprecedented activity, by the monopoly 
         <line/>we obtained of the commerce of the world–by thirty or forty 
         <line/>millions of the capital of the country being annually melted 
         <line/>down and consumed–and by the continual rise of prices pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duced by the depreciation of the currency. The great de<sh/>
         
         <line/>mand for labour, arising out of this state of things, with the 
         <line/>consequent increase of wages, caused a rapid augmentation in 
         <line/>the numbers of the people. In the ten years ending 1811, the 
         <line/>rate of increase in Britain was such as would have doubled the 
         <line/>population in fifty-two years; and in the great manufacturing 
         <line/>districts it probably equalled what takes place in a new colony. 
         <line/>When the peace came, and was followed by the destruction of 
         <line/>our commercial monopoly, the cessation of the annual loans, 
         <line/>and the diminuition of the paper issues, the sources of our fic<sh/>
         
         <line/>titious prosperity were dried up at once : a vast reduction took 
         <line/>place in the demand for labour ; profits and wages fell with 
         <line/>prices ; while the pressure of the taxes were doubled, and one<sh/>
         
         <line/> third added to their real amount by the rise in the value of 
         <line/>money. The laws, however, which regulate the multiplication 
         <line/>of human beings, cannot instantly bend to circumstances : a 
         <line/>long period necessarily elapses before the population accom<sh/>
         
         <line/>modates itself to the diminished demand for labour, and dur<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing this period the labouring classes must suffe extreme mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>sery. In this state we are at present, and time, from which 
         <line/>we hoped relief, has only aggravated the evil. There are but 
         <line/>three remedies upon which any dependence can be placed 
         <line/>– a reduction of taxation – a change in our commercial 
         <line/>system – and emigration. We have little hopes as to the first, 
         <line/>since this would require a sacrifice on the part of the Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of its own interest, real or supposed, which we see no 
         <line/>disposition to make. A relaxation in our restrictive commer<sh/>
         
         <line/>cial system has not the same obstacles to encounter, and we 
         <line/>have repeated shewn that it would be highly beneficial. The 
         <line/>reluctance of Ministers to attempt a change that may prejudice 
         <line/>the interest of some particular classes, might be considered as 
         <line/>a prudent caution, were it not observed, that when, instead of 
         <column/>
         <line/>relieving the distress of the people, the object is to suppy the 
         <line/>necessities of the Treasury, none of this caution appears, but 
         <line/>the complaints of the sufferers are disregarded as vulgar cla<sh/>
         
         <line/>mour. But the crisis is now such, that tenderness to the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terests of a few individuals may be cruelty to the public at 
         <line/>large. Though we shall preach free trade to other nations ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther with a bad grace, when we can no longer hold our mono<sh/>
         
         <line/>poly, it is so far well that our misfortunes are at last likely to 
         <line/>open our eyes to truths whch were familiar to philosophers 
         <line/>half a century ago. In our present circumstances, we may 
         <line/>perhaps almost be thankful, that a systematic error, which has 
         <line/>impeded our career, has kept this one resource open to us. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Emigration suggests itself so naturally as a remedy for a re<sh/>
         
         <line/>dundant population, that we are rather surprised there should 
         <line/>be much reluctance to have recourse to it. We need not 
         <line/>be afraid that the practise will continue longer than the ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>cessity which produces it. " The <i>vis intertiae</i> of people in ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral, says <small_caps>Malthus</small_caps>, and their attachment to their homes, 
         <line/>are qualities so strong and general, that we may rest assured 
         <line/>they will not emigrate, unless, from political discontents or ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>treme poverty, they are in such a state, <i>as will make it as much</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>for the advantages of their country as of themselves that they</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>should go out of it.</i>" We by no means underrate the difficul<sh/>
         
         <line/>ties that attend emigration upon a large scale, but these are 
         <line/>partly occasioned by the absurd practise of directing it exclu<sh/>
         
         <line/>sively to our own colonies. We have vast multitudes, whom 
         <line/>we can neither feed nor employ ; and surely the first and most 
         <line/>pressing object is to send them where they will find the means 
         <line/>of subsistence. There are many parts of the world besides our 
         <line/>own colonies open to receive them. And whether they go to 
         <line/>the United States, Brazil, Buenos Ayres, or to Canada, New 
         <line/>Holland, or the Cape of Good Hope, the advantage to this 
         <line/>country will be nearly the same. Among so many countries 
         <line/>of such extent, it would not be very difficult to dispose of half 
         <line/>a million of persons (young and old) within the course perhaps 
         <line/>of two years. But upon whatever scale emigration is conduct<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed it must be gradual; and this renders it the more important 
         <line/>to fix upon a plan early. Ministers have lately announced 
         <line/>that Canada cannot receive more emigrants at present with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out inconvenience. But had the intention of sending great 
         <line/>numbers to that colony been made public two years ago, corn 
         <line/>would have been raised for them, and men of some capital, 
         <line/>assured of finding abundance of labourers, would have gone 
         <line/>out and settled, and provided employment for those who have 
         <line/>not the means to establish themselves as farmers. The alarm 
         <line/>we feel of seeing manufactures raised up in other countries by 
         <line/>the skill of our expatriated artisans is very ill founded. Many 
         <line/>other advantges must be combined with the possession of 
         <line/>mechanical skill to make manufactures flourish ; and when the 
         <line/>former are found, able workmen will not be long wanting. Our 
         <line/>capital, our improved means of internal communication, our 
         <line/>coal fields, our laws for the protection of industry and proper<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty, the free, enlightened and active spirit of our people, with the 
         <line/>powers of combination resulting from the union of so many 
         <line/>advantages within so small a space, are better securities for 
         <line/>our superiority in manufactures, than attempts, which must be 
         <line/>nugatory, to retain a monopoly of operative skill and talent. 
         <line/>But the opinion which exists in foreign countries, as to the su<sh/>
         
         <line/>periority of our people in every branch of industry, will have 
         <line/>this good effect, that it will secure out emigrants a favourable 
         <line/>reception. Though the emigration, to afford any sensible re<sh/>
         
         <line/>lief to the whole country, would require to be upon an exten<sh/>
         
         <line/>sive scale, it is yet obvious, that even upon the smallest scale 
         <line/>it is beneficial. If six labourers are withdrawn from a small 
         <line/>village, or fifty from a country town, the situation of either 
         <line/>will be improved. The plan hitherto acted on by Government 
         <line/>of givingassistance to those only who could raise ten on fif<sh/>
         
         <line/>teen pounds, is chiefly objectionable, because it must restrict 
         <line/>the emigration within very narrow limits. If by sending away 
         <line/>men who are still able to subsist by their labour, others now 
         <line/>living on charity get employment, we are in effect relieved of 
         <line/>so many paupers. But the former are less disposed to leave 
         <column/>
         <line/>the country ; and with regard to those who are or must soon 
         <line/>become paupers, it will certainly be found more economical to 
         <line/>pay ten or fiften pounds each to send them abroad, than to 
         <line/>maintain them permanently home. It is in vain, however, 
         <line/>to look to private charity for the funds necessary for such an 
         <line/>undertaking. These must be raised by the country at large ; 
         <line/>and whether a tax be imposed for the special purpose, or mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ney destined for other objects be applied to this, the country, 
         <line/>we have no doubt, is ready to make the sacrifice. Suppose that 
         <line/>even so great a sum as five millions were required, this is but 
         <line/>the half of what England alone pays every year for poor rates ; 
         <line/>and what is such a sum, if it were to afford certain relief on 
         <line/>an emergency lke the present? If the French and Dutch should 
         <line/>again disagree about the navigation of the Scheldt, or if we should 
         <line/>quarrel with the French or Americans about the traffic in a few 
         <line/>hundred wild cat-skins on the other side of the globe, how 
         <line/>easily would a sum ten times as large be found? Nothing 
         <line/>more is requisite than to take on half of the sum for two 
         <line/>years, which Mr <small_caps>Vansittart</small_caps> allots for paying off the
            nation<sh/>
         
         <line/>al debt. We not only conceive that it would be wise and 
         <line/>creditable to divert a part, or the whole of the actual Sinking 
         <line/>Fund to this purpose ; but we go so far as to think, that it is lit<sh/>
         
         <line/>tle less than disgraceful to pay off any debt at all at this crisis 
         <line/>with funds wrung from the earnings of a starving population. 
         <line/>Whatever is done, it is of vast importance to understand, that 
         <line/>the most pressing evil, though not absolutely permanent in its 
         <line/>nature, cannot be expected to subside of itself for many years. 
         <line/>We have not only an excess of population to dispose of, but 
         <line/>we have to check the principle of increase, which is rapidly 
         <line/>aggravating the evil. In the five years ending 1810, the po<sh/>
         
         <line/>pulation of England added one-seventieth part to its numbers 
         <line/>annually ; and if we suppose the ratio to have been the same 
         <line/>for the whole empire, each year must have had 250,000 indi<sh/>
         
         <line/>viduals more to provide for than the preceding. Till the 
         <line/>whole of this vast annual inrease is got rid of, the present 
         <line/>excess of numbers will not diminish but augment. And how 
         <line/>is it to be got rid of? Either the annual births must diminish 
         <line/>more than one-third, or famine and disease must destroy a 
         <line/>quarter of a million of human beings annually beyond the u<sh/>
         
         <line/>sual rate of mortality, or these two causes must operate toge<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther. Notwithstanding, therefore, the misery of the labouring 
         <line/>classes at this moment, we doubt whether the population is 
         <line/>not still on the increase, and whether still more afflicting 
         <line/>scenes are not awaiting us. Indeed, unless measures are taken 
         <line/>to do away the factitious stimulus which the English poor<sh/>
         
         <line/> laws give to the increase of population, the most abundant e<sh/>
         
         <line/>migration will prove but a feeble palliative. These are rather 
         <line/>discouraging circumstances ; but the evil must be dealt with in 
         <line/>some way, or it will ultimately overwhelm us. It has now be<sh/>
         
         <line/>come rather a question of humanitiy than of policy. One or 
         <line/>two millions of human beings have been suddenly deprived of 
         <line/>their means of subsistence by events over which they had no 
         <line/>control. With such a mass of individuals goaded to despera<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion by want–a deficient crop,–a sudden revulsion in trade– 
         <line/>a more general exclusion of our manufactures by the Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>cans,–any of those numerous casualties, in short to which e<sh/>
         
         <line/>very nation is exposed, would place us in a situation frightful 
         <line/>to contemplate. Plots and insurrections will keep up a con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tinual alarm. Neither persons nor property will be safe, and 
         <line/>capital will gradually leave the country. If theory were silent, 
         <line/>experience must now convince us, that time alone will produce 
         <line/>no material amelioration in our circumstances ; and the relief 
         <line/>which is may ultimately bring, will be obtained only through 
         <line/>the destruction of vast multitudes by famine and disease. In 
         <line/>the fifth year of peace, it is now time to look the evil in the 
         <line/>face, and either to make some great sacrifices for its removal, 
         <line/>or to brace our minds to bear the dreadful alternative. It is 
         <line/>in vain to disguise the matter to our own consciences. Those 
         <line/>who propose to leave things to what they call the course of 
         <line/>nature, are in substance recommending that thousands of their 
         <line/>fellow-creatures should be suffered to rot away from the effect 
         <line/>of absolute want. That such a thing should take place in the

         <line/>Extract of a letter received from Calcutta, dated 
         <line/>22d November, 1819:--"An afflicting circumstance 
         <line/>has recently taken place. The Captain of the Bengal, 
         <line/>a Liverpool trader, very lately gave a ball on board 
         <line/>his ship, which was about to sail for England. The 
         <line/>party was very small, and more than half were taken 
         <line/>ill with a violent fever immediately afterwards. I 
         <line/>buried the Captain and the Surgeon a few days after 
         <line/>it; not less than ten of the part died within as many 
         <line/>days, all younger persons. Only one officer survives 
         <line/>of those who left England in the ship, and he is just 
         <line/>recovering in the Hospital. All sorts of conjectures 
         <line/>were made, but it turns out that there were 17,000 
         <line/>undressed buffalo horns in the hold, in a complete 
         <line/>state of putrefaction. This vessel has sailed for Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>land in this state without a Surgeon. I question 
         <line/>whether it will ever arrive; it ought not to be ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted among other shipping if it does;–the opening 
         <line/>of the hold will be death to him who does it, and per<sh/>
         
         <line/>haps to many more."--In consequence of this disas<sh/>
         
         <line/>trous information, Ministers have issued an order for 
         <line/>the vessel, on her arrival at Liverpool, or any other 
         <line/>part, to undergo quarantine.–<i>London Paper.</i>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>All apprehension on the above subject is complete<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly done away by the following letter from Liverpool, 
         <line/>May 14:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I noticed a paragraph in the London papers, 
         <line/>respecting the Bengal, of this port, at Calcutta, stat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing that a number of deaths had taken place, sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed in consequence of the Infectious vapours arising 
         <line/>from some buffalo horns.–The Bengal arrived here 
         <line/>April 5, and has been discharged without any of 
         <line/>those dreadful consequences which the medical gen<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlemen of Calcutta prognosticated.–I should rather 
         <line/>suppose that the fatal consequences which ensued 
         <line/>to those individuals who attended the ball given on 
         <line/>board this vessel at Calcutta, would be none justly 
         <line/>attributed to the exposure to night air."/&gt;

         <line/>dated 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Halifax, May 22 
         <line/>"At two o'clock this day the Earl of Dal<sh/>
         
         <line/>housie, Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief 
         <line/>of British North America, attended by the Ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>miral, his Majesty's Council, the staff, naval and 
         <line/>military officers, and the principal people of the 
         <line/>place, attended to lay the first stone of a new 
         <line/>college, to be erected at the north end of the 
         <line/>grand parade. The whole of the freemasons of 
         <line/>Halifax went in grand procession. They formed 
         <line/>in lodges at their hall, and, preceded by a military 
         <line/>band, and followed by another, they marched to 
         <line/>the places prepared for them on the building. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"His Lordship came on the scaffolding at 
         <line/>two o'clock, the grenadiers of the 62d regiment 
         <line/>being his guard of honour. Detachments from 
         <line/>each regiment kept the ground. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"After a prayer by the Rev. Mr Twining, 
         <line/>Grand Chaplain, Lord Dalhousie addressed the 
         <line/>assembly in a speech, of which I have not time 
         <line/>to give an outline ; but in it his Lordship men<sh/>
         
         <line/>tioned, that the building was intendeed as a college 
         <line/>upon the plan of that of Edinburgh, where all 
         <line/>students who professed the Christian religion 
         <line/>were eligible for admittance. Strangers residing 
         <line/>here for a short time might also enjoy the bene<sh/>
         
         <line/>fit of the institution, and gentlemen in the army, 
         <line/>the navy, and the military establishments. His 
         <line/>Lordship concluded a most eloquent and ani<sh/>
         
         <line/>mated address with his fervent wishes for the 
         <line/>welfare and prosperity of the undertaking. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A bottle with coins, and a tin case with 
         <line/>parchments, &amp;c. were then severally deposited in 
         <line/>the recess made for them, and the stone was 
         <line/>lowered into its place with all the requisite and 
         <line/>due forms, under a royal salute from fort Char<sh/>
         
         <line/>lotte ; after which the Rev. the Grand Chaplain 
         <line/>closed the proceedings with a prayer, and the 
         <line/>whole assembled multitude gave nine cheers.– 
         <line/>The military and masonic processions then re<sh/>
         
         <line/>turned in the same order, in which they came. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The day was beautiful, and a greater as<sh/>
         
         <line/>semblage of people was never witnessed in Hali<sh/>
         
         <line/>fax.

      <p>
         <line/>"The Countess of Dalhousie and her two sons, 
         <line/>Mrs Admiral Griffith and the Misses Wilson, and 
         <line/>most of the fashionable ladies here witnessed the

            <small_caps>Will of the Late Duke of Queensberry</small_caps>
         
         <line/>Mr Head stated, that he had to present a petition from 
         <line/>the annuitants and legates of the late Duke of Queens<sh/>
         
         <line/>berry, praying that a fourth more of their claims might be 
         <line/>paid, there now being sufficient funds in the hands of the 
         <line/>Accountant-General for that purposes. The Learned Coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>sel said, that there was no less a sum than L.1,400,000 
         <line/>accumulated and vested in the name of this officer, in 
         <line/>Bank stock, for the benefit of the claimants, and he un<sh/>
         
         <line/>derstood it was not intended to oppose the application, al<sh/>
         
         <line/>though the executors did not say they would give their 
         <line/>consent to it. Some consultation had been had on the 
         <line/>subject out of doors ; he therefore prayed that the prayer 
         <line/>of the petition should be granted. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Attorney-General said, he had not received any in<sh/>
         
         <line/>structions, nor had he been consulted. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The several King's counsel in Court spoke in behalf of 
         <line/>their respective clients. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Wingfield appeared for the Earl of Yarmouth, and 
         <line/>said his Lordship was anxious that the business should be 
         <line/>put in a train of settlement. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Lord Chancellor said, there was not a man existing 
         <line/>that had a heart in him but must wish the legacies and 
         <line/>annuities to be paid ; but, said his Lordship, the Marquis 
         <line/>of Queensberry has commenced an action for the recovery 
         <line/>of L.150,000 against the executor, and he certainly had a 
         <line/>right so to do it ; it was, therefore, proper that the Court 
         <line/>should see that no harm arose to the executors, before the 
         <line/>funds were allowed to go out of Court. With respect to 
         <line/>their not opposing the petition, that was very different to 
         <line/>consenting to it ; it merely said to the Court, " Mind you 
         <line/>do right."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Heald said, if his Lordship thought that one-fourth 
         <line/>was too much, they would take an eight, or any part his 
         <line/>Lordship pleased. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Lord Chancellor.–I will order it to stand first on 
         <line/>the paper for Tuesday next, and in the mean time I will 
         <line/>look over the petition.

      <p>
         <line/>We have great pleasure in publishing the following 
         <line/>interesting letter from India: – 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Madras, Feb. 4, 1820. 
         <line/>"I have, thank God, no very brilliant events to 
         <line/>communicate to you, but if the happiness of man is the 
         <line/>legitimate object of all Government, it is good to learn 
         <line/>that British India is at peace, and that a temperate 
         <line/>and radical reform is gradually going on under the 
         <line/>Marquess of Hastings' administration. The establish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of schools, and a free press, are the moving prin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciples by which this great advancement in the state of 
         <line/>society will be accomplished, unless checked by im<sh/>
         
         <line/>pious powers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"On the subject of these schools, it is not necessary 
         <line/>here to dilate. Suffice it to observe, that it is in the 
         <line/>power of any Government, abitrary or free, to educate 
         <line/>the great bulk of its subjects, and thereby to advance 
         <line/>them in knowledge, civilization, and happiness, in <i>the</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>shortest</i> possible period. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The establishment of a <i>free press in Asia</i> is, in my 
         <line/>estimation, as useful and magnanimous an art as ever 
         <line/>adorned the biography of any Statesman. What, say 
         <line/>its detractors, is setting loose a parcel of printer's devils 
         <line/>so great an act? No, but setting loose all the intel<sh/>
         
         <line/>ligence of the age to work upon the public mind and 
         <line/>conduct, is an act of unrivalled benevolence. Be it 
         <line/>asserted that a free press is only applicable to an ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vanced state of society, I deny the position ; it is not 
         <line/>founded in reason or experience. I contend on the 
         <line/>other hand, that where least knowledge and msot evil 
         <line/>exist, there is the greatest scope for improvement ; and 
         <line/>I offer Scotland as a proof of the efficacy[?] of education 
         <line/>and a free press. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The Marquess of Hastings, Governor General of 
         <line/>India, has, in the newspapers of Madras and Calcutta, 
         <line/>been accused of having sent two persons of the name of 
         <line/>Hastings, to <i>unhealthy</i> climates, the one to the East 
         <line/>and the other to the West Indies, where they <i>died ;</i>
         
         <line/>and for the <i>base</i> purpose of securing to his family the 
         <line/>title of Huntingdon. This, you must be aware, was 
         <line/>touching his sensitive honour to the quick ; and it 
         <line/>would seem as if some one inimical to a free press, had 
         <line/>introduced the paragraph to irritate him. But this 
         <line/>virtuous man, who would not tread on an insect, al<sh/>
         
         <line/>lowed this shameful slander to pass unnoticed. It stood 
         <line/>refuted in every bosom, and his manly forbearance 
         <line/>tended but to give further proofs of his attachment to 
         <line/>our infant liberty. Attacks have likewise been made 
         <line/>on Sir E. East, our Chief Justice. He complained, 
         <line/>they say, of these alleged libels to the Chief Magistrate, 
         <line/>
            <i>who desired him to have recourse to the law</i> Conceive 
         <line/>not, however, that I am the advocate for a licentious 
         <line/>press. My maxim is, that a great power, when mis<sh/>
         
         <line/>chievously applied, must be hurtful, and when well 
         <line/>applied, beneficial, in proportion to its strength. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"You will rejoice to learn that Mr Elphinstone, 
         <line/>Governor of Bombay, has done away with the Censor<sh/>
         
         <line/>ship of the Press. This wise Statesman, being a friend 
         <line/>to freedom, and having <i>experienced</i> the benefits which 
         <line/>had arisen in Bengal from the measure (for scarce a 
         <line/>day no passes that some abuse is not brought to light 
         <line/>by the press), adopted it the moment he came into 
         <line/>power, and thus proved himself a public benefactor. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"To conclude, it is my firm conviction, that the 
         <line/>diffusion of knowledge, through the medium of educa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion and a free press, will more than any other mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sure accelerate the improvement and heighten the pros<sh/>

         <line/>A new island has been discovered off Cape Horn, 
         <line/>in inst. 61 deg. long. 55 deg. by the ship William, on a 
         <line/>voyage from Monte Video for Valparaiso. The same

         <line/>dromache frigate, to survey the coast, had explored it 
         <line/>for 200 miles. The captain went ashore found it 
         <line/>covered with snow, and uninhabited. Abundance 
         <line/>of seals an whales were found in its neighbourhood. 
         <line/>He has named the island New Shetland.

         <line/>Accounts have beenreceived from Buenos Ayres, 
         <line/>by the Blossom sloop of War, of a curious nature.– 
         <line/>They relate to a project said to have been in agitation for 
         <line/>placing a Prince of the House of Bourbon at the head 
         <line/>of an independent Sovereignty on the River Plate.– 
         <line/>The circumstance has been brought to light by the late 
         <line/>changes in the Government of Buenos Ayres. From 
         <line/>the documents now published, and received by the 
         <line/>Blossom, it appears that in June, 1819. Gomez the 
         <line/>Envoy from Buenos Ayres, at Paris, was invited to a 
         <line/>conference by M. De Cazes, then French Minister for 
         <line/>Foreign Affairs, the object of which was to communi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cate a project of the French Cabinet for the colonsolida<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of the Independent Government of South Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>rica. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This project, the French Minister observed, would 
         <line/>meet with the decided approbation of the Continental 
         <line/>Powers, especially Russia and Austria. Great Britain 
         <line/>might not like it, but yet would not find any good pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>tence for resisting it ; and his Catholic Majesty would 
         <line/>yield to the influence of all Europe with the better 
         <line/>grace, as his former dependencies would be only trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferred to a branch of his own family. The King of 
         <line/>France would furnish assistance of every king, and em<sh/>
         
         <line/>ploy every means, even to the supply of troops, for car<sh/>
         
         <line/>rying the affair into execution. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 26th of October last, when the statement of 
         <line/>his conference reached Buenos Ayres, Rondeau, then 
         <line/>Director <i>ad interim</i> made a secret communication to 
         <line/>the Congress, and transmitted to them the letter of the 
         <line/>Envoy, together with the French memorial ; on the 
         <line/>following day, and on the 3d of November, the matter 
         <line/>was discussed in secret meetings, and the result was an[?] 
         <line/>opinion, that the Constitution lately-sworn allowed 
         <line/>no alteration to be made in the form of Government 
         <line/>till after the meeting of the Chambers. That a branch 
         <line/>of the Bourbon family, so closely connected with the 
         <line/>reigning Monarch of Spain, was in itself an insuperable 
         <line/>objection, as also the consideration that the Prince 
         <line/>proposed and supported by the Powers of the Euro<sh/>
         
         <line/>pean Continent, would naturally more incline towards 
         <line/>the views of his protectors than towards those of South 
         <line/>America, which ought to avoid all connexion with Eu<sh/>
         
         <line/>ropean continental politics ; and that Great Britain was 
         <line/>the power from which South America had most to 
         <line/>fear, and most to expect. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It was at the same time suggested, that the Envoys in 
         <line/>Europe shoud put the communications from Paris in<sh/>
         
         <line/>to the hands of the British Minstry, whose good opi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nion and protection South America is most anxious to 
         <line/>conciliate. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our Cabinet has always treated the South Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>cans with the greatest reserve, as if feating contamina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion by simple contact–a delicacy towards Spanish in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terests and feelings which appears in itself commenda<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble, but, when measured by the standard of national 
         <line/>benefit, may not merit the same praise. As it is, it 
         <line/>would seem that the British interest is likely to gain 
         <line/>the ascendacy in the river Plate, rather through the 
         <line/>disposition of the inhabitants, than from any influence 
         <line/>exerted by our Ministers. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We shall only add, that thought the negotiation was 
         <line/>carried on by the Duke de Cazes, the project did not 
         <line/>originate with him, and did not at first apply to the 
         <line/>Prince de Lucca. It was intended as an opening for 
         <line/>one more nearly allied to the reigning family in 
         <line/>France.

         <line/>still disposed to look to the United Statesm, as the abode 
         <line/>of independence and the source of affluence. Here we 
         <line/>see nearly 2000 British subjects, who, in one season, 
         <line/>through the agency alone of one of our Consuls(with<sh/>
         
         <line/>outany pecuniary aid), have removed from the United

         <line/>who have emigration in view, at once to Upper Cana<sh/>

         <line/>known, but truly fertile regions ; and we are informed 
         <line/>from a most authentic and satisfactory source, that there 
         <line/>there are unlocated lands, fertile beyond the conception of 
         <line/>those who have not seen them, capable of receiving ten 
         <line/>millions of inhabitants ; that the winters are not so 
         <line/>cold, nor the summers so hot, as in the State of New 
         <line/>York ; that these regions have proved eminently healthy 
         <line/>to the vast numbers that have poured into them of late 
         <line/>years ; and that the administration of the laws, the 
         <line/>state of education and religious instruction, and above

         <line/>"An opportunity having offered for transmitting 
         <line/>a hasty account of the Aurora and Brilliant transports, 
         <line/>proceeding with settlers to the Cape of Good Hope, I 
         <line/>feel happy in availing myself of that circumstance, 
         <line/>with a view as well to gratify our friends in England, 
         <line/>as to add another confirmation of the liberality of Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment in our important undertaking. First, it will 
         <line/>be necessary to state, that the two ships sail in compa<sh/>
         
         <line/>ny, and are every day within hail of each other ; the 
         <line/>former commanded by Captain Pearson, and the latter 
         <line/>by Captain Bothwell, who is accompanied by Lieute<sh/>
         
         <line/>nant Pritchard, as agent to both vessels. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"We sailed from Gravesend on. Our 
         <line/>course down Channel was most favourable, and the 
         <line/>weather has hitherto been propitious. No death, 
         <line/>disease, or serious accident has occurred in either ship 
         <line/>and blooming health and vigour now rapidly succeed the 
         <line/>langour produced by a sudden transition to a new ele<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. Provisions, consisting of flour, currants, suet[?] 
         <line/>oatmeal, peas, butter, cheese, tea, sugar, biscuit, salt 
         <line/>pork, and beef, of excellent quality, are liberally sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>plied, together with a proper allowance of rum, vine<sh/>
         
         <line/>gar, mustard and spices. The ships are fitted up in 
         <line/>every respect comfortably and commodiously, and the 
         <line/>most perfect harmony prevails, if we except bickerings 
         <line/>amongst the old women about fractured teapots and 
         <line/>mislaid culinary articles. The attention paid to the 
         <line/>comfort of the passengers, and more especially to that 
         <line/>of the women and children, by the Captains, and the 
         <line/>agent (Mr Pritchard), is highly creditable to the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>structions received from Government. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Although I do not sail in the same ship Cap<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain Bothwell. I have had ample proofs of the kind<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness and humane liberality which he shews to the pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sengers in the Brilliant. Captain Pearson is an active, 
         <line/>intelligent officer, who has been 23 years in the Tran<sh/>
         
         <line/>sport Service under Government : he has sailed to al<sh/>
         
         <line/>most every part of the world, and Algoa Bay, our 
         <line/>place of destination, is quite familiar to him. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"It may be egotism to speak of myself; but I trust 
         <line/>I may be excused in boasting, that of the crew and 
         <line/>240 passengers, not one is seriously indisposed at present, 
         <line/>and wishing, with heartfelt sincerity, to my friends in 
         <line/>England, happiness, peace, and tranquility, in as good 
         <line/>health as I now enjoy, long may they live, long live the

         <line/>by the ties of mutual friendship–the one affording her 
         <line/>parental arms, and the other mindful of her filial duty.

         <line/>We have received letters and papers, from the Cape 
         <line/>of Good Hope, to the 22d October, and they are sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tisfactory in all points of view, but especially with re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ference to the new settlement at Algoa Bay. His 
         <line/>Excellency, the Governor, Sir R. S. Donkin, was 
         <line/>taking some effectual measures to place the coinage 
         <line/>of the colony upon a better footing, and on the 13th 
         <line/>of October he issued a Proclamation for destroying a 
         <line/>very large quantity of base money. He has also taken 
         <line/>measure to communicate to the new settlers from 
         <line/>England the full benefit ofthe Courts of Justice es<sh/>
         
         <line/>blished in that quarter of the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We have received an account of the loss of the A<sh/>
         
         <line/>beona[?] transport, bound to the Cape of Good Hope, 
         <line/>with settlers. The following is an extract of a letter 
         <line/>from the Agent to Lloyd's, dated Lisbon, 20th Dec. 
         <line/>"The Condessa da Ponte, which arrived on the 20th 
         <line/>inst. from Marenham[?], has brought 49 persons, who 
         <line/>escaped from the Abeona transport, bound to the Cape 
         <line/>of Good Hope, which took fire and was burnt on the 
         <line/>25th ult. in lat. 5 N. long–and 113 lives were lost. 
         <line/>The Agent, Lieut. Madge, the Captain, Surgeon, 21 
         <line/>men, 16 boys, 4 women, and 5 girls, got into three 
         <line/>boats, and fortunately fell in with the Condessa da 
         <line/>Ponte, the morning after the fatal event."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Demerara Gazettes to a late date have been received, 
         <line/>which give detailed accounts of the number and state 
         <line/>of the slaves in that part of the West Indies. The re<sh/>
         
         <line/>port is given by James Robertson, Esq. the new Slave 
         <line/>Registrat of the United Colony. It is a triennial 
         <line/>statement of the slave population, and the Reporter 
         <line/>makes some judicious comparative remarks. It ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pears that there has been a large decrease of the num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber by deaths, but the Creoles are greatly increased as 
         <line/>compared with the former year. Births have been in 
         <line/>the proportion of one to forty-six. The Report de<sh/>
         
         <line/>fends the [?] of the West India Planters, and ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>serves that the state of the Black population serves[?] 
         <line/>to evil for little or no [?] ; so great is the 
         <line/>kindness, the liberality, and induglent care of pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>piertors. It adds, that their own interests is a perpe<sh/>
         
         <line/>tual[?] evil[?] upon their humanity. In the colony there

         <line/>[?] [?] [?] 
         <line/>slaves on the island, [?] Africans[?] and Creoles 
         <line/>and there are 38,910 female slaves of the same dono<sh/>
         
         <line/>mination, making a total of 76,929. The slave po<sh/>
         
         <line/>pulation in 1817, amounted in the whole to 77,867.– 
         <line/>The number of births which have occurred since that 
         <line/>period is 5,317, and deaths 7,140. The Report con<sh/>

         <line/>flourishing state of the colony.

            <i>Success of the Cutch Expedition against the Sindeans</i>
         
         <line/>–The following extract of a letter from Bombay 
         <line/>bringing this intelligence, we copy from Carrick's 
         <line/>Post, which appears to have exclusive means of obtain<sh/>

         <line/>"Bombay, Sept. 12, 1820. 
         <line/>"While I was seeing the last of your goods on 
         <line/>board, last night, a vessel arrived in the harbour hav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing on board an officer from Cutch, who was the hear<sh/>
         
         <line/>er of the official intelligence of the complete success 
         <line/>of Sir Charles Culville's expedition against the Sin<sh/>
         
         <line/>deans. The expedition consisted of 12,000 men, 
         <line/>commanded by his Excellency the Commander in 
         <line/>Chief ; from all I could clean of intellience from the 
         <line/>followers, it appeared there had been some hard fight<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing for five days ; but it ended, as might be anticipat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, from the imposing force sent against the Sindeans. 
         <line/>The moment the officer (who is one of the Staff, and 
         <line/>an Irishman) landed, he set out for the Government 
         <line/>House, to inform Lady Colville of the event, as it 
         <line/>must be supposed she was in a state og anxiety, her 
         <line/>husband being the commander, and her brother, and 
         <line/>her uncle, Colonel T. Blair, being also on the expe<sh/>
         
         <line/>dition. At day-light this morning orders arrived from 
         <line/>the Government House, to secure a passage and pri<sh/>
         
         <line/>vate cabin for the officer in th ship which takes this 
         <line/>to England, but there was no such accomodation, as 
         <line/>the cabins were all full ; and as another vessel will not 
         <line/>sail from thence about ten days, this and will be off 
         <line/>to-day, the chance is, you will have this letter at least 
         <line/>six weeks before the officers can reach England with 
         <line/>the official intelligence. All kinds of European pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duce are a drug hee, paricularly fine goods ; and 
         <line/>rum, brandy, and geneva, are for a song. The cho<sh/>
         
         <line/>lera has rather abated, but still rages in a frightful 
         <line/>manner."/&gt;

         <line/>The Rio Janeiro packet arrived on Tuesday with let<sh/>
         
         <line/>ters to the 21st of November. Advices had been re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceived from Rio Grande, stating that Artigas had been 
         <line/>taken prisoner. The Portuguese frigate, Union, had 
         <line/>captured two insurgent privateers which had been com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitting depredations on the coast. The events in Por<sh/>

         <line/>taken place in Portugal, the prices of produce had ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>perienced very trifling alteration, though, if the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>trary should be the case, a considerable rise was anti<sh/>

      <p>
         <line/>Extract of a letter from Rio Janeiro, dated Novem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber 20 :–" The Chilians have at length carried into 
         <line/>effect their boasted expedition, which left Valparaiso 
         <line/>on the 21st August, and arrived at Pisco at the begin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ning of September. San Martin landed 4,500 men, 
         <line/>but the blacks, cattle, &amp;c. had all been previously sent 
         <line/>away from the estates in that quarter, so that they will 
         <line/>be disappointed in meeting with partisans ; indeed the 
         <line/>slaves and lower orders, whom they expected to find 
         <line/>favourable to their views, are the most irritated against 
         <line/>the insurgents. We have letters from Lima to the 12th 
         <line/>September, which speaks of the little apprehensions en<sh/>
         
         <line/>tertained of San Martin and his troops, the Viceroy 
         <line/>having a formidable force, in the capital and vicinity, 
         <line/>of 8,000 men, commanded by good officers. The 
         <line/>Viceroy, is Commander-in-Chief, La Serna, second, 
         <line/>and La Mar and O'Reilly command divisions. They 
         <line/>were observin San Martin's movements who already 
         <line/>experienced the difficulties of subsisting his men. The 
         <line/>Marquis of Vallembrozo was on his flank, with a 
         <line/>strong detachment of cavalry, with a view to prevent 
         <line/>him from sending emissaries into the interior, and col<sh/>
         
         <line/>lecting horses. It is thought the insurgents will soon 
         <line/>have to re-embark ; for, as soon as they are a little 
         <line/>pressed for provisions, and fighting comes on, num<sh/>
         
         <line/>bers will desert. Those who have already come over 
         <line/>describe their situation as very critical. Two vessels, 
         <line/>one an English, and the other a French, were prepar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to sail from Callao for this place, and by them we 
         <line/>shall receive further particulars. The most enthusias<sh/>
         
         <line/>tic preparations were making in Lima to proclaim the 
         <line/>constitution in a formal manner, for which purpose 
         <line/>orders had been received from Madrid. This of itself 
         <line/>is sufficient to defeat all views Cochrane and San Mar<sh/>
         
         <line/>tin may have on the country, except, as before, a lit<sh/>
         
         <line/>tle plunder on the open and defenceless parts of the 
         <line/>coast.

         <line/>Letters from Sierra Leone, dated the 24th of Nov. 
         <line/>mention that the whole squadron was lying there.– 
         <line/>The Pheasant, Myrmidon, Snapper, and Thistle, were 
         <line/>lying off the Cape, waiting for the Morgiana to com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plete her water, provisions, &amp;c. which ship was oblig<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to be assisted by the squadron, in consequence of 
         <line/>her very sickly state. She had recently arrived from 
         <line/>the River Gambia, whither she had proceeded in dread 
         <line/>of attack by the natives on our infant colony there. 
         <line/>A letter of thanks had been voted to Captain Finlason, 
         <line/>by the merchants of that colony, for the very able man<sh/>
         
         <line/>ner in which he brought to an amicable conclusion the 
         <line/>differences between the Native Chiefs and the British 
         <line/>interests in the Gambia. The Morgania brought from 
         <line/>the Gambia, Dr Dochard and forty-six men belong<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to the mission under Major Gray, for exploring 
         <line/>Africa. Dr D. had been at Sago ; but, in conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of internal wars, he was unable to proceed 
         <line/>further. Major Gray was there with very few men ; 
         <line/>he will not proceed further for some time.

            <small_caps>Earthquake at Zante</small_caps>, Jan. 8.–The last week 
         <line/>has been a scene of horror and destruction at Zante.– 
         <line/>At four o'clock, on the morning of the 29th of Dec. 
         <line/>we had a violent shock of an earthquake, which lasted 
         <line/>nearly half a minute ; this was followed by eight other 
         <line/>shocks, between four and six o'clock, which threw 
         <line/>down one thousand three hundred houses. Providen<sh/>
         
         <line/>tially, the first shock did not throw down many, so 
         <line/>that the inhabitants had time to escape before succeed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing shocks, otherwise theloss would have been dread<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful. Only ten lives have been lost, but not a house 
         <line/>in the town has escaped without some injury. The 
         <line/>town is still in a complete state of confusion ; one 
         <line/>thousand give hundred houses more, being so much in<sh/>
         
         <line/>jured as to be marked in order to be pulled down ; all 
         <line/>the steeples in the place must be taken down. The 
         <line/>streets are almost impassable from the fallen houses ; 
         <line/>and great caution is required, in walking, to avoid the 
         <line/>ruins that are still falling.

            <small_caps>Emigration to Canada</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The following is an extract of a letter from a tradesman 
         <line/>belonging to Glasgow, who has been six years in Upper Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>nada, to a friend in this city :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"<i>York, Upper Canada, 14th November</i>, 1820. 
         <line/>"You wish to be informed of the encouragement that you 
         <line/>might meet with by an emigration to this country; and as 
         <line/>you have determined to place the most implicit confidence 
         <line/>in what I may advance. I shall therefore state to you the 
         <line/>"truth, and nothing but tl[?] truth, so help me <i>God</i>."– 
         <line/>In the first place, you wish to know what might be the va<sh/>
         
         <line/>lue of a hundred acres of land, with six or eight acres of 
         <line/>improvement. This is a question that I cannot give a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>cided answer to, as it depends entirely on the situation 
         <line/>where you wish to purchase; but I may with safety aver<sh/>
         
         <line/>age wild land, in this Upper Province, say at 4 to 6 dol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lars per acre, and the clearing or improving of each acre 
         <line/>will cost you from 16 to 20dollars.–In the next place, you 
         <line/>wish to know the price of cattle. They have never been 
         <line/>known to be cheaper than at the present time. A cow can 
         <line/>be purchased at 20 dollars, a pair of working oxen at 40 
         <line/>dollars; a good cart horse at 50 dollars,; sheep, 2 dollars a<sh/>
         
         <line/> piece. In regard to farming utensils, there are but few 
         <line/>used in this country at any time, and a new settler may be 
         <line/>some years in the woods before we want any more than an 
         <line/>axe, (3 dollars) a plough, (10 dollars) and a harrow, (5 dol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lars.)–You wish to know the nature of a Government 
         <line/>grant; that has now become no object, as the charges made 
         <line/>by Government exceed in many cases what you can pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>chase land for; and by buying land you have the advan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tage of choosing a situation agreeable to your mind; but 
         <line/>the reverse is the case when you accept of a grant from Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment, for you must then take your chance by drawing 
         <line/>by lottery; and as the land is already taken up for forty 
         <line/>miles round this place, you will then be obliged to go back 
         <line/>into the woods, and out of the world. You are at liberty 
         <line/>to sell it as soon as you receive the grant; formerly you 
         <line/>could.–You wish to know what sum you could estab<sh/>
         
         <line/>lish yourself for in this country as a farmer. There is one 
         <line/>thing obvious–the more you bring the less miseries and 
         <line/>difficulties you will have to undergo. But as a true friend, 
         <line/>I would advise you not to think of leaving home with a 
         <line/>sum less than &#x163;200 sterling with a sum less than this you 
         <line/>undoubtedly subject yourself to hardships and troubles 
         <line/>that you have no idea of. Though many have settled here 
         <line/>for nothing, their fate has been such that it is beyond my 
         <line/>pend to describe; and my greatest enemy I should not ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vise to come to this country, with the intention of farming, 
         <line/>with less capital than I have no stated to you. Many 
         <line/>may flatter you, and stuff your head with golden dreams 
         <line/>about this country; but you must allow the experience that 
         <line/>I have had to outweigh the statements of many that you 
         <line/>may have had an opportunity of talking with, who may pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>tend to have some knowledge of this country, for there 
         <line/>are but few settlements between Montreal and the falls of 
         <line/>Niagara (a distance of nearly 600 miles,) that I have not 
         <line/>visited.–As to the necessaries wanted for a family who may 
         <line/>think of coming to this country, I should entirely confine 
         <line/>myself to wearing apparel, as clothes are the highest article 
         <line/>in this country; and should you think of farming, I would 
         <line/>advise you to bring but few fine clothes, but principally 
         <line/>coarse and stout. Heavy luggage of any kind becomes very 
         <line/>expensive and cumbersome bringing you up the river so far as 
         <line/>this, and is often liable to be damaged, in consequence of 
         <line/>the repeated re-shipping. The rate of charge of the trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>portation of good from Montreal to Kingston (200 miles) 
         <line/>is 2 dollars per cwt.; and from Kingston to York (200 
         <line/>miles) they charge 1 dollar for each barrel bulk; and from 
         <line/>Montreal to York you may get a passage for 10 dollars for 
         <line/>each grown person.–By the by, you wish to know the po<sh/>
         
         <line/>pulation of this town: it is indeed small in comparison to 
         <line/>some of your towns; but I might say that the inhabitants of 
         <line/>York might amount to 3000 people. But there is no place 
         <line/>that I have visited in my travels that is more thriving than 
         <line/>this town; and as a proof, I can safely say that it is now 
         <line/>twice the size that it was when I came here, (now three 
         <line/>years), and still continuing to increase greatly in buildings; 
         <line/>but all wood.–You wish to know the different branches of 
         <line/>business carried on here. They are principally house car<sh/>
         
         <line/>penters; and various other mechanics are also employed 
         <line/>here.–You wish to know if any of the emigrants have ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rived in this place. There are but very few I understand 
         <line/>come thus far, the greater part of them having stopped at a 
         <line/>settlement called Perth, about miles below Kingston. 
         <line/>–Since I have now given answers to all your different 
         <line/>queries, let me now give my candid opinion respecting this 
         <line/>country. In the first instance, a farmer may live by hard 
         <line/>labour; that is, he may acquire a livelihood; but cash[?] is a 
         <line/>complete hidden treasure, and is as forbidden fruit to the 
         <line/>farmer of this country; and in some places you may live 
         <line/>for years and not even behold, a silver dollar through a glass 
         <line/>darkly, as all is done by barter in the country. The next 
         <line/>evil is the mixture of society; a very few good, intermixed 
         <line/>with a multitude of a very different character; but in many 
         <line/>places you will be divested of all society, either of a good 
         <line/>or bad quality; in either of which situations I am afraid you 
         <line/>will find yourself uncomfortable, in consequence of its 
         <line/>being so much different to what you have been accus<sh/>
         
         <line/>tomed to; and the opportunity of spending the sabbath 
         <line/>in a religious worship you will also find wanting. And 
         <line/>above all evils the fever and ague, that none escape, is 
         <line/>the ruin of many a family in this country. But should 
         <line/>you think of coming to this country, in order to avoid this 
         <line/>disease I would advise you to come no farther up the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try than Perth settlement, where this loathsome sickness 
         <line/>is seldom known. Now, my friend, by what I have stated 
         <line/>here I neither mean to advise or dissuade you from com<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to this country; but take it into serious consideration 
         <line/>before you embark upon this important."/&gt;

         <line/>We have received Canada Papers to the 10th May. 
         <line/>The active exertions of the Governor to improve the 
         <line/>inland navigation had given very general satisfaction. 
         <line/>In the course of the Session of the Colonial Parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, which was prorogued on the 14th April, no less 
         <line/>than three Addresses were presented to Earl Dalhou<sh/>
         
         <line/>sie, to be forwarded to the King ; one respecting the 
         <line/>allowance of half-pay to the Militia ; another respect<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the duties imposed in British ports on lumber from 
         <line/>Canada ; and third related to the losses sustained 
         <line/>by the people of Canada, during the late war. His 
         <line/>excellency the Governor had intimated, that no objec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion would be made to the repeal of the grant of 2,500l 
         <line/>on account of the Civil List for the Colony, provided 
         <line/>the salaray of the Chief retired Justice, the Receiver<sh/>
         
         <line/> General, and that of the Speaker of the House of As<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembly, should be continued, in the whole amounting 
         <line/>to 1,800l. The grant has for some time been a pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>minent subject of complaint in the Colonial Parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The 37th Regiment for three years stationed in 
         <line/>Lower Canada is about to leave the Colony for Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>land. The Staff Corps was to proceed to the Otta<sh/>
         
         <line/>wa, to carry into effect the intended plan for removing 
         <line/>the obstructions in that river. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>An article from Montreal, dated May 5, states, that 
         <line/>a messenger was leaving that place to announce the 
         <line/>union of the North and Hudson's Bay Compa<sh/>
         
         <line/>nies, at their respective establishments. The former 
         <line/>of these companies was under control of Lord Sel<sh/>
         
         <line/>kirk, and the schism that has so long reigned between 
         <line/>them, with its fatal consequences, is well know to 
         <line/>the Public. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>By Letters from Bombay we learn that 20 ships 
         <line/>have been taken up by the vigilant Governor, on board 
         <line/>of which 5000 troops are embarked, destined to the 
         <line/>Persian Gulph, to repair the disaster suffered by the 
         <line/>surprise of the detachment left by Sir Wm. Kier, un<sh/>
         
         <line/>der the direction of a young man. The gallant Gen. 
         <line/>Lionel Smith has been selected for this important ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vice ; and we have no doubt but that he will convince 
         <line/>the Arabs of the impolicy of their treacherous proceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings, and justify the high confidence which the Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment of Bombay have in his talents and valour.– 
         <line/>His Excellency Mr. Elphinstone, completely recover<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, is gone on a tour to Kutch, to settle all disputes, 
         <line/>and to ascertain the true situation of the country.– 
         <line/>How important it is for the Heads of the Presidencies, 
         <line/>thus to judge from actual observation, instead of trust<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to mere reports. This proves the benefits of ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointing men of experience and energy in the conduct 
         <line/>of our Indian Empire–which is now, throuh the 
         <line/>admirable conduct of the Governor General, and the two 
         <line/>other Presidencies, in a state of unexampled, tranqui<sh/>
         
         <line/>lity and prosperity.

         <line/>We have been favoured with the following ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tract of a letter from Captain Dixon, of the ship 
         <line/>Skelton, dated Hobert Town, Van Dieman's 
         <line/>Land, 29th November 1820 :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"We arrived here on the 27th inst. all in good health.– 
         <line/>This colony surpasses my expectation–climate very simi<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar to England, soil capable of any thing, where an industrious 
         <line/>manhas every thing to hope and nothing to fear ; the assist<sh/>
         
         <line/>ance given to settlers liberal, and grants of land to the a<sh/>
         
         <line/>mount of from 400 to 2000 acres given them, generally of ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>cellent quality. This colony in fact is the only country that 
         <line/>an Englishman should come to, he neither changes climate 
         <line/>not habits, for here every thing hat occurs to him is the 
         <line/>same, except burning wood for coals. The country on the 
         <line/>sea coast is very woody, but much easier cleared than Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>rica and about ten miles in the interior several miles of ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tent have no wood at all. The ships behaves beautifully, sails 
         <line/>well, and is easy ; we have never close reefed and not above 
         <line/>twice double reefed, and not strained a rope yarn nor 
         <line/>split a sail."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Extract of a letter received by My Leyden, 
         <line/>R. N. Leith, from his Son, Mate of the ship 
         <line/>Skelton, dated Sullivan's Cove, off Hobart Town, 
         <line/>29th November 1820 :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I take this opportunity of sending you a few lines by the 
         <line/>ship Guildford, which is to sail tomorrow for Baravia, and 
         <line/>then homewards. We left the Table Bay on 18th October, 
         <line/>and arrived here on 28th November, making a very good 
         <line/>passage. Did not see any vessel on the passage–made the 
         <line/>island of Amsterdam and St Paul's on 28 November–went 
         <line/>ashore on the island of Amsterdam for two or three hours, 
         <line/>found it to be barren entirely–only inhabited by give or six 
         <line/>people from the Isle of France, for the purpose of sealing. 
         <line/>When we came near the land, fell in with various winds 
         <line/>and calms–made the river on Sunday about twelve o'clock, 
         <line/>and brought up off Hobart, at three P M on Monday. The 
         <line/>country has a very fine prospect, a great deal of wood, but 
         <line/>interspersed with fields all in green, for it is the spring here 
         <line/>now–the pease are in full bloom. This town is very irregu<sh/>
         
         <line/>larly built, just like a Norwegian village–a deal of wooden 
         <line/>houses–the appearance of the country pleases the eye greatly 
         <line/>of the passengers, and the visit they had from the Deputy 
         <line/>Governor was very favourable. Governor M'Quarrie is to 
         <line/>be here from Sidney in the course of a fortnight or three 
         <line/>weeks to survey the Government works. The passengers 
         <line/>are in great suspense whether they will forward themselves 
         <line/>to Sydney, or wait until he comes. Butter sells at 4s, a lb ; 
         <line/>coarse ship biscuits 35s. a cwt ; a pair of ashets, middle size, 
         <line/>21s. and every thing in like proportion. Salted pork would 
         <line/>have sold very well–could clear L130 a cwt. Beef is about 
         <line/>6d. a lb. If you buy any here, and pay in produce, you pay 
         <line/>more than in hard cash. There are few bush rangers now, 
         <line/>they were mostly all shot in the woods. No encouragement 
         <line/>here for pickpockets. Some of the richest and most power<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful men here have once been sent out as convicts, but, from 
         <line/>their good behaviour, got their emancipation. The Midship 
         <line/>Leith, upon the pier, is here ; he is master of a colonial brig 
         <line/>trading between Sydney and here. Our passengers tell me 
         <line/>they can chuse what land they like ; but not the quality ; they 
         <line/>must apply the saw and the hatchet a great deal. A hatchet 
         <line/>costs 7s. 6d. a lb. Very few people have female servants, as they 
         <line/>can't trust them ; as those who come out are convicts, and 
         <line/>get soon married, so they have all men servants."/&gt;

         <line/>New York, May 8. 
         <line/>The sloop Hero, Capt. Palmer, arrived at 
         <line/>Stonington, last Tuesday, in seventy-three days 
         <line/>from New South Iceland, with a cargo of oil. 
         <line/>ON the 28th of March, in lat. 21. S. long. 35. W. 
         <line/>spokethe Brig Wilner, of London, from Buenos 
         <line/>Ayres, bound to Falmouth, England ; the Cap<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain of which informed Capt. P. that the Chilian 
         <line/>army, near Peru, had fought two battles with the 
         <line/>Royal army, in both of which the Chilian army 
         <line/>was victorious ; and it was supposed would cause 
         <line/>the surrender of Peru soon to the Chilians. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>May 15. 
         <line/>The gigantic projects that occupy the atten<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of our countrymen are truly surprising. A 
         <line/>plan is now forming, for example, to establish a 
         <line/>settlement at the mouth of the river Columbia, 
         <line/>for the purpose of importing teas direct from the 
         <line/>East Indies. It is then proposed to transport 
         <line/>this article of merchandize up the Columbia, un<sh/>
         
         <line/>til it reaches the rocky mountains, and then to 
         <line/>proceed by land to the navigable branch of the 
         <line/>Missouri. This embraces a space of three 
         <line/>hundred and forty miles in extent. Of this dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>tance 200 miles are represented by travellers as 
         <line/>constituting an excellent road ; the remaining 
         <line/>one hundred and forty comprehend the moun<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain barrier, which must be passed by the intre<sh/>
         
         <line/>pidity and labour of man. The merchandize 
         <line/>will then, by the aid of the Missouri and its 
         <line/>subsidiary streams, supply the whole western 
         <line/>continent with the refreshing beverage. This 
         <line/>shows the varied changes of commerse ; the 
         <line/>Atlantic States have heretofore been the medium 
         <line/>of supplying our western States with the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ductions of China ; but if this plan should be 
         <line/>carried into effect, we may receive our supply 
         <line/>from that country through the western States. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>May 16. 
         <line/>It is worthy of remark, that among the nu<sh/>
         
         <line/>merous arrivals at this port yesterday, were three 
         <line/>British brigs from Dundee. This makes good 
         <line/>the remark of a late Scotch gazette, that 
         <line/>Dundee was becoming a place of considerable 
         <line/>trade.

         <line/>Cape Coast Castle, April 21, 1821. 
         <line/>By the time you have received this, it is probable the 
         <line/>African Company will have ceased to exist ; we have 
         <line/>received orders to hold ourselves in readiness to deliver 
         <line/>up the Forsts and Settlements here to Government. It 
         <line/>is understood they are to be put on the same footing as 
         <line/>Sierra Leone. A list has been furnished to Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment by the Company's Committee, of their Officers, 
         <line/>their age, length of service, the situations they fill ; 
         <line/>their emoluments[?], &amp;c. We have been blockaded here, 
         <line/>since the 10th of February, by the Ashantees[?] (an Afri<sh/>
         
         <line/>can tribe), who have commenced hostilities against us. 
         <line/>On the day before mentioned, our Governor received 
         <line/>intelligence that a black man belonging to Cape Coast, 
         <line/>where the people are under our protection, had been 
         <line/>cruelly murdered by a Chief of the Fantes[?], at a place 
         <line/>about six miles from Cape Coast, called Moree[?]. I was 
         <line/>immediately ordered to assemble all the soldiers I 
         <line/>could, in five minutes, and proceed to Moree to seize 
         <line/>the murderer. I quickly set off with four officers and 
         <line/>85 soliders. A little before we entered the town of 
         <line/>Moree, where the savages, between 2 and 3,000 in 
         <line/>number, were assembled, we saw the mangled remains 
         <line/>of their unforunate victim. The town stands near the 
         <line/>top of a hill, on the summit of which is an old Dutch 
         <line/>Fort. As soon as we entered the town, a fire was 
         <line/>opened upon us ; but as my orders were to seize the 
         <line/>murderer, if possible, without bloodshed, I did not for 
         <line/>some time allow the men to return the fire. However, 
         <line/>perceiving they were resolved to oppose us, I gave di<sh/>
         
         <line/>rections to my little party to give them a volley and 
         <line/>then to charge. The negroes retired as we advanced, 
         <line/>and in less than an hour we gained the hill, from which 
         <line/>our opponents fled in every firection. We demanded 
         <line/>the keys of the fort from the principal man belonging 
         <line/>to Moree ; who not being engaged in the affair had re<sh/>
         
         <line/>mained, and who immediately gave them up. In the 
         <line/>fort, which has a draw-bridge, we were perfectly se<sh/>
         
         <line/>cure from the attack of the negroes. The body we de<sh/>
         
         <line/>feated were Fantees, who were assembled to assist the 
         <line/>Ashantees in enforcing some very unjust demands 
         <line/>made by them on the people of Cape Coast. As soon 
         <line/>as the Ashantees, who reside near Cape Coast, learned 
         <line/>that the Governor had sent an armed force against their 
         <line/>friends, their drum beat to arms, and they hastened 
         <line/>after us ; fortunately we had defeated our opponents 
         <line/>before they arrived. However, they rallied the Fan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tees, and took a position about half a mile from the 
         <line/>town, with a determination to oppose our little party. 
         <line/>The Governor, apprised of our situation, assembled 
         <line/>all the forces he could muster, and speedily about 500 
         <line/>of the Cape Coast people, headed by our officers, and 
         <line/>carrying the British flag, were seen approaching. The 
         <line/>enemy immediatel retired, and we were relieved from 
         <line/>our disagreeable situation, after having been from nine 
         <line/>in the morning till four in the afternoon exposed to a 
         <line/>burning sun, without refreshment. The negroes had 
         <line/>47 killed, and upwards of 100 wounded in this affair ; 
         <line/>we had one soldier killed, and four wounded. Since 
         <line/>the affair, we have not seen one of the Ashantees or the 
         <line/>Fantees here ; and a total stoppage of trade has taken 
         <line/>place. We have not learned how the King of Ashan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tee intends to act, nor is it safe to venture out of our 
         <line/>limits, except in large parties.

         <line/>left a small colony at Easter Harbour, consisting of 
         <line/>the following individuals:–R. Gibbs, of London 
         <line/>first officer of the Lord Melville ; G. Robertson, of 
         <line/>Hamburgh, second officer of the Minerva, a vessel re<sh/>

            <small_caps>New Brunswick</small_caps>.–A gentleman, who arrived here on 
         <line/>Thursday, in the schooner Active, from Eastport, in<sh/>
         
         <line/>forms, that the drought in the neighbourhood of St. 
         <line/>Croix river, the present season, has been unusually 
         <line/>severe, and that the fires in the woods have raged to a 
         <line/>more alarming extent than ever before known. Se<sh/>
         
         <line/>veral buildings have been burnt at the parish of St. 
         <line/>Stephen's on the British side of the river, others were 
         <line/>saved with a great difficulty. From Calais to Eastport, 
         <line/>about a fortnight since, the vessel in which our infor<sh/>
         
         <line/>mant took passage was entirely enveloped in smoke.– 
         <line/>In various places, the fires have been burning for six 
         <line/>weeks ; there had been no rain for eight weeks to wet 
         <line/>the ground.–<i>Boston Paper</i>.

      <p>
         <line/>Extract of a letter to a Lady in the vicinity of 
         <line/>Chelmsford, dated New Essex, Graham's Town, on 
         <line/>the frontiers of Africa, June 21, 1821:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I am seven hundred miles from the Cape 
         <line/>of Good Hope, and should not receive intelligence of 
         <line/>an arrival there for at least three weeks ; but my cor<sh/>
         
         <line/>respondent at Cape Town will procure comfortable 
         <line/>lodgings, &amp;c. until a ship sails for Algoa Bay, which 
         <line/>is distant from me one hundred and thirty miles.– 
         <line/>Few ships from England proceed farther than the 
         <line/>Cape. Good ploughmen are wanted, and good foot<sh/>
         
         <line/>ploughs, with spare wrought-iron shares and coulters, 
         <line/>which are very expensive here ; iron-work nothing 
         <line/>under 1s. per lb. Ransome's ploughs sell for 14l. 
         <line/>each. Ploughmen will find plenty of employers, at 
         <line/>from 2l. to 8l. per month and their board. Meat 
         <line/>sells at 2d. per lb ; wheat 12s. bushel ; and bar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ley 6s. Other articles of housekeeping are about the 
         <line/>same price as in England ; but, on the other hand, we 
         <line/>are in one of the healthiest climates in the world, and 
         <line/>free from rent, tithes, and taxes of every descrip<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion. Any one may live here as well with 500l. as in 
         <line/>his native land with 5000l. The farming work is still[?] 
         <line/>done with oxen, which are very fine, and bought at 
         <line/>3l. each ; cows are 30s. ; and sheep, 6s. a-head (hav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing tails that weight 8lb., a complete lump of fat) ; 
         <line/>clothes, linen, and all English goods, very dear.– 
         <line/>Good mechanics, of any description, have very high 
         <line/>wages. A cargo of Ladies would make a good specu<sh/>
         
         <line/>lation, in proceeding to the New Settlement ; for all 
         <line/>that came out with the settlers have got husbands."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>By letters received from the Cape of Good Hope, 
         <line/>we understand that the Royal African corps was dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>banded there on the 26th of June last. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>By letters from Bombay, dated the 24 of May, 
         <line/>we learn that the Governor, the Honourable Mr. El<sh/>
         
         <line/>phinstone, has returned to the Presidency, after a five 
         <line/>months' tour to the northward. He must minutely 
         <line/>examined all the judicial and revenue systems–furnish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the Collectors and Agents of Government with par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticular instructions for their guidance. He also sent 
         <line/>out strong detachments to reduce some predatory hordes 
         <line/>who have long plundered the country, and been a ter<sh/>
         
         <line/>ror to the peaceable natives. Those plunderers are 
         <line/>are called Bheels[?]. They live in the hills and woods, and 
         <line/>descend in bands to commit their depredations. By 
         <line/>these letters we learn, what is essential for young men 
         <line/>going out to India to know, that Writers and Cadets 
         <line/>now undergo an examination as to their knowledge of 
         <line/>the native languages ; and no youth has a chance of 
         <line/>success who is ignorant of the Hindoustanee[?]. The 
         <line/>highest respect is entertained for the able manner in 
         <line/>which the disinterested Dr. Gilchrist prepares young 
         <line/>men for the services. We rejoice to learn that the 
         <line/>Cholera Morbus has abated its rigour in the Deccan. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Batavia journals of the 28th April give an account 
         <line/>of a terrible earthquake which took place on the 29th 
         <line/>December last, on the south coast of Celebes. It did 
         <line/>immense damage, especially at Budekomba[?], where 
         <line/>the sea rose several times to a prodigious height, and 
         <line/>then falling in with the incredible rapidity, alternately 
         <line/>deluged and left the shore, destroying all the planta<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions from Bontain to Boelekomba[?]. Many hundred 
         <line/>have lost their lives. The fort of Boelekom-[?] 
         <line/>ba was much damaged, that of Bontain less so. On 
         <line/>the 4th of January this year, there was another shock 
         <line/>of an earthquake, but we do not learn that it did any 
         <line/>damage. 
         <column/>
         <line/>It is with much regret we lay before our readers the 
         <line/>following details of a most calamitous fire which broke 
         <line/>out at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 17th ult. : 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"<small_caps>Halifax</small_caps>, Sept. 17. 
         <line/>"The conflagration this morning was one of the 
         <line/>most awful and destructive every witness in Halifax. 
         <line/>It originated in Sackville-street, in the Bakery occu<sh/>
         
         <line/>pied by Shay and Milany, and before it was discover<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, had gained an alarming height. It was near two 
         <line/>o'clock when the bells were rung. The troops, sea<sh/>
         
         <line/>mean of his Majesty's ships, and inhabitants, soon as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembled ; the engines were judiciously placed, lines 
         <line/>formed to different reservoirs of water, and every exer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion made to extinguish the fire, but we regret to state, 
         <line/>that before any check could be given to it, the whole 
         <line/>block of buildings, with the exception of a house situ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ated at the corner of Sackville and Blowers'-streets, 
         <line/>occupied by Mr H. Croskill, the houses occupied by 
         <line/>Mrs. Neilson and Mr T. Muirhead, on Barrington<sh/>
         
         <line/> street, and a stable belonging to J. W. Johnston, Esq. 
         <line/>in Granville-street, were consumed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"For some time great apprehensions were entertain<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained that the fire would extend to the houses on the op<sh/>
         
         <line/>posite side of the streets, but fortunately it did not. 
         <line/>Of the property burnt only about &#x163;1500 were insured, 
         <line/>and the calamity has mostly fallen where it will long 
         <line/>be severely felt–upon windows and orphan children– 
         <line/>upon industrious tradesmen, whose whole stock of 
         <line/>worldly wealth was invested in the tenements they oc<sh/>
         
         <line/>cupied. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"To the troops, and the seamen of the ships of war, 
         <line/>the town is, as usual, greatly indebted for the exertions 
         <line/>made by them. Twenty-one houses were consumed, 
         <line/>with other valuable property."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>America appears to be very unhealthy just now– 
         <line/>The accounts from Long Island, Baltimore, Amelia 
         <line/>Island, and Norfolk, are extremely calamitous. The 
         <line/>whole of Amelia Island is a perfect hospital, not one 
         <line/>family being well, and in many instances not one to 
         <line/>assist another. So dreadful, indeed, is the disease, 
         <line/>that there is not one sentinel to do duty. A New 
         <line/>York Paper of the 30th ult. says– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We are sorry to perceive from the <i>Franklin Gazette</i>, 
         <line/>that the malignant fever continues to make serious ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>vages among our fellow citizens at Baltimore. Four 
         <line/>full victims to it in the 24 hours ending on Sunday 
         <line/>morning ; and six during the 24 hours ending Monday 
         <line/>morning.

         <line/>In our last paper, we gave, from the Jamaiza Ga<sh/>
         
         <line/>zettes, an account of the dreadful drought which had 
         <line/>prevailed in that island for more than twelve months 
         <line/>and the consequences of which had been most calami<sh/>
         
         <line/>tous. We are now, however, most happy, in being 
         <line/>able to state, upon the authority of a Gentleman who 
         <line/>left Jamaica some days subsequently to the date of our 
         <line/>preceding advices, that this terible evil, in such a cli<sh/>
         
         <line/>mate particularly, had at length ceased. The follow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing is the substance of the information which has been 
         <line/>communicated to us:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A few hours previous to my going on board the 
         <line/>Jamaica packet, on the 3d of September, the rain fell 
         <line/>in such torrents as to flood the streets of Kingston to 
         <line/>the depth of two feet, and it seemed to be general 
         <line/>throughout the district of Liguanea. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Though too late to save the crop of sugar for the 
         <line/>present, or, perhaps, the ensuing year, this seasonable 
         <line/>change of weather would at least have the effect of 
         <line/>staying the mortality among the cattle. As such, those 
         <line/>interested in the island will receive the intelligence 
         <line/>with gratification. On some properties, the canes had 
         <line/>been cut as fodder to save the stock."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>We have the Cape of Good Hope papers to the 6th Au<sh/>
         
         <line/>gust, and as they are unusually barren in their con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tents, it is fair to infer that every thing was proceeding 
         <line/>there in a satisfactory manner. The only article of 
         <line/>the slightest interest relates to the change the Governor 
         <line/>is gradually effecting in the currency, by removing 
         <line/>from it all the base metal, and substituting gold and 
         <line/>silver of standard value.

         <line/>The <i>Gazette of Dordrecht</i> publishes accounts from 
         <line/>Java to the 29th May. They confirm the statement of 
         <line/>the decrease of the malady, and mention, that it was 
         <line/>almost wholly subdued in the district of Samarang, 
         <line/>but that 18,000 persons, mostly Europeans, had fal<sh/>

            <small_caps>India</small_caps>–Extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated 
         <line/>June 20:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"If the extension of foreign trading be considered with 
         <line/>you as a means suited to alleviate the pressure, and ease 
         <line/>the difficulties of Old England, which we read of here, 
         <line/>we imagine that India can furnish beneficial openings to 
         <line/>this kind of remedy. The use of articles of British pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duction and exports is gaining ground rapidly here ; the 
         <line/>English printed cottons are now carried in considerable 
         <line/>quantities as far as Rajpootha, and find a ready sale, if 
         <line/>they be of handsome patterns. The warehouses now are 
         <line/>so far from being overstocked, that before the arrival of 
         <line/>two vessels from England in the last fortnight, all Euro<sh/>
         
         <line/>pean articles were exorbitantly high ; mustard flour sold 
         <line/>about 20s. a pound ; cheese 1[?] ; ham, three half crowns 
         <line/>the ld ; a common round hat, three guineas. These, 
         <line/>undoubtedly, were prices arising from an unusual scarci<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty ; but it surely cannot be so very bad a trading, 
         <line/>which admits, even, indicidentally, of such an exaggera<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of price and profit. Government bonds are now at 
         <line/>six per cent premium, though they bear but half the 
         <line/>usual or legal interest of the country. This is a tolerable 
         <line/>evidence of the credit of the Company and the Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. There is a great and increasing prosperity in Hin<sh/>
         
         <line/>dostan. The augmented cultivation of the Upper Pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vinces within these two years is surprising.

      <p>
         <line/>The following is an extract of a letter dated 
         <line/>Louisville, August 12th, 1820, from a Scotchman 
         <line/>who has been ong settled in America, to his friend, 
         <line/>a Scotch Farmer, who rents 500 acres of land in the 
         <line/>County of Middlesex. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The circumstances in which this country is 
         <line/>placed at present are truly melancholy, when com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pared to what they have been ; yet still it is a better 
         <line/>country to live in than Britain. It is not easy to 
         <line/>make money by farming, at present, in the United 
         <line/>States, for the want of a market; and I am of opi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nion that things will not mend, in this respect, for 
         <line/>some years, for all are sellers and none buyers. All 
         <line/>kinds of produce are selling, or rather offered for 
         <line/>sale, at one-third of what prices were two years ago. 
         <line/>Land, of course, has fallen in the same ratio. The 
         <line/>best of cleared land, within from 5 to 10 miles of 
         <line/>this town, is offered for them from 10 to 20 dollars an 
         <line/>acre. You will thence conclude that this is a fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>vourable time to purchase – and that for a man 
         <line/>who has a little money, and a large family able and 
         <line/>willing to labour with their hands, this is a most 
         <line/>excellent country, as he can easily raise on this cheap 
         <line/>land all the necessaries, and many of the luxuries, of 
         <line/>life. He will find it difficult to get gold or silver, 
         <line/>or even our own bad bank notes; but a man cannot 
         <line/>be badly off with more beef, mutton, pork and 
         <line/>grain, than he can dispose of. He has no rent to 
         <line/>make up by term day: his taxes are next to no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing, and although he may grumble to have to turn 
         <line/>his pigs into his corn field to save the expense of reap<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing it, or to see his apples rotting under his trees by 
         <line/>barn-fulls because he has not room or use for them, 
         <line/>yet still these are beatable distresses compared to those 
         <line/>of the poor farmers in our native land, and as I sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose in England. To the wealthier farmer the change 
         <line/>is not beneficial or desirable. It is true that if he 
         <line/>stays long in Britain he will soon become less weal<sh/>
         
         <line/>thy; yet still he would for some time regret the change. 
         <line/>He would miss many things made necessary by habit; 
         <line/>he would find his servants more lazy, and less obe<sh/>
         
         <line/>dient ; and he would even experience pain because the 
         <line/>modes of farming he is accustomed to will not do 
         <line/>here; but when he gets over these things, he 
         <line/>will find the advantage of the change. To say no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing of the difference of the Government, and the sat<sh/>
         
         <line/>isfaction of chusing one's own rulers, there are many 
         <line/>desirable things here. I estimate, as the greatest, 
         <line/>the ease of providing for one's family. A man may, 
         <line/>with very little exertion, leave to all his children 
         <line/>land enough to make them independent. Hence that 
         <line/>sickening anxiety about the future fate of a family 
         <line/>is little known here."/&gt;

            <center>Extract of a letter from an Englishman, dated Lima, Sep-</center>
         
         <line/>tember 10, 1821. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Lima is what an Englishman would call a dirty colo<sh/>
         
         <line/>nial town; 6000 inhabitants is the outside of its population; 
         <line/>the whites are about 1200 Europeans, and not as many 
         <line/>born in the country; the rest are blacks and mulattoes. 
         <line/>Of the mulattoes there are eight various shades. I never 
         <line/>saw such a wretched herd as Lima incloses; more poverty 
         <line/>and miserty than in any town of the size in the world.– 
         <line/>There are some few splendid houses, but the rest so dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>gustingly filthy that you cannot go into them without being 
         <line/>covered with dust and vermin. The streets, as in all A<sh/>
         
         <line/>merican towns, run at right angles; a powerful stream of 
         <line/>water in each : the town is capable of great improvement. 
         <line/>The climate must be bad, for the whole population look as 
         <line/>if turned out of the hospitals for a day's air; a half-born 
         <line/>race–melancholy in their faces. On the whole coast of 
         <line/>Peru we made the same observation; the ague very gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>ral, with fever–their habits and manner of living increase 
         <line/>the evil: thin clothing and vegetable diet–nights very cold 
         <line/>–I sleep under a heavy blanket, and could bear another; a 
         <line/>thick fog prevents the sun from coming out in winter; the 
         <line/>heat however is not excessive during summer; on the whole 
         <line/>not an oppressive climate, if the people had any idea of living 
         <line/>in a rational way. Very few families cook at home–they 
         <line/>buy their greasy messes boiled in the streets, in pulperias, 
         <line/>and in the squares: not six families in Lima that have wine 
         <line/>on their tables: they drink brandy at all hours, and excuse 
         <line/>themselves for not having any thing that is expensive, by 
         <line/>saying it gives the ague; the same person who denies him<sh/>
         
         <line/>self a glass of wine will lay twenty doubloons on a card in 
         <line/>the evening. Their money goes in gambling, debauchery, 
         <line/>and dress; every woman, high and low, has her price; a lady 
         <line/>take no offence at her frailty being exposed; she tells you 
         <line/>she is quite as good as her neighbours, and needs be no bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter. The Spanish nation and Government are the cause 
         <line/>of all the degradation of South America: every Viceroy, 
         <line/>from Pizarro to Pezuela, was a plunderer, a teacher of 
         <line/>immorality in words and deeds. The miserable state of 
         <line/>this people seems incredible–one must see to believe it : 
         <line/>scarcely a young lady can read or write, or use a needle; 
         <line/>few houses that the Devil has not appeared in; and a de<sh/>
         
         <line/>vout lady is accompanied in her carriage by the Virgin 
         <line/>Mary. Thus is ignorance imposed upon by knaves : as to 
         <line/>priestcraft, it reigns here in all its glory : a third part of 
         <line/>Lima is covered with churches, some of them very splen<sh/>
         
         <line/>did. The whole trade of this part of Peru depends on the 
         <line/>single mine of the mountain of Pasco for returns : if this 
         <line/>is worked to advantage, it will produce six millions of 
         <line/>produce. Mining may be carried to any extent, it is true; 
         <line/>but this requires tranquility and good government. Peo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ple in Europe have the most erroneous ideas of Peru; 
         <line/>every traveller and historian who has written or talked a<sh/>
         
         <line/>bout it ought to be made to stand in the pillory for a liar. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Arica, the second port of Peru, and the great outlet to 
         <line/>Upper Peru, is a wretched village of hovels covered with 
         <line/>mud–about 400 Mulattoes and Indians–placed on a sand 
         <line/>bank–the pepole all in the ague–not a boat or ship of any 
         <line/>sort. The harbour-master came off on a bulsa, (two blad<sh/>
         
         <line/>ders lashed together,) paddled by an Indian. We could not 
         <line/>get a basket of fruit or vegetables for money. Their culti<sh/>
         
         <line/>vation was three leagues off, but they were too lazy to 
         <line/>fetch any thing, though a seventy-four and a frigate lay-to 
         <line/>twenty hours, offering them any price for their tropical 
         <line/>fruits. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I hire a small room for 12 dollars a month, and sleep on 
         <line/>the ground; borrowed a chair, and bought some crockery 
         <line/>No such thing as a tavern : never was. Letters of no use; 
         <line/>no one asks me to his house. I go to bed at eight o'clock 
         <line/>to kill time. A play twice a week : the most fashionable 
         <line/>ladies stand up in the front boxes, and light a segar by the 
         <line/>chandlier; the house filled with smoke. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"There are 82 titled familes, mostly idiots–all reduced 
         <line/>to poverty by the emancipation of their slaves. If the war 
         <line/>be continued a year, Peru will be the most wretched coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try on the globe; indeed the Indians will regain their em<sh/>
         
         <line/>pire, and exterminate all other colours. The number of 
         <line/>blacks in the viceroyalty is estimated at seventy thousand– 
         <line/>25,000 in Lima and adjacent villages; the total population 
         <line/>of Peru about three millions–three-fourths Indians. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"About the town there are many fine gardens with pretty 
         <line/>country houses. Provisions of all sorts excellent, and in 
         <line/>the greatest variety; fruits of all climates in the market<sh/>
         
         <line/>place, the produce of the sea-shore and the Cordillera.– 
         <line/>Beef and mutton excellent–the chief supplies come from 
         <line/>Jauja an other vallies in the Cordillera. The sea-shore 
         <line/>produce is contiued to little vallies badly cultivated; those 
         <line/>about the town would disgrace the free negroes of Caro<sh/>
         
         <line/>lina. Most valuable land a league from the town, half 
         <line/>cultivated and half abandoned; every thing left to starved 
         <line/>slaves; such famished objects I never behald; no other hands 
         <line/>to cultivate. When emancipation becomes general, they 
         <line/>will not work, and famine must ensue. "/&gt;

            <small_caps>his Report</small_caps> only reached us yesterday ; but the So<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciety brings so much benevolence into activity, under the 
         <line/>guidance of practical wisdom, aided by very enlightened 
         <line/>views of the best interests of society, that we consider any 
         <line/>delay improper in calling the attention of the public to 
         <line/>their valuable proceedings. The present Report abounds 
         <line/>with evidence that they have not relaxed in their exer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions. At home, not only are the laws improving, but the 
         <line/>magistracy are carrying improvements into all the practical 
         <line/>departments. A great many jails, designed on much bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter principlpes, are in progress in different parts of the 
         <line/>country ; and in those which are used, it may be said, <i>ge</i>
            <sh/>
         
         <line/>
            <i>nerally</i>, that much more attentions is paid to health, clean<sh/>
         
         <line/>liness, diet, employment, and classification. It must not 
         <line/>be thought, however, that nothing remains to be done. 
         <line/>There are still jails in which prisoners are double ironed, 
         <line/>and chained to the floor of their cels from night to morn<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing ; others in which persons committed <i>for trial</i> are fet<sh/>
         
         <line/>tered with irons of the weight of from seven to nine pounds ; 
         <line/>and others in which debtors are exposed to the contami<sh/>
         
         <line/>nating society of criminals, in which neither the various 
         <line/>classes of prisoners, nor the two sexes, are kept separate 
         <line/>from each other, and in which all are allowed to be idle. 
         <line/>The Magistrates of Surrey have provided a <i>covered</i> vehicle 
         <line/>for conveying prisoners to the Sessions'house ; but in the 
         <line/>metropolis, it would appear, the practise still continues of 
         <line/>inflicting public degradation on parties arraigned or merely 
         <line/>suspected of crime, by marching them <i>handcuffed</i> through the 
         <line/>streets of London ; and, very recently, a party of <i>one hun-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>dred prisoners</i> were marched for a mile <i>handcuffed</i>
         
         <line/>through the open streets, <i>in order to be formally set at liber-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>ty by proclamation !</i> So much for metropolitan decorum ! 
         <line/>These shameful exhibitions and practises cannot, however, 
         <line/>long maintain their ground ; the publicity given to them, 
         <line/>through the proceedings of the Society should, of itself, be 
         <line/>enough to do them away ; but while they are continued 
         <line/>England should be somewhat chary of her boasts. The 
         <line/>views and principles of the Prison Society are attracting 
         <line/>notice and gaining ground in France, Switzerland, the Ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>therlands, Hanover, Bavaria, Wurtemberg, Denmark, Nor<sh/>
         
         <line/>way, Sweden, and Russia. At Christiana the Magistrates 
         <line/>have already resolved on the erection of a new city gaol. In 
         <line/>St Petersburgh the prisoners are now furnished with food, 
         <line/>clothing, baths, and medical assistance. A Ladies' Asso<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciation, under the patronage of the Princess <small_caps>Mesthersky</small_caps>, 
         <line/>is also in full activity at St Petersburgh ; and there is an 
         <line/>auxiliary prison society at Orel, on the very frontiers of Sibe<sh/>
         
         <line/>ria. Seven thousand prisoners passed through Orel last year ; 
         <line/>but their chains have been lightened, and their condition 
         <line/>meliorated generally, through the exertions of the Russian 
         <line/>Society. For details, however, we must refer to the Re<sh/>
         
         <line/>port itself ; but we cannot take leave of it without making 
         <line/>special notice of the benefits conferred on society by 
         <line/>the <i>Female Associations</i> and <i>Temporary Refuge</i>. The 
         <line/>almost miraculous power of kindness, when accompanied, 
         <line/>as genuine kindness often is, with quiet feeling and unob<sh/>
         
         <line/>trusive goodness, continues to be exemplified in the Ladies' 
         <line/>Committee, of which Mrs <small_caps>Fry</small_caps>, we believe, is still at the
            head. 
         <line/>In Newgate, idleness, dissipation, and licentiousness, have 
         <line/>been succeeded by industry, order, and restraint ; and the 
         <line/>same committee accomplish much good by visiting the ships 
         <line/>in which convicts are embarked for New South Wales. 
         <line/>Arrangements are thus made for the formation of schools 
         <line/>for moral and religious instruction during the voyage, and 
         <line/>the convicts are furnished not only with suitable clothing 
         <line/>and other necessaries, but the means of employment in the 
         <line/>manufacture of such articles as may be readily sold for their 
         <line/>relief on arriving at the colony. These are truly good 
         <line/>works ; and too much praise cannot be bestowed on the 
         <line/>Ladies by whom they are performed. It is gratifying to 
         <column/>
         <line/>observe that Female Associations for visiting prisons have 
         <line/>been established in Bedford, Bristol, Carlisle, Colchester, 
         <line/>Derby, Dumfries, Durham, Exeter, Lancaster, Notting<sh/>
         
         <line/>ham, Plymouth, York, and <i>Glasgow</i>. We had once thought 
         <line/>that, by this time, we might have added <i>Edinburgh</i> ; and 
         <line/>we are inclined to hope that the present Lord Pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vost will yet employ his influence in establishing a La<sh/>
         
         <line/>dy's Society for the prisons of our Metropolis.– 
         <line/>There, too, we had cherished, and still cherish, the hope, 
         <line/>of seeing a House of Refuge. The temporary refuge of 
         <line/>the Prison Society is chiefly for affording relief to distress<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed boys, who, on their discharge from the prisons of the 
         <line/>metropolis, have expressed a desire to abandon their crimi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nal courses. Many of these are in circumstances of urgent 
         <line/>want ; and " the Committee can now look round wtih plea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sure on many who are variously settled, and <i>conducting them-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>selves</i> exemplarily. In the temporary refuge they are 
         <line/>trained up to habits of industry, instructed in moral and 
         <line/>religious duty, and after a time are provided with suitable 
         <line/>situations." There is a great similarity in the histories of 
         <line/>the individuals admitted into this asylum ; but the greater 
         <line/>number, obviously, consists of boys, who had been almost 
         <line/>driven to commit petty thefts from want of employment or 
         <line/>destitution, or who, from neglect or loss of parents, had 
         <line/>fallen into the company of professed thieves. The Commit<sh/>
         
         <line/>tee mention that on one recent occasion, no less than <i>eight</i>
         
         <line/>boys were released from Newgate in one day, and imme<sh/>
         
         <line/>diately after they had undergone the sentence of <i>flogging,</i>
         
         <line/>which, upon some insane rule, is usually carried into ef<sh/>
         
         <line/>fect on the day of their discharge. Their persons are thus 
         <line/>marked with the stigma of guilt, and, from soreness and 
         <line/>want of strength, they are disabled from working, at the 
         <line/>very time they ought to go in search of employment. No 
         <line/>more effectual plan could have been devised to irritate these 
         <line/>boys against society, to prevent them from obtaining employ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, though desirous of it, or to impel them to recommence 
         <line/>their career of crime. We entreat those who are inclined to 
         <line/>look upon what they call a <i>smart whipping</i> as the only corrective 
         <line/>for juvenile offences, to reflect a little on the consequences 
         <line/>to which their system inevitably tends. <i>We</i> are decidedly, 
         <line/>and in all cases, against the deliberate infliction of pain, 
         <line/>merely to be felt as such. In the case of children, if not 
         <line/>
            <i>necessary</i> for that purpose, it will certainly give them the 
         <line/>idea of power superior to their own, and may thus be the 
         <line/>means of constraining more readily than otherwise ; but 
         <line/>
            <i>the law</i>, when it inflicts pain, has always other means of 
         <line/>evincing its power, and constraining those who are within 
         <line/>its grasp. Its most important function is to <i>prevent crime ;</i>
         
         <line/>its next is o convince those who comit offences that the 
         <line/>means of detection are, on the whole, so sure that no<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing is to be gained by the commission ; and its next, to 
         <line/>make restitution onerous and complete. There may also 
         <line/>be some classes of criminals who ought to be considered 
         <line/>and treated as <i>mad</i>–some are curable ; and some as incur<sh/>
         
         <line/>ably furious, who must either be cut off altogether, or 
         <line/>confined for life. We are not opposed to the infliction 
         <line/>of punishments, because in our opinion the most effec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tual of those will be found to consist in the best means 
         <line/>of preventing or remedying the evils produced by crime. 
         <line/>All exposures, restraints, constraints, and compulsory re<sh/>
         
         <line/>parations are punishments. We are only hostile to the inflic<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of pain for no other purpose but because pain is produced. 
         <line/>If it can be made <i>obvious</i> to the sufferers that the pain inflicted 
         <line/>
            <i>protects others</i>, or affords <i>true reparation</i> for the wrongs 
         <line/>done to them or society, we shall then grant that such pu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nishments may be both just and expedient. The Prison 
         <line/>Society, while they vindicate themselves, temperately but 
         <line/>firmly, from the charge of having yielded to a sort of blind 
         <line/>and irrational benevolence, and advocated measures which 
         <line/>went to raise the condition of prisoners above that of com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mon labourers, do still seem to us to have been too much 
         <line/>moved by the coarse jokes and reckless speculations of a 
         <line/>clever essayist. If they err at all, they seem now to be 
         <line/>somewhat too indulgent to the advocates of hard labour 
         <line/>and severe punishments. We are rather inclined to think 
         <line/>them too decidely in favour of the tread mill, which they 
         <line/>allow has been so worked or constructed at different places 
         <column/>
         <line/>as to form very unequal measures of punishment, and they 
         <line/>very properly insist that every tread-mill should be pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vided with " a regulator," by which its rate of revolution 
         <line/>may at all times be restrained within safe limits, and a 
         <line/>dial-register, (lately invented by Mr <small_caps>Bate</small_caps>, instrument<sh/>
         
         <line/> maker to the Board of Excise) by which the rate of labour 
         <line/>may be, at any time, accurately ascertained, and which 
         <line/>( they think ) should in no case exceed 12,000 feet in ascent 
         <line/>for one day. There is an able argument in the report against 
         <line/>compelling persons to labour who are merely imrpisoned 
         <line/>
            <i>for trial</i> : and there is a great mass of curious and useful 
         <line/>information in the Appendix.

         <line/>In January, 1823, there were 3,031 in the hulks ; 2,138 have 
         <line/>been received since ; 1,402 have been sent to New South Wales ; 
         <line/>and 300 to <i>Bermuda</i> ; 468 have been discharge by pardon or 
         <line/>transferred to other establishments ; 3 have escaped ; 43 have died ; 
         <line/>and 2,953 remained in the different hulks on 1st Janury last. 
         <line/>The health of these prisoners has been good, their conduct or<sh/>
         
         <line/>derly. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Office-bearers of the <i>Refuge for the Destitute</i> have, during 
         <line/>the last year, given relief to 424 persons. They have apprenticed 
         <line/>to trades, recommended to service or employment, or restored to pa<sh/>
         
         <line/>rents and friends, 214 individuals :–under their charge at present 
         <line/>154. Most of the male culprits require to be kept two years at 
         <line/>least. The expenditure has been very considerable. Mr Peel has 
         <line/>recommended a grant from Parliament. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>As we feared, the bill introduced for the purpose of qualifying 
         <line/>persons possessed of personal property to serve as juries contains 
         <line/>no regulations for the more impartial striking of juries, or returning 
         <line/>or making up of those who are to serve on each jury. There does 
         <line/>seem to be an improvement on the <i>form</i> of the returns to be made 
         <line/>by the Constables to the Sheriffs.

         <line/>Repeated instances have lately occurred, in whcih dwelling<sh/>
         
         <line/> houses have suffered damage by fire, owing to the carelessnes of 
         <line/>servants and others, who, by way of economy, take off fires at 
         <line/>night and put the burning coals under the grate, not recollecting 
         <line/>that, in the construction of almost every house, the stone placed 
         <line/>under the grate is supported by timber, separated from the hearth 
         <line/>stone by some lime only. The wood underneath being once ig<sh/>
         
         <line/>nited, the fire will rapidly spread, and may in a few hours involve 
         <line/>the whole tenement in flames.

            <small_caps>Emigration to Australia.</small_caps>–We understand that the esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blishment of an Australian Company has suggested to a num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber of public spirited individuals the idea of forming a society to 
         <line/>aid deserving persons in their endeavours to emigrate and settle in 
         <line/>New South Wales and Van Dieman's Land, and that matters are 
         <line/>actually in progress for carrying this benevolent project into effect. 
         <line/>On Wednesday a meeting was held in the Freemasons' Hall, Niddry 
         <line/>Street, which was respectably attended, the Rev. Mr Lothian in 
         <line/>the Chair, when a series of resolutions were moved by William 
         <line/>Ellis, Esq. S. S. C., and seocnd by Robert Paul, Esq. of the 
         <line/>Commercial Bank. The principal object comprehended in those 
         <line/>were the security of the persons and property of emigrants on the 
         <line/>voyage–the maintenance of a regular communication with friends 
         <line/>left behind, and the insuring a friendly welcome, temporary ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>commodation, and facilities for permanent settlement in the country 
         <line/>of their adoption. It was also proposed to give assistance in 
         <line/>money to deserving emigrants, for the purpose of defraying the 
         <line/>expenses of freight and passage out–every applicant being first 
         <line/>well recommended, and his character subjected to strict scrutiny. 
         <line/>Masons, wrights, smiths, and other artisans, schoolmasters, farm<sh/>
         
         <line/> servants, and labourers, are the classes to which the principles of 
         <line/>the society specially apply.

      <p>
         <line/>According to the opinion of persons largely engaged in the silk<sh/>

         <line/>On Sunday evening a disturbance took place in a house in 
         <line/>Tobago Street, and the Police were called, who, to make sure of 
         <line/>the rioter, secured the door ; at which a young woman, a servant, 
         <line/>became so much alarmed, that she leaped out of a window, situat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed on the third floor, whereby her back was broken. She now lies 
         <line/>very ill in the Royal Infirmary.

            <small_caps>Mr Secretary Peel</small_caps>, in moving the commitment of the Trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>portation Bill, stated, that the objects of the bill were, first, to 
         <line/>continue the laws on transportation, that would expire before the 
         <line/>next session ; and next, to cimplify the law. In the last session 
         <line/>a bill had been passed to enable the Crown to make an experiment 
         <line/>of the union of the hulk and transportation system, by sending 
         <line/>convicts to Bermuda. There had been as yet hardly time to de<sh/>
         
         <line/>cide fully on the experiment, but, as far as it could be judged of, it 
         <line/>was satisfactory. It had been hithero complained that transporta<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion was a very esqual punishment, and certainly there was a great 
         <line/>different in the effect of the punishment upon a man of settled ha<sh/>
         
         <line/>bits, and with a family, and upon a man of no fixed habits, to whom, 
         <line/>as hitherto managed, it had scarcely been a punishment. He wish<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed it to be known, that arrangements had been made in New South 
         <line/>Wales, to send some of the convicts to a distant part of the set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlement, where the punishment would be more severe. A selection 
         <line/>would be made from the convicts, so as to make the punishment 
         <line/>efficient against those to whom it had hitherto had no terror.– 
         <line/>He gave this statement because it was right the public should 
         <line/>know that transportation would be henceforward a real punishment.

         <line/>Mr Greig, after stating the correspondence which took place be<sh/>
         
         <line/>tween him and the Fiscal, which led to the suppression of his jour<sh/>
         
         <line/>nal, gives the following account of his interview with that func<sh/>
         
         <line/>tionary. "On Monday evening, the Fiscal sent a messenger to 
         <line/>me, requesting I would call at his house, in Strand-street; I did 
         <line/>so ; he then opened a conversation upon the subject of my paper, 
         <line/>
            <i>The South African Commercial Advertiser</i>, and said he was in<sh/>
         
         <line/>structed to inform me that I had departed from the Prospectus – 
         <line/>that it was become obnoxious to the Government, and referred 
         <line/>more particularly to the last three or four Numbers. I asked him 
         <line/>to point out such parts as were immediately objectionable. He then 
         <line/>mentioned some <i>leading remarks</i>, which (he said) bore upon the 
         <line/>Administration of the Colony. He further pointed out as "<i>ob-</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>noxious,</i>" all quotations which had been made from " De Lolne[?],"/&gt;
         <line/>"Blackstone," and " Civil Servant's"work " Lacon," and, ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>nerally all extracts relative to the Liberty of the Press, observing 
         <line/>–" Nobody can doubt the obvious tendency of these ; and, as we 
         <line/>are not men in this Colony, but merely infants," it was, in his opi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nion, dangerous to insert such matter. He added, also, that it was 
         <line/>expected I should, in future, publish no parts of trials, but wait 
         <line/>until the whole were finished ; and, even then, all scurrilous parts 
         <line/>(such as the Memorial of Mr L. Cooke to the Treasury), were to 
         <line/>be omitted. That I was further to bound down with two sure<sh/>
         
         <line/>ties, in the penalty of ten thousand rix-dollars, that nothing of the 
         <line/>offensive nature pointed out, should appear in any future number ; 
         <line/>and, lastly, that I was to take particular care, that the next num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber (18) contained no matter of the description alluded to, nor any 
         <line/>notice of Mr Edward's trial. To all this, I replied, that I would 
         <line/>give no promise as to what would appear in the next or any future 
         <line/>number. That I required time to consider what was fitting to be 
         <line/>done with regard to the security demanded."/&gt;

         <line/>
            <i>The Morning Chronicle</i> makes the following remarks on this 
         <line/>case :– We cannot say that we are surprised that acts of this de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scription should take place in our Colonies. Uncontrouled power 
         <line/>produces every day in Europe the worst effects on men of the best 
         <line/>dispositions, and the best talents, and the Governors of our con<sh/>
         
         <line/>quered Colonies, and New South Wales, are unfortunately 
         <line/>quite absolute. In Europe the people under absolute Governments 
         <line/>have this advantage over the people in our colonies, that men in 
         <line/>office are generally selected with some reference to abilities and ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>quirements. But with the exception of the East Indies, the Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>nernment of which, with all its faults, generally, we believe, avails 
         <line/>itself of talents, our colonies are unfortunately considered as mere 
         <line/>places of refuge for the relatives of our Aristocracy, of whom nothing 
         <line/>can be made in this country. This is what constitutes fitness for a 
         <line/>Colonial Office ; and so far from being astonished at the disgrace<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful scenes which are constantly taking place in the colonies, every 
         <line/>person capable of reflecting at all upon the matter would be asto<sh/>
         
         <line/>nished were he to find common abilities the holder of a colonial 
         <line/>appointment of any value. Of Lord Charles Somerset, the less that 
         <line/>is said the better. In fact nothing is more wanted than the perusal 
         <line/>of a Cape of Good Hope Almanack, to satisfy the British public 
         <line/>what sort of personage he is. Would it be believe, that in a 
         <line/>country of boundless extent, with only a settlement here and there, 
         <line/>where the greatest enemies the Colonists have to contend with, are 
         <line/>the wild animals, it could possible enter in to the head of any ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>rional being to introduce laws for the preservation of game&gt; One 
         <line/>would as soon expect to hear laws in Turkey for the preservation 
         <line/>of the plague. Yet it so happens, that a code which would do 
         <line/>credit to Sir John Shelley himself, guarding against the possible 
         <line/>disinction of the game of Africa, occupies a goodly space in the 
         <line/>Cape Almanack. After such a specimen of wisdom, all criticism on 
         <line/>this personage would be thrown away.

            <i>Love in a Prison.</i>–We have all heard that "Love 
         <line/>rules the court, the camp, the grove" but we have 
         <line/>rarely heard that the little god delighted to dwell in 
         <line/>prisoned solitude ; true it is and of verity, nevertheless, 
         <line/>that he seems, if not to have fixed his dwelling in, at 
         <line/>least to be a very constant visitor of, our jail. It is not 
         <line/>long since a couple, who had imbided the tender pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion, were linked in the bonds of matrimony in it ; and 
         <line/>a like consumnation, most devoutly to be wished for 
         <line/>by another pair of inmates, would ere now have taken 
         <line/>place, did not envious bolts and bars intervene, for a 
         <line/>petition has been presented by two delinquents of dif<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferent sexes, both under sentence of transportation, to 
         <line/>the Magistrates, praying that they may be allowed to 
         <line/>marry before setting out for New South Wales. The 
         <line/>fond pair never saw each other till inclosed in the same 
         <line/>vehicle on their way to stand trial at last Perth Circuit, 
         <line/>for capital offences ; yet, in this situation, love–omni<sh/>
         
         <line/>potent love–took the captives captive, and rendered 
         <line/>them in its enjoyment, even in their perilous plight, 
         <line/>"o'er a' the ills o' life victorious." But, alas! " the 
         <line/>course of true love never did run smooth;" and no less 
         <line/>a personage than the Secretary of State for the Home 
         <line/>Department has in this case crossed the path of the hap<sh/>
         
         <line/>less couple, and doomed them to single blessedness for 
         <line/>many a year, by ordering the "fair penitent" to be re<sh/>
         
         <line/>moved to Penitentiary at Millbank for seven years, 
         <line/>instead of transportation for fourteen ; leaving the for<sh/>
         
         <line/>lorn lover to seek consolation in the charms of some 
         <line/>
            <i>sterling</i> or <i>currency</i> damsel in the land of promise, to 
         <line/>which he must now wend his solitary way.–<i>Fife Hld.</i>

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the motion of Mr <small_caps>Estcourt</small_caps>, the house resolved 
         <line/>itself into a committee on this bill. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the clause that no brewer who should himself sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>ply public houses with beer, should be allowed to act or 
         <line/>assist as a Magistrate at any meeting or session for the 
         <line/>granting of licenses, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Bernal</small_caps> moved that this clause be struck out 
         <line/>altogether. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>R. Gordon</small_caps> supported the clause. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Monck</small_caps> thought this the most valuable clause 
         <line/>in the bill, and that it was no infringemnt, but a sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>lutary interference with the jurisdiction of borough 
         <line/>magistrates. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Strangers were ordered to withdraw, and the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mittee divided, when there were–Ayes 46–Noes 53– 
         <line/>Majority against the clause 7. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Several amendments, verbal and otherwise, were then 
         <line/>agreed to, amongst which was the omission of the 
         <line/>words " Cinque Ports," thus excluding that class of 
         <line/>places from the operation of the bill. 
         <column/>
         <line/>On the clause being proposed relative to the hours 
         <line/>during which public houses should be kept open on 
         <line/>Sundays. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Estcourt</small_caps> said, the original clause was to the 
         <line/>effect that public-houses should be closed during the 
         <line/>hours of morning and afternoon's divine service, but he 
         <line/>thought it would be better not to permit publicans to 
         <line/>allow drinking or tippling on their premises till after 
         <line/>the usual hour of the conclusion of morning service 
         <line/>(one o'clock.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>After a conversation, in which several hon. members 
         <line/>participated, the clause was agreed to. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Several other clauses having been then read and agreed 
         <line/>to, the house resumed ; the report was brought up, or<sh/>
         
         <line/>dered to be taken into further consideration on Monday 
         <line/>next, and printed.

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>P. Thompson</small_caps> moved the second reading of the 
         <line/>usury laws amendment bill. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Davenport</small_caps> said he should oppose the bill, as 
         <line/>he considered it to be highly injurious both to the land<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed and commercial interests. The hon. members moved 
         <line/>an amendment, that the bill be read a second time that 
         <line/>day three months. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The question on th amendment having been put, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The <small_caps>Chancellor</small_caps> of the <small_caps>Exchequer</small_caps>
            suggested 
         <line/>the propriety of postponing this bill until the next ses<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion of parliament. He made this suggestion from no 
         <line/>unfriendly feeling towards the bill, but merely because 
         <line/>this was not, he conceived, the most convenient time to 
         <line/>consider it. The subject ought to be fully considered, 
         <line/>with a view to get rid of evils that existed, without in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terfering with long-continued prejudices. If the dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>cussion were postponed he would give the subject the 
         <line/>best attention in his, (<i>hear</i>.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Heathcote</small_caps> approved of the suggestion of the 
         <line/>right hon. gentleman, and wished the discussion on the 
         <line/>question to be postponed till the next session of parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps> L. Foster</small_caps> thought that, between the total repeal, 
         <line/>or the continued existence of the Usury Laws, in their 
         <line/>present shape, a middle course might be steered. Of 
         <line/>the bill before the house he thought that, under the 
         <line/>guise of a simple enactment, it covered one of the great<sh/>
         
         <line/>est illusion ever held forth to Parliament or the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, for he was convinced that it would effect as com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plete and as practicable a repeal of the usury laws as 
         <line/>could be proposed. It became necessary, therefore, to 
         <line/>consider the probable operation of that repeal upon all 
         <line/>the great interest of the country. The bill might give 
         <line/>relief to few, but would bring injury to many. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Lord <small_caps>Palmerston</small_caps> thought the house indebted to 
         <line/>the hon. member for Dover for bringing in the bill. It 
         <line/>might be possible to form a bill better than that of the 
         <line/>hon. member, but his bill was better than the present 
         <line/>law, and as such he should vote for it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The gallery was then cleared, and the house divided, 
         <line/>when there appeared for the second reading,–Ayes, 52;

         <line/>ing certain amendment introduced into it. It would

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Sir <small_caps>R. Wilson</small_caps> moved, as an amendment, that the

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>H. Gurney</small_caps> seconded the amendment.

      <p>
         <line/>The question was then put on the amendment, which

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Ferguson</small_caps> proposed the insertion of a clause,

      <p>
         <line/>Sir <small_caps>H. Hardinge</small_caps> said, he had another resolution to 
         <line/>propose, but it was in which he expected that a re<sh/>
         
         <line/>duction would be made next year. It was, that a sum 
         <line/>of L283,199, 8s 1d be granted for the expenses of the 
         <line/>disembodied[?] militia of the united kingdom.

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Spring Rice</small_caps> said, that within the last twelve 
         <line/>years there had been two millions and a half expended 
         <line/>on this body, and that the subject was one which few 
         <line/>gentlemen took the trouble to look at. He begged to say 
         <line/>a word upon the Irish militia. There the whole of the 
         <line/>staff, which was larger than that of England, was with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out a private man. Nothing could a more outra<sh/>
         
         <line/>geous job than that of the milita in Ireland. The co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonels kept the whole patronage of the regiment, and 
         <line/>kept up the bands for the amusemen of themselves and 
         <line/>friends. The militia might have been of service at one 
         <line/>time in Ireland ; but since that time the present effec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive police had been established, and quite superseded 
         <line/>it. He trusted Ministers would not suffer this to remain 
         <line/>if they really wished to be economical, and curtail, if 
         <line/>not abolish it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The <small_caps>Chancellor</small_caps> of the <small_caps>Exchequer</small_caps>
            begged to 
         <line/>assure his hon. friend that he wanted no prompting to 
         <line/>make any economical reduction. When, however, a 
         <line/>plan for the reduction of the staff was ready, and it was 
         <line/>in contemplation, it would be laid before Parliament, 
         <line/>and he should then be the friend of the definite and li<sh/>
         
         <line/>mited powers to which he had alluded. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> said, the militia had been defended as 
         <line/>though the country were in hourly danger of invasion 
         <column/>
         <line/>–as if the country could be taken by surprise. If that 
         <line/>were so, he would gladly learn of what use were the 
         <line/>spies, who cost us L450,000 a-year. We had ambas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sadors–they were very little better than spies–at an 
         <line/>expense of L450,00a-year ; and if their cautious ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>servance were not sufficient to save the country from 
         <line/>sudden invasion, he knew no better means, and he cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tainly knew no other advantage which ambassadors and 
         <line/>consuls could be of.

         <line/>Sir <small_caps>J. Mackintosh</small_caps> said, the object of his present

         <line/>to propose two instruction to the committee on the bill 
         <line/>which the right hon. gentleman (Mr Huskisson) had 
         <line/>introduced–first, to the effect that the committee should 
         <line/>recommend the introduction of a clause for the esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blishment of a trial by jury in New South Wales and 
         <line/>Van Diemen's Land; and secondly, that it should re<sh/>
         
         <line/>commend that a clause be introduced, providing for the 
         <line/>election of one-third of the Legislative Council from 
         <line/>among persons enjoying an income of L100 a year, and 
         <line/>having been free inhabitants of the colonies for the space[?] 
         <line/>of three years. The best local authories in fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>vour of his proposition. Among these he might men<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion the names of Governor Hunter, Governor Bligh, 
         <line/>Mr Bent, the Judge Advocate, Governor Macquarrie, 
         <line/>and his successor Sir Thomas Brisbane, who had gone 
         <line/>out to the colony prejudiced against the introduction in<sh/>
         
         <line/>to it of these institutions ; but, after two years careful 
         <line/>investigation of the subject, wrote home in Oct. 1825, 
         <line/>stating, that there was now no longer any doubt 
         <line/>about its perfect ripeness for them.–(<i>Hear, hear.)–</i>
         
         <line/>The partial introduction of English institutions into 
         <line/>immediate practise was the only pledge of a real inten<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion on the part of government to introduce them more 
         <line/>completely in the end. The right hon. gent. concluded 
         <line/>by moving that instruction be given to the committee 
         <line/>to recommend the introduction of Trial by Jury into the 
         <line/>colony, and to allow the inhabitants a voice in the le<sh/>
         
         <line/>gislative councils. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> said, in the bill which he had intro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duced, it was intended to extend the privilege to the 
         <line/>government of the country of granting trial by jury 
         <line/>in all civil cases. His right hon. friend would find, if 
         <line/>he examined, that the foundation would be laid of grant<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the inhabitants of that colony a share in managing 
         <line/>their own concerns. At present the legislature propos<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, by way of a first step, to appoint a legislative com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mittee for the purpose of watching and controuling 
         <line/>every measure of the state. All trials should be public, 
         <line/>under the inspection of a free press, and a population 
         <line/>jealous of their rights. They should now be prepared 
         <line/>in the course of a few years for the regular introduc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of a legislative assembly ; not had he any fears 
         <line/>when such a change should take place, that it would 
         <line/>lead to any political convulsion. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> had every reason to believe, that if, in<sh/>
         
         <line/>stead of inflicting a military governemtn, they would 
         <line/>introduce a portion of representation and the privileges 
         <line/>of British subjects into New South Wales, it would be

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Horace Twiss</small_caps> said, the knowledge of one fact

            <i>Bervic.</i>–There has been raised this season on the 
         <line/>high lands of the farm of Hallgreen, belonging to Mr 
         <line/>Blair, a few acres of <i>Rib-grass</i>, a native plant of New 
         <line/>South Wales. It was imported to this country two 
         <line/>years ago by a man who had served his time in Van 
         <line/>Dieman's Land. Its[?] favourite soil seems to be high 
         <line/>land or muir country, and is so rapid in growth, that it 
         <line/>appears not only to choke but to extirpate[?] every weed 
         <line/>with which it comes in contact. It is said to be the 
         <line/>best plant in the world both for feeding cattle, and for 
         <line/>producing mik from cows, of the best and richest qua<sh/>
         
         <line/>lity. Were the propiertors and tenants of the Highland 
         <line/>country to follow the enterprising conduct of Mr Blair, 
         <line/>we would soon see their hills covering with a truly useful 
         <line/>plant, instead of the useless heath, with at present, even 
         <line/>at best, only adorns them.

            <small_caps>House of Commons.</small_caps>–<small_caps>June 4</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Sir J. <small_caps>Mackintosh</small_caps> presented a petition from Mr 
         <line/>Charles Buck, complaining that managers of theatres 
         <line/>were allowed to perform dramatic pieces without the 
         <line/>knowledge or leave of the writer, and without any pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>fit to him. The hon. member said that Lord Byron 
         <line/>and Mr Millman had made similar complaints, and that 
         <line/>every person who had given that subject consideration 
         <line/>admitted that literary property was not sufficiently pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>tected in this country, and that the decline of dramatic 
         <line/>writing was to be attributed to the state of the law. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr G. <small_caps>Lamb</small_caps> thought it a very serious grievance that 
         <line/>if a man wrote a tragedy it might be taken by any ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nager, and performed on the stage, and the writer 
         <line/>brought to the miserable condition of a <i>damned</i> author 
         <line/>
            <i>nolens volenns</i>. (<i>A laugh.</i>) The decline of dramatic 
         <line/>writing in this country was to be ascribed to the unpro<sh/>
         
         <line/>fitable nature of that description of writing, as compar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed with other branches of literature ; and it would be 
         <line/>very desirable if a dramatic author had power to sell his 
         <line/>play like any other description of property, and that no 
         <line/>manager should perform it without paying the writer, 
         <line/>which was the system in France. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The petition was ordered to be printed.

            <small_caps>Birmingham Petition.</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Brougham</small_caps> rose to present a petition from a very 
         <line/>respectable body. It had been agreed to at a numerous 
         <line/>meeting of manufacturers, artisans, and other inhabi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tants of Birmingham, and was signed by 8000 persons 
         <line/>without solicitation. they contended that the distress 
         <line/>which now prevailed, not only had reference to that 
         <line/>poorer classes of society, but spread itself over the whole 
         <line/>system of society. This distress the petitioners ascrib<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to the tampering that had taken place with the cur<sh/>
         
         <line/>rency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid 
         <line/>upon the panic which had taken place in 1825 ; for, 
         <line/>though it was true that a great number of failures had 
         <line/>taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, 
         <line/>that of about 70 bankers who had failed, as many as 
         <line/>80[?] had subsequently paid 20s in the pound. If such 
         <line/>were the case he was very glad to hear it. The opinion 
         <line/>of the petitioners rather was, that the present distress 
         <line/>arose from the speculations and over-trading which had 
         <line/>taken place ; and that such might have been the case 
         <line/>topitally[?], there could be no manner of doubt, That a 
         <line/>great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from 
         <line/>the depreciation of the currency, by which people were 
         <line/>now paying taxes at a rate that had never been intend<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed when they were originally imposed, was extremely 
         <line/>likely ; but whether it operated to the extent that the 
         <line/>petitioners described was another question. In the year 
         <line/>1819 he had been one of those who had resisted the im<sh/>
         
         <line/>position of new taxes, because he thought that that was 
         <line/>the very worst time that Ministers could have chosen 
         <line/>for such an object. His opinion, however, had been 
         <line/>over-ruled, and the taxes had been increased. That 
         <line/>the effect of this must be to cripple the industry of the 
         <line/>country no man could doubt ; and what he wished was 
         <line/>to see a remedy for t ; but the misfortune was, that 
         <line/>after making every possible retrenchment–by reducing 
         <line/>salaries, and dealing in the best possible way with all 
         <line/>the payments which the nation had to make–the Dead 
         <line/>Weight would still remain round the neck of the coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, and press it down to the effectual injury of its best 
         <line/>interests. How were they to get over the 800 millions 
         <line/>of debt, and the 30 or 40 millions of interest annually 
         <line/>payable thereon? In the latter part of the petition he 
         <line/>entirely agreed, and hoped that every thing would be 
         <column/>
         <line/>done to give the people as great relief from the pressure 
         <line/>of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to 
         <line/>the public credit, and the service of the State ; and so 
         <line/>far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he 
         <line/>thought that the petitioners were wrong in their obser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vations on the tampering of the currency, the more he 
         <line/>was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which 
         <line/>appeared to him to be founded on truth. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Bennett</small_caps> was of opinion that the forced resto<sh/>
         
         <line/>ration of a metallic currency was one of the principal 
         <line/>causes of the present distress. The taxes were now 
         <line/>paid in money, and it now required twice the produce 
         <line/>to pay them which it did before the year 1819. That 
         <line/>was nothing less than a robbery, but how it was to be 
         <line/>remedied he really was at a loss to know. He would 
         <line/>never break faith with the public creditor, and the only 
         <line/>means to pay off our public debt would be to impose an 
         <line/>income tax. If the public debt were once removed, 
         <line/>then free trade could take place in every branch of 
         <line/>trade, but not till then. Such was the opinion of his 
         <line/>late friend, Mr Ricardo, and sooner or later he thought 
         <line/>some such measure would be resorted to. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Alderman <small_caps>Waitham</small_caps> observed that it was 
         <line/>strange that while the public distress was admitted to 
         <line/>be extreme, no effort was made to reduce the public ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>penditure. He was ready to prove that the export trade 
         <line/>of the country had fallen off to the amount of from 
         <line/>nearly nine to thirteen millions, although he knew that 
         <line/>in saying this he was encountering serious adversaries. 
         <line/>He did not under-rate our export trade ; it was valuable 
         <line/>but for a period of thirty-one years it had fallen off at 
         <line/>the rate of six millions per annum ; and this could be 
         <line/>shewn from Parliamentary documents. With respect 
         <line/>to the petition now before the house, he mainly agreed 
         <line/>with its statements, while at the same time he could 
         <line/>never consent to any thing like a breach of faith with 
         <line/>the public creditor. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>W. Whitmore</small_caps> heard with astonishment that 
         <line/>our foreign trade had greatly diminished, the reverse 
         <line/>being so notoriously the fact. Since 1814 there was 
         <line/>certainly a fall in the value of our manufactures, but so 
         <line/>there was in the raw material, and the vast increase of 
         <line/>machinery should also be taken into account. It was 
         <line/>said that our exports had declined, but facts would 
         <line/>prove decidedly the reverse. From 1790 to 1799, the 
         <line/>exports were L17,000,000 ; from 1800 to 1809, 
         <line/>L,26,000,000; from 1810 to 1819, L36,000,000 ; from 
         <line/>1821 to 1826, L45,000,000 ; in 1827, L51,000,000 ; and 
         <line/>in 1828 the amounts of exports rose to L52,000,000– 
         <line/>So much for the alleged decrease of our export trade, as 
         <line/>stated by the worthy Alderman, (<i>hear, hear, hear.</i>) 
         <line/>In 1819[?] the currency was in the greatest state of depre<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciation ; but he begged pardon for having said so much, 
         <line/>and he was induced to offer a word in order to counter<sh/>
         
         <line/>act the danger which might arise if the statements of 
         <line/>the worthy Alderman remained unanswered. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Sec. <small_caps>Peel</small_caps> observed, that, whenever any change, 
         <line/>however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made 
         <line/>in the system of our currency, it must be attended in 
         <line/>the first instance with considerable inconveniences. 
         <line/>The more he considered the subject, the more was he 
         <line/>convinced that the best interests of the nation required 
         <line/>that we should strictly adhere to the law of our cur<sh/>
         
         <line/>rency now established. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>) He hoped he 
         <line/>should never see the time when the restrictions on cash 
         <line/>payments should be renewed. When, however, the 
         <line/>petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the 
         <line/>amount of our currency by an issue of paper, he would 
         <line/>ask them what they would, in that case, do with the 
         <line/>Exchanges? If the Exchanges fell, the gold would 
         <line/>go out of the country. What would they do? They 
         <line/>must renew the restriction on cash payments by the 
         <line/>Bank. It was not any change in the value of the cur<sh/>
         
         <line/>rency, but the prosperity of Manchester that had occa<sh/>
         
         <line/>sioned the depression in Spitalfields. In 1820, the 
         <line/>number of factories in Manchester were fifty-four, and 
         <line/>they were assessed at the annual value of L16,816 ; in 
         <line/>1823 they were 56, assessed at L18,293 ; in 1826, when 
         <line/>the small notes bill passed, the numbers were 72, asses<sh/>
         
         <line/>sed at L24,034 ; in 1828, the year before the small 
         <line/>notes bill took effect, the numbers were 73, and they 
         <line/>were assessed at L25,245. The hon. gentleman oppo<sh/>
         
         <line/>site had said that no fresh capital had been employed 
         <line/>in this trade, but that persons would work at a loss ra<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther than let their machines stand idle. But if this 
         <line/>were the case, it would not account for the erection of 
         <line/>12 new factories, the establishment of which was irre<sh/>
         
         <line/>concileable with the idea of general stagnation. With 
         <line/>respect to the silk trade in Manchester, in 1823 there 
         <line/>were 2500 looms, and in 1828 there were 8000 ; and 
         <line/>there were between 3 and 4000 looms working ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nufactured articles of silk mixed with cotton. He had 
         <line/>had a letter from Manchester, dated 1st of June, upon 
         <line/>which he could rely, and it stated that all the silk weav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ers were, or might be, in active emply. For the last 
         <line/>ten years at Manchester, machinery had improved in 
         <line/>powers of production in the ratio of 10 per cent, per an<sh/>
         
         <line/>num. Few persons had attributed enough to the im<sh/>
         
         <line/>portation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number 
         <line/>of Irish labourers in the manufacturing districts were 
         <line/>out of emply than people could imagine, and the Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>gistrates relieved them rather than pass them to their 
         <line/>parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the 
         <line/>prosperity ot the places, they had a right to relief when 
         <line/>in distress. Where the passage was so low, and this 
         <line/>country possessed the advantage of a legal provision 
         <line/>for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of 
         <line/>Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important 
         <line/>alterations in the state of the law. (<i>Hear, hear.</i>) He 
         <line/>felt convinced that any alterations with respect to the 
         <line/>values of the currency would be attended with the great<sh/>
         
         <line/>est evils to every class. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps> W. Horton</small_caps> observed, that some honourable 
         <line/>gentleman considered the distress of our artisans and 
         <line/>manufacturers to arise from the state of the currency ; 
         <line/>but he (Mr Horton) was at a loss to see how the redun<sh/>
         
         <line/>dant labour at Shipley could have been affected by the 
         <line/>change of the currency. Another class were the anti<sh/>
         
         <line/>podes of these–they imputed our distress to the corn 
         <line/>laws. But it was idle to talk of altering the corn laws; 
         <line/>we should look to practical remedies. As long as a re<sh/>
         
         <line/>dundancy of labour existed in England, which was ag<sh/>
         
         <line/>gravated by the condition of the Irish, who flocked to 
         <line/>England, and operated a still further prejudice to the 
         <line/>labouring class of this country, the distress would con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tinue. The remedy which he proposed for the evil he 
         <line/>had pointed out was emigration, in the manner propos<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed in the report of a committee of which he had the ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>nour to be the chairman, by parishes advancing a sum 
         <line/>of money to locate pauper labourers in our North Ame<sh/>
         
         <line/>rican colonies. The right hon. gentleman then read 
         <line/>opinions in approbation of his plan, from Mr Tooke, 
         <line/>Mr Malthus, Colonel Torrens, and others, and observ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed that he had the opinion of the late Mr Ricardo to 
         <line/>the same effect, in a lette which had been published. 
         <line/>He then entered into a calculation, to show the saving 
         <line/>to parishes by this plan, and he challenged any member 
         <line/>of the house the show the fallacy of the calculations.– 
         <line/>There was, however, an answer so easy, that it was con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stantly made–" The vacuum would be filled up im<sh/>
         
         <line/>mediately." This was a delicate subject to touch 
         <line/>upon, for he knew not how the vacuum could be fill<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed up but by the introduction of young gentlemen 
         <line/>and ladies. (<i>A laugh</i>.) But was it supposed that 
         <line/>fifty labourers would be replaced immediately by fifty 
         <line/>children? Or did these objectors suppose that labour<sh/>
         
         <line/>ers would be brought from Russia or elsewhere ? The 
         <line/>right honourable gentleman then adverted to the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>marks in Mr Sadler's work, wherein it was stated that 
         <line/>is appeared from the official documents that the mor<sh/>
         
         <column/>
         <line/>tality amongst the emigrants to North America had 
         <line/>been in the unprecedented proportion of 4 in 14, where<sh/>
         
         <line/>as, in Wales, the proportion was 1 in 69, and in Eng<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, 1 in 57. This, he would assert, was an incorrect 
         <line/>statement. So far from the proportion being 1 in 14, 
         <line/>it was only 1 in 40, the same proportion which existed 
         <line/>in Carlisle, the healthiest place in England. The emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grants, it should be recollected, carried out children, 
         <line/>and the mortality amongst children was in the propor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of 1 in 12, and in London much greater ; for it had 
         <line/>been ascertained that out of 1,000 infants amongst the 
         <line/>poor, only 542 survived the period of nursing. The 
         <line/>right hon. gentleman concluded with reading his last 
         <line/>resolution–" That it is expedient that such measures 
         <line/>should be adopted in the next Session of Parliament as 
         <line/>may furnish the most safe and effectual means of pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducing the desird improvement, by a judicious appli<sh/>
         
         <line/>cation of both these principles, and at the same time 
         <line/>under conditions which will prevent the probability of 
         <line/>a recurrence of similar evils, and also effect a material 
         <line/>saving of the national income, instead of producing an 
         <line/>increased charge thereon."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> contended that colonization ought 
         <line/>to be encouraged. Had it not been for emigration, 
         <line/>this country could never have reached its present state 
         <line/>of importance and prosperity, nor would our language 
         <line/>have been extended to the United States, and been 
         <line/>adopted in more distant countries. If there were one 
         <line/>circumstance more striking than another, it was the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>digious increase of consumption, a proof of the growing 
         <line/>wealth and resources of the country. In the year 1814, 
         <line/>the exchange in trade was against us ; now it was in 
         <line/>our favour. This country would carry on its great affairs 
         <line/>with as small a portion of metallic currency as possi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble, but let them guard against a system which had led 
         <line/>to depreciation of the currency, and the panic which 
         <line/>was felt in 1825. He had heard somewhere a meta<sh/>
         
         <line/>phor respecting paper currency. Like a skyrocket, it 
         <line/>rose with splendour, but lost its brightness, and when 
         <line/>its fire was extinguished it fell in darkness, like the 
         <line/>shaft of the rocket, upon the heads of those who had 
         <line/>raised it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Secretary <small_caps>Peel</small_caps> said, in consequence of the 
         <line/>course of policy which he had deemed it advisable to 
         <line/>adopt in the previous Session, a series of unfounded ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>lumnies had been levelled at him, which, however, he 
         <line/>had despised too much to condescend to notice. But 
         <line/>there was one which, as it reflected on his public and 
         <line/>official character, he would, with permission of the 
         <line/>house, allude to on that occasion. The report to which 
         <line/>he alluded was, that he had used his influence as Secre<sh/>
         
         <line/>tary of State to procure an enormous grant of land 
         <line/>for a relative of his. (<i>Hear, hear, hear.</i>) In conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of seeing this report in the public newspapers, 
         <line/>he had requested his right honourable friend to move 
         <line/>in that house, for the production of certain papers cal<sh/>
         
         <line/>culted to explain the whole matter. Those papers 
         <line/>had in consequence been produced, and were now 
         <line/>printed ; he trusted, however, that the house would 
         <line/>excuse him for again alluding to the subject. (<i>Hear,</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>hear, hear.</i>) He hoped that the consequence of those 
         <line/>papers being printed would have been, that some mem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber would have asked some questions on the subject ; 
         <line/>but though this was not the case, he had received a 
         <line/>communication which made him think that some one 
         <line/>out of doors had been imposed upon by the calumny, 
         <line/>though no member of that house had been so deceived, 
         <line/>(<i>cheering</i>.) He begged in the first place, to state 
         <line/>most distinctly that he had procured no grant of land 
         <line/>for any brother of his, (<i>hear</i>) A gentleman, whose 
         <line/>name was the same as his, and who was his second 
         <line/>cousin, had had a grant made him by his right hon. 
         <line/>friend ; but in that grant he begged to state to the 
         <line/>house, upon his word of honour, as a gentleman, he had 
         <line/>had no participation whatever, (<i>hear</i>.) With respect 
         <line/>to the settlement on the Swan River, he was ashamed 
         <line/>to say that he had neither heard nor knew of it, till he 
         <line/>received a letter from his cousin, announcing to him 
         <line/>that he had abandoned the idea of going to New South 
         <line/>Wales ; and that from the circumstances of Mr Twiss in<sh/>
         
         <line/>forming him that government would be disposed to afford 
         <line/>assistance to any settlers going to the Swan River, he 
         <line/>and three other gentlemen had been induced to send in 
         <line/>a proposal to that effect. With respect to the other 
         <line/>calumnies which had been promulgated against him, 
         <line/>they rather went to private matters, and he had there<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore not condescended to notice them ; but as this one 
         <line/>had reference to the public department in which he of<sh/>
         
         <line/>ficiated, he had thought it so far a public concern, as 
         <line/>to venture to ask the attention of the house while he tres<sh/>
         
         <line/>passed on it to disclaim any participation in the grant 
         <line/>that had been made, (<i>hear.</i>) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Sir <small_caps>Geo. Murray</small_caps>–The house would probably 
         <line/>think, after the statement of his right honourable friend, 
         <line/>that it would be unnecessary for him to rise to address 
         <line/>them, (<i>hear</i>.) He was satisfied that the house knew 
         <line/>that his right hon. friend was incapable of proposing 
         <line/>anything that would come under the designation of 
         <line/>what was vulgarly called a job, (<i>hear</i>.)

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Secretary <small_caps>Peel</small_caps> gave notice that he should to<sh/>
         
         <line/>morrow move the adjournment of the house to that day 
         <line/>week. The right hon. gentleman at the same time 
         <line/>presented a petition from the Apothecaries Company 
         <line/>of London, in favour, as we understood, of the bill re<sh/>
         
         <line/>garding dissection. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Wilmot Horton</small_caps> rose to propose the resolu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions of wich he had given notic relative to the state 
         <line/>of the labouring poor. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The firt resolution having been put from the chair,

      <p>
         <line/>The <small_caps>Chancellor</small_caps> of the <small_caps>Exchequer</small_caps>
            moved as

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Bennett</small_caps> opposed the resolutions. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The amendement was agreed to without a division. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Labouchere</small_caps> postponed until to-morrow his

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Otway Cave</small_caps> moved the following resolutions: 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Resolved, 1st. That no human legislature has any 
         <line/>lawful power to abridge or destroy the natural rights 
         <line/>of life and liberty, unless the owner shall himself com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mit some criminal act that amounts to a forfeiture. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"2d, That although neither the government nor the 
         <line/>legislature of the county have arrogated to them<sh/>
         
         <line/>selves the power of destroying the natural rights 
         <line/>of innocent British subjects, or of delegating any 
         <line/>such power to other authorities, it is a notorious 
         <line/>fact, that in many British Colonies lying remote 
         <line/>from the immediate observation of the Government, 
         <line/>innocent British born subjects are, from the time of 
         <line/>their birth, robbed of their natural rights, and converted 
         <line/>into slaves. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"3. That it is the especial duty of this House, as the 
         <line/>Representatives of the people, to take effectual measures 
         <line/>for protecting all British subjects that shall be born 
         <line/>henceforward in the West Indian Colonies, from simi<sh/>
         
         <line/>lar violations of their natural, inherent, and paramount 
         <line/>rights as human beings."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The motion being seconded by <small_caps>Mr Lumley,</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>W. Smith</small_caps> said, he could not give his support to 
         <line/>these resolutions, because they were connected with a 
         <line/>question of too much importance to be agitated in such 
         <line/>a manner, and at such a period of the Session. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Huskisson</small_caps> was of opinion that resolutions of 
         <line/>such a description as those brought forward by the hon. 
         <line/>member, ought to be met by a direct negative. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Strangers were then ordered to withdraw. The reso<sh/>
         
         <line/>lutions were declared to be negatived without a division. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The other orders of the day were then disposed of, and 
         <line/>the house adjourned at half-past one o'clock.

            <i>Swan River.</i>–The fine ship <i>Gilmore</i>, purchased by 
         <line/>Mr T. Peel, brother to the Secretary of State for the 
         <line/>Home Department, proceeded down the river on Satur<sh/>
         
         <line/>day, on her voyage to Swan River. The <i>Gilmore</i>
         
         <line/>quitted the St Catherine Docks in the course of Friday, 
         <line/>having on board an excellent assortment of every re<sh/>
         
         <line/>quisite which may be required to form the new settle<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. Mr Thomas Peel has had the <i>Gilmore</i>, which 
         <line/>is of 500 tons burthen, under his own inspection, as 
         <line/>well as the selection of the agricultural and other imple<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments to convey to the Swan River. There were many 
         <line/>passengers on board. Mr Peel and his family, it is 
         <line/>understood will join the vessel at Plymouth. In the 
         <line/>vessel there are also going out other settlers. The 
         <line/>
            <i>Hooghly</i>, another ship of 500 tons burthen, chartered 
         <line/>by the same individual, is not yet quite ready for her 
         <line/>voyage. Among the valuables sent out to Swan River 
         <line/>are some fine race-horses, intended for breeding in the

            <i>The Revenne.</i>–Ever since the beginning of the quar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter, symptoms of progressive improvement have mani<sh/>
         
         <line/>fested themselves in the revenue. Of late they have 
         <line/>assumed a more decided and promising character, and if 
         <line/>the seven weeks that remain prove as productive as the 
         <line/>first month has been, not only will thre be no falling 
         <line/>off at the close, but a considerable increase may confi<sh/>
         
         <line/>dently be anticipated. We understand that the general 
         <line/>return of duties paid at Custom-house in the port of 
         <line/>London, for the month o July last, amounts to one 
         <line/>million one hundred and ten thousand pounds. The re<sh/>
         
         <line/>turns from the out-ports have not all yet been received, 
         <line/>but, on a fair calculation, it is supposed that they will 
         <line/>amount to above one million sterling.–<i>Courier.</i>

         <line/>is founded upon one of the fictions of an early Italian 
         <line/>novelist (Lasca), the incidents of which almost include

            <i>Steam Navigation.</i>–Information has reached the

         <line/>A communication by steam between this country and 
         <line/>the Mediterrarean has already been opened, and might,

            <i>Swan River.</i>–That beautiful ship, the Gilmour, 
         <line/>sailed on Monday evening for the Swan River. She 
         <line/>has upwards of 200 passengers on board, the whole of 
         <line/>whom are highly respectable, and many of them are in 
         <line/>opulent circumstances. When Mr Peel came alongside 
         <line/>(accompanied by Mr Soltau), just before the ship got 
         <line/>under weigh, the passengers and crew gave him three 
         <line/>cheers, and his reception altogether was of the most 
         <line/>gratifying description. The property on board the

            <i>Gurney's Steam Carriage.</i>–Yesterday afternoon Mr 
         <line/>Gurney's steam carriage was exhibited, at the request 
         <line/>of the Duke of Wellington, in the Houslow Barrack 
         <line/>yard, before his Grave, the Ladies Percy, Dance, and 
         <line/>Murray ; Lords Fitzroy Somerset, Rosslyn, and Tho<sh/>
         
         <line/>mas Cecil ; Lieut. General Sir W. Gordon, Quarter<sh/>
         
         <line/>Master General ; Sir George Murray, Sir Charles Dance, 
         <line/>and a large number of military and scientific gentlemen. 
         <line/>His Grace, Sir W. Gordon, the Ladies Percy, &amp;c. had 
         <line/>a carriage attacked, and rode round the yard with the 
         <line/>greatest pleasure and satisfaction. Afterwards a wag<sh/>
         
         <line/>gon was fastened to the steam carriage containing 27 
         <line/>soldiers besides Mr Gurney and two or three men on 
         <line/>the engine, and though the road was very disadvanta<sh/>
         
         <line/>geous, being a rough loose sand and gravel, it drew 
         <line/>them round without the least diminuition of its speed, 
         <line/>between nine and ten miles an hour. In these experi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments Mr Gurney applied his steam generally but to 
         <line/>one wheel in order to give the company full proof of 
         <line/>the power and practicability of the invention. Having 
         <line/>satisfied them as to this, and as to its manageability, 
         <line/>by a variety of involutions and evolutions, he gave them 
         <line/>a specimen of its speed, and drove seven or eight times 
         <line/>round at the rate of 16 or 17 miles an hour. It is 
         <line/>difficult to say whether the company was more pleased 
         <line/>or surprised at these unequivocal proofs of Mr Gurney's 
         <line/>success. The Duke of Wellington observed that it 
         <line/>was scarcely possible to calculate the benefits we should 
         <line/>derive from the introduction of such an invention as 
         <line/>this.

         <line/>The French papers of Tuesday state that the Em<sh/>
         
         <line/>peror Nicholas was preparing to make a new levy at the 
         <line/>rate of 4 upon every 500 male individuals, which would 
         <line/>give about 160,000 fresh soldiers. He is said, however, to 
         <line/>have deferred promulgating the ukase until he should 
         <line/>have ascertained that the Porte had definitely rejected 
         <line/>the terms of peace which he had proposed. On the 
         <line/>other hand, we are told that the Sultan has rejected those 
         <line/>terms, and that, notwithstanding the successes gained 
         <line/>by the Russians, he was resolved to run all the chances 
         <line/>of a desperate struggle rather than submit to conditions 
         <line/>which he deemed insulting.

            <i>The English Bench.</i>–There are two vacancies at 
         <line/>present on the judicial Bench ;–one occasioned by the 
         <line/>death of Mr Baron Hullock ; the other by the more 
         <line/>recent decease of Mr Charles Warren, Chief Justice of 
         <line/>Chester, who expired at his house in Bedford Square, 
         <line/>on Wednesday afternoon, in the 66th year of his age. 
         <line/>Mr Campbell is spoken of as the successor of the for<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer ; and the choise, we supposem will be generally 
         <line/>deemed to be a proper one. With respect to the Chief 
         <line/>Justiceship of Chester, an evening paer, the <i>Sun</i>, very 
         <line/>properly recalls to public recollection the fact, that "the 
         <line/>Commissioners on the Common Law had recommended 
         <line/>in their report, the abolition of the Welsh judgeships 
         <line/>altogether;" and adds an opinion, in which we per<sh/>
         
         <line/>fectly coincide, tht " the present seems a fair op<sh/>
         
         <line/>portunity for carrying the recommendation into effect."/&gt;
         <line/>Indeed, in our mind, every opportunity is a fair one

            <i>Platina Coin.</i>–We have seen a specimen of the

            <i>Ugly Wives Fittest for Poets.</i>–The spouses of the 
         <line/>living British poets are well known to be among the plain<sh/>
         
         <line/>est of the <i>sect</i>, as <i>Mr Slinslop</i> would say.–is wed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ded to the head of a gorgon, – – is not much better 
         <line/>off, – – has eloped from his mate. We might run 
         <line/>through the whole catalogue, without discovering a 
         <line/>handsome woman, yet none have exceleed these writers 
         <line/>in descriptions of female beauty. The truth is, that 
         <line/>the contemplation of a bottle or peaked nose, a wide 
         <line/>mouth, goggle eyes, and a spare body, causes an author 
         <line/>to set out with more enthusiasm in search of the ideal 
         <line/>of womanly perfections, and affords the widest scope to 
         <line/>the imagination. Nothing impedes the fancy more 
         <line/>domestic intercourse with a celestial shape and di<sh/>
         
         <line/>vine face ; in which case a fatal uxoriousness supersedes 
         <line/>the poet's diligence, and he ceases impotently to de<sh/>
         
         <line/>scribe what he can well enjoy. Milton's Eve was not 
         <line/>copied from Mrs Milton grilling his dinner at the kitch<sh/>
         
         <line/>en fire–but from some unattainable damsel of his fan<sh/>
         
         <line/>cy. Plurality of women is only allowed to a poet– 
         <line/>one lawful, plain, household wife–and as many airy 
         <line/>mistresses as he can embody.

            <i>Swan River.</i>–The ship Warrior, Stone, command<sh/>
         
         <line/>er, bound to Swan River, Sydney, and the East Indies, 
         <line/>sailed for her destination on Friday, from Portsmouth, 
         <line/>with prospects of favourable weather in her progress 
         <line/>down the Channel. The Warrior is a fine vessel of 
         <line/>about 700 tons burden, and carried out upwards of 250 
         <line/>passengers to the new settlement. Several of the pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sengers are persons of independent fortune, who have 
         <line/>embarked considerable property in the speculation ; and 
         <line/>and two ofthem, named Byrne and Molloy, paid the 
         <line/>enormous sum of L1,000 for the best accommodation 
         <line/>the vessel could afford their families and suite. Six 
         <line/>pianos are on board the Warrior, and a proportionate 
         <line/>number of fair and accomplished vocalists and musicians 
         <line/>of course accompany the instruments to their destina<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion. The Warrior has also on board fifty dogs of the 
         <line/>choicest breed, several pens of sheep, considerable 
         <line/>number of swine, two milch cows, and three valuable 
         <line/>horses ; but, as tempestuous weather may be antici<sh/>
         
         <line/>pated on the vessel reaching the Bay of Biscay, appre<sh/>
         
         <line/>hensions are entertained that a portion of the live cargo 
         <line/>must be consigned to the ocean before the termination 
         <line/>of the voyage. It is calculated that, from the advan<sh/>
         
         <line/>tageous arrangements entered into by the commander 
         <line/>and a gentleman named Semple, who has chartered the 
         <line/>Warrior, and gone out in her, they will clear the enor<sh/>
         
         <line/>mous sum of L10,000 by the voyage.

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It will be seen from our private letter, that unfavou<sh/>
         
         <line/>rable accounts respecting his Majesty's health were cir<sh/>
         
         <line/>culating in London at 7 o'clock on Wednesday even<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing. In our last we alluded to the suspicions which 
         <line/>the non-appearance of bulletins for four days after the 
         <line/>first, gave rise to. On Monday a second bulletin ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>peared, certainly not of a character to remove the pub<sh/>
         
         <line/>lic anxiety, and this has been followed by two days' 
         <line/>silence. Every one naturally puts the question, "If 
         <line/>his Majesty is better, why not state this in a bulletin, 
         <line/>that the thousand discouraging rumours in circulation 
         <line/>may be put to rest?" The <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
         
         <line/>says, that the high officers of State are not much 
         <line/>better informed on the subject than others, and that 
         <line/>a knowledge of his Majesty's real condition is 
         <line/>confined to the very few immediately around his 
         <line/>person. In the absence of correct information, infe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rences are drawn from every passing circumstance. It 
         <line/>was observed that Sir Henry Halford very shortly after 
         <line/>his return from Windsor on Tuesday morning had a 
         <line/>long interview with the Duke of Wellington ; and it 
         <line/>has not escaped notice, that his Majesty's sister, the 
         <line/>Duchess of Gloucester, had been sent for to visit him. 
         <line/>The <i>Globe</i> says, that according to reports which are 
         <line/>circulated in high quarters, his Majesty's illness ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>cites considerable alarm, and that gout in the 
         <line/>stomach is complicated with dropsical symptoms. 
         <line/>What credit may be due to these statements, we 
         <line/>cannot tell; but whether they be true or false, 
         <line/>they furnish a reason for the publication of offi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cial intelligence. The King's health is a matter 
         <line/>which concerns the public deeply, and all mystery and 
         <line/>deception on the subject are most reprehensible. We 
         <line/>refer to our London head for a variety of articles upon 
         <line/>the subject ; and if this night's mail bring any addi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tional information of importance we shall publish it 
         <line/>in a secoond edition.

         <line/>that so masterly a paper, dealing in great and immu<sh/>
         
         <line/>table principles, should have its value lessened by 
         <line/>being so much mixed up with ephemeral matters, and

         <line/>rency. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The passion for emigrating to Swan River has not 
         <line/>received any check. There are four ships now at Lon<sh/>
         
         <line/>don, and as many more at other ports, which are pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>paring to sail for the settlement with passengers. In<sh/>
         
         <line/>deed the numbers who are flying from the country at 
         <line/>this moment who are, we believe, quite unprecedented. 
         <line/>Within the last ten days we have seen notices of fifteen 
         <line/>ships that were loading with emigrants at Hull, twelve 
         <line/>at Waterford, and several at Bristol, Liverpool, and 
         <column/>
         <line/>Greenock, all destined, we think, for the United States, 
         <line/>or British America. The exportation of human beings 
         <line/>from the British Isles, to different quarters of the 
         <line/>world, must now be proceeding at the rate of one or 
         <line/>two thousand per week. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It will be remembered, that according to reports 
         <line/>from India received some time ago, Lord William 
         <line/>Bentick had issued an order, abolishing those horrid 
         <line/>human sacrifices, the <i>Suttees</i>. Doubts were thrown 
         <line/>upon this intelligence when the subject was lately 
         <line/>talked of in Parliament ; but we are happy to say, that 
         <line/>its accuracy is confirmed by the arrival of the official 
         <line/>document. It is disgraceful to the British Indian Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernment, that it has been hitherto either so callous, 
         <line/>that it overlooked this enormity, or so ignorant of its 
         <line/>own resources, and the true state of the people under 
         <line/>its authority, as to believe that it had not power to 
         <line/>effect its abolition. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The report of a revolution having taken place in 
         <line/>Chili, is confirmed in letters from Bogota. The 
         <line/>constitutional Director, Pinto, has been driven out of 
         <line/>the capital by General Prieto with an armed force, and 
         <line/>great excesses are said to have been committed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A small fleet sailed lately from Cadiz for Havannah, 
         <line/>with 2000 soldiers on board. The expedition is sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed by some to be intended for the invasion of 
         <line/>Mexico ; but it is more likely to find employment in 
         <line/>keeping down the elements of insurrection in Cuba– 
         <line/>The plot to which we alluded in our last, seems to have 
         <line/>excited much alarm. Some of the most opulent fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>milies in the island, with several lawyers and official 
         <line/>persons, were concerned in it. Their object was, as we 
         <line/>conjectured, to convert the island into an independent 
         <line/>republic. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From a detailed list published in the French papers, 
         <line/>it appears that the expedition against Algiers is to be 
         <line/>composed of 34,000 men, infantry, cavalray, and artil<sh/>
         
         <line/>lery. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Farther intelligence has been received from the ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>pital of Colombia to the 14th of February. A warm 
         <line/>address had been presented by the Congress to Bolivar, 
         <line/>entreating him not to abandon the republic at a mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment when its existence was menaced by conspiracies; 
         <line/>and he seems to have once more consented to remain 
         <line/>in office. Commissioners had been appointed to pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceed to Valentia, and endeavour to accomodate the 
         <line/>differences between the people of Venezuela and the 
         <line/>central government, by peaceable means. If these 
         <line/>failed it was determined to employ force. The Congress 
         <line/>was in session at Bogota, and was proceeding to fulfil the 
         <line/>object for which it had been assembled, by drawing up 
         <line/>a new constitution. The bases are published, and though 
         <line/>the present only an imperfect sketch of its plan, 
         <line/>they disclose one or two features which seem to be cha<sh/>
         
         <line/>racteristic. The government is to be <i>central</i>, as it has 
         <line/>hitherto been, not <i>federal</i> like that of the United States, 
         <line/>which has served as a model to Mexico, Guatemala, 
         <line/>and La Plata. In the one case the supreme authority 
         <line/>is vested in a single legislature, which meets in the ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>pital ; in the other it is divided among a number of 
         <line/>local assemblies, while the general congress represent<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the whole, wields no other powers than what is ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>cessary to hold the separate members in a state of 
         <line/>union. The federal system, which leaves to every pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>vince the management of its own conerns, has ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vantages for a settled and enlightened community ; but 
         <line/>whether it is equally adapted to the circumstances of 
         <line/>an ignorant people newly escaped from political con<sh/>
         
         <line/>vulsions, is very questionable. There seems, how<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever, to be a partiality for the federal system in the 
         <line/>new world ; and to humour this feeling, the new con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stitution provides, that "Chambers of Distrcits" shall 
         <line/>be established, with powers to decide on all municipal 
         <line/>and local affairs. The difficulty will be, to give these 
         <line/>bodies the powers necessary to develope the industry 
         <line/>and resources of the country, without permitting them 
         <line/>to impose taxes, and exercise other legislative functions, 
         <line/>which will interfere with the business of the general 
         <line/>government. Another articl state, that the members 
         <line/>of the Senate and House of Representatives are to hold 
         <line/>their seats for a considerable time, in order " to avoid 
         <line/>the inconveniences resulting from frequent changes, or 
         <line/>the repeated election of the same person." In the 
         <line/>mouth of an English statesman, we should consider 
         <line/>this vile sophistry ; but allowance must be made 
         <line/>for the <i>res durƏ novitas regni</i>, in a new 
         <line/>state like Colombia, formed of heterogenous ele<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments, among which it is not easy to establish 
         <line/>any principle of cohesion. One the same grouns, the 
         <line/>Columbian legislators may be pardoned for resolving 
         <line/>that the Catholic religion is that of the state, and that 
         <line/>no other shall be permitted. This is merely a conces<sh/>
         
         <line/>cession for the sake of peace, to prejudice which the 
         <line/>government is not strong enough to subdue, and can<sh/>
         
         <line/>not defy without great danger. Nothing is said about 
         <line/>the mode of election, or the power of the Presiden, two 
         <line/>points of vital consequence, which may give a new 
         <line/>complexion to the whole scheme. We have made 
         <line/>these remarks on the proposed constitution, because it 
         <line/>probably holds out the last chance of composing the 
         <line/>trouble of Columbia. If it does not satisfy the people 
         <line/>other provinces will soon follow the example of Vene<sh/>
         
         <line/>zuela, and all the address and influence of Bolivar will 
         <line/>not prevent the republic from splitting into four or 
         <line/>five independent communities, whose mutual jealousness 
         <line/>and wars will crush the librties, and destroy the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>sperity of the whole.

            <i>The Wool Trade.–London, Thursday Night.–</i>
         
         <line/>This afternoon the first sale of wools for a long time 
         <line/>past took place at Garraway's Coffee-house. The 
         <line/>quantity announced for sale to-day was nearly 200 bales, 
         <line/>consisting of about 100 bales of New South Wales 
         <line/>wool, 50 bales of Van Dieman's Land wools, &amp;c. The 
         <line/>New South Wales wool was first put up and went off 
         <line/>very briskly at prices averaging from 1s 4 1/2d to 1s 10d 
         <line/>per lb., which quotations are higher than those last 
         <line/>obtained. The Van Dieman's Land wools were sold 
         <line/>by order of the Van Dieman's Land Company, being 
         <line/>a portion of the last arrivals from the Company's flocks. 
         <line/>They met a very ready sale, and the average prices ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained were from 1s 5d to 2s 1d per lb. The arrivals 
         <line/>from Germany and other places this year are expected 
         <line/>to be very great.

         <line/>THE EQUALITY OF SEXES.–The <i>Examiner</i> of Sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>turday las has some witty remarks on the plaint which 
         <line/>appeared in our paper on the excess of females over 
         <line/>males in the census, which he assures us is entirely 
         <line/>owing to the lives of females being prolonged by their 
         <line/>better regularity. This is a sly censure upon the ha<sh/>
         
         <line/>bit of our countrymen, one-fifth, or sixth part of whom 
         <line/>we were supposed by implication to be cut off perma<sh/>
         
         <line/>nently by intemperance! We admit that a few hearty 
         <line/>fellows do go off in apoplexy; but we deny that the 
         <line/>number bears any proportion to the amount supposed; 
         <line/>we have two other remarks to make on his state<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. First, since our manners were corrupted by im<sh/>
         
         <line/>itating <i>English</i> fashions, it is whispered, we hope un<sh/>
         
         <line/>, that there are such things as tippling women in 
         <line/>country, some of whom do disappear suddenly–no 
         <line/>matter how; and secondly, we wish our London friend 
         <line/>inform us how it happens, that while all Broad 
         <line/>England has only an excess of 11 1/2 per cent females,

            <i>The Machine Breakers.</i>–A convict ship at Ports<sh/>
         
         <line/>mouth is on the point of sailing for Van Diemen's 
         <line/>Land, with between two and three hundred convicts on 
         <line/>board, who have been lately convicted for machine<sh/>
         
         <line/> breaking, extorting money, and other offences com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted in the disturbed counties. Another ship, with 
         <line/>convicts of the same description, will be dispatched for 
         <line/>New South Wales, in about a fortnight. These con<sh/>
         
         <line/>victs have been kept entirely separate from all other 
         <line/>prisoners, and an accurate report will be made to the 
         <line/>Governors of the Colonies, as to their former character, 
         <line/>their trades and employments, and the recommenda<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions which have been made in their favour subsequent<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly to their trials. The capital convicts whose lives 
         <line/>have been spared, are to be transported for life; and 
         <line/>the convicts, sentenced and recommended by the Judges 
         <line/>for transportation, are to be transported according to 
         <line/>their respective sentences.

         <line/>Botany Bay serves as a recipient for criminals whose 
         <line/>reformation is hopeless, and whom it is therefore desir<sh/>
         
         <line/>able to remove from the Society to whose peace and se<sh/>
         
         <line/>curity they are sworn enemies. This is the sole value 
         <line/>of the colony. If it did not exist, recourse would be 
         <line/>had more frequently to perpetual imprisonment and the 
         <line/>gibbet. Experience shews, however, that transportation 
         <line/>does not produce the intended effect of terrifying the 
         <line/>guilty. Its monitory operation depends greatly on the 
         <line/>situation of the criminal. "Agricultural labourers 
         <line/>with families dread it extremely, while to single men, 
         <line/>mechanics who are sure of receiving high wages, and 
         <line/>generally to all those who feel a desire of change, and a 
         <line/>vague expectation of pushing their fortunes, it appears 
         <line/>to hold out no terrors whatever." In the colony there 
         <line/>is a competition among settlers to obtain convinct 
         <line/>servants, and those who get them, endeavour, from 
         <line/>a regard to their own interest to render the situation 
         <line/>of the convicts as little irksome as possible. The 
         <line/>evidence proves, that when the feeling degrada<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion is once overcome, the situation of the Australian 
         <line/>convict "is, in many respects, preferable to that of 
         <line/>the agricultural labourer in this country :" He 
         <line/>has better clothing, more abundant food, and en<sh/>
         
         <line/>joys a finer climate. The hardship, too, of compulsory 
         <line/>labour is but for a limited time. The convict who is 
         <line/>transported for 7 years, is allowed a Ticket of Leave, 
         <line/>at the end of 8years. Once possessed of this 
         <line/>ticket he is allowed to work on his own account, and 
         <line/>with high wages, easily acquires capital. The com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mittee see little chance of rendering punishment effec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive in the colony. They recommend various subordi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nate regulations, and among others, they suggest as a 
         <line/>remedy for the great expense attending transportation, 
         <line/>that no convict be assigned to a settler until he shall 
         <line/>have paid, or given security for the payment by instal<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments, of the expense incurred in the conveyance of 
         <line/>the convict from the mother country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We are satisfied that the true check to the increase 
         <line/>of crime is to be found, first, in the diffusion of educa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion and sound knowledge ; and, second, in the improve<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of our judicial and municipal institutions. Law, 
         <line/>in all its important branches, should be dispensed by 
         <line/>paid and responsible persons. A judge ought to 
         <line/>be stationed in each small district, and keep open 
         <line/>court every day of the year. He should be chosen 
         <line/>by some popular constituency, which would faithfully 
         <line/>represent the feelings of the mass of suitors; and 
         <line/>as a guarantee for his diligence, he should hold his 
         <line/>office only for seven years, and be re-eligible. Jus<sh/>
         
         <line/>tices of Peace, if retained at all, should be elected 
         <line/>as in most of the American states, by the householders 
         <line/>for three, four, or seven years. Jails also, should be 
         <line/>placed under the controul of popular bodies, and thrown 
         <line/>open to the improving efforts of private benevolence. 
         <line/>In this, as in other points, we have much to learn from 
         <line/>the Americans, who never forget that the criminal is still 
         <line/>a man. The grand defect in our legislation has been, 
         <line/>that the rich made laws for the poor, of whose situation 
         <line/>they had scarcely any knowledge, and with whose feel<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings, wants, and moral condition, they had of course no 
         <line/>sympathy. The unpaid Magistracy of Britain is a bar<sh/>
         
         <line/>barism belonging to the tenth century. Thirty years 
         <line/>hence men will wonder how their forefathers tolerated 
         <line/>so monstrous a system.

            <i>Wool</i>–The accounts received in Lond from New 
         <line/>South Wales to the 8th of January, state that the produce 
         <line/>of the last year's clip of wool in Australia will be greatest 
         <line/>than that of the preceding year, and the the quali<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty has also considerably improved. From Van Die<sh/>
         
         <line/>man's Land it is now ascertained that the supply this 
         <line/>year will be short, but the general quality is very supe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rior. In the course of about a week or ten days, large 
         <line/>arrivals of wool are looked for from New South Wales 
         <line/>and the private contract business is expected to be very 
         <line/>active. The public sales of wools went off on Friday 
         <line/>very well, and at full prices. The arrivals of this week 
         <line/>have consisted of about 708 bales, of which about 292 
         <line/>bales were Van Dieman's Land wools, and the rest Ger<sh/>
         
         <line/>man. There is a steady demand, and as it is under<sh/>
         
         <line/>stood that the manufacturers are short of stock, the an<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticipations are that trade will son be greatly improved.

            <i>York Wool Market, May</i> 23.–The market com<sh/>
         
         <line/>menced here for this season this day, with only a small 
         <line/>show of wool, and not many buyers. The holders ask<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing very high prices caused part to be left unsold. 
         <line/>The following are the prices ; Hogs from 18s to 19s ; 
         <line/>Hogs and Ewes 16s 6d to 17s 6d ; Locks 11s to 
         <line/>12s, 6d per stone of 16lbs.

         <line/>
            <i>Bradford Market</i>–The supply of Merinos in the 
         <line/>markets on Thursday evening, was by no means equal 
         <line/>to the demand–all qualities in six quarter wide Me<sh/>
         
         <line/>rinoes were eagerly bought up, and in some instances 
         <line/>a farther advance was obtained ; three quarter wide 
         <line/>Merinoes run much in demand, but a very scanty sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>ply ; the advance on six quarter wide Merinoes is from 
         <line/>4s to 6s per piece, compared with what was given at 
         <line/>the beginning of the year, and three quarter wide are 
         <line/>proportionably higher. Unless a reduction takes place 
         <line/>in the price of wool, the manufacturers state they must 
         <line/>have a further advance. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <i>Rochdale Flannel Market.</i>–The market today was 
         <line/>very lively for this season of the yar ; low goods both 
         <line/>for white and for dyeing were of very ready sale, and 
         <line/>in some instances a little advance was obtained ; several 
         <line/>sales were effected in fine qualities, and if the demand 
         <line/>proves permanent, the prospect for the coming season is 
         <line/>very promising. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <i>Liverpool Cotton Market.</i>–There has been but a 
         <line/>limited inquiry for cotton during the week ; the sales 
         <line/>are only about 10,000 bugs, at declining prices.

            <i>The Wool Trade.</i>–The whole of the London public 
         <line/>sales of Colonial and other woold having now been 
         <line/>gone through, the wool trade is in a more settled state, 
         <line/>and transactions by private contract are conducted on a 
         <line/>more extensive scale. The total amount of the late 
         <line/>sales, the last of which took place on Tuesday, was 
         <line/>4,000 bales, and the colonial wools were taken by the 
         <line/>manufactures at the extreme advance realized at the 
         <line/>previous sales in July. In some cases, indeed, quota<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions from 2d to 3d per lb. in advance were obtained. 
         <line/>The sales on Saturday was most fully attended, and in<sh/>
         
         <line/>creased boldness was observed. The colonial wools 
         <line/>offered on that day fetched excellent prices. Some few 
         <line/>bales were also offered, forming a part of the second 
         <line/>clip of wools in the new colony on the Swan River. 
         <line/>They were much better in quality than those last re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceived. Some German lambs' wool also commanded 
         <line/>attention, and sold as high as 3s 10d to 4s per lb. The 
         <line/>sale on Tuesday (the last of the series,) was not quite 
         <line/>so fully attended as those of last wekk, but, according 
         <line/>to quality, full prices were obtained. The sale consisted 
         <line/>of 437 bales New South Wales and Van Diemen's 
         <line/>Land wool, 96 bales of Portugal wool, 54 Spanish, and 
         <line/>72 bales of Cape, German, Russian, and other wools. 
         <line/>The best fleece of Amsterdam offered fetched 2s 10d to 
         <line/>3s 2d, and seconds 2s 3d to 2s 7 1/2d per lb ; the 
         <line/>best Portugal 1s 2d to 1s 11d ; the best Spanish 2s 5d 
         <line/>to 2s 8d ; the best Cape 1s 4d to 1s 8d ; the best Van 
         <line/>Diemen's Land 1s 8d to 1s 10d ; and the best German 
         <line/>2s to 2s 3d per lb. The result of these sales is to esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blish a much firmer market for wools of all descriptions 
         <line/>than previously existed. The arrivals of wool are 
         <line/>limited, and this week only 575 bales of German wool, 
         <line/>and abotu 375 bales of Neapolitan wool have been en<sh/>
         
         <line/>tered at the custom house.

            <enlarged_capital>T</enlarged_capital>he subject of emigration is rising in importance 
         <line/>from year to year, and cannot lose its interest as long 
         <line/>as much misery or much discontent exists among our 
         <line/>working classes. Upper Canada, the great recipient of 
         <line/>our surplus population, is 4000 miles from Britain, a 
         <line/>distance which looks extremely formidable ; but such 
         <line/>is the amazing economy of water carriage, when se<sh/>
         
         <line/>conded by good arrangements, that the voyage by sea 
         <line/>to Montreal can be made at as small expense as the 
         <line/>journey by land to Manchester ! The passage money 
         <line/>from Dublin to Montreal or Quebec (exclusive of food) 
         <line/>has been as low as 30s ; and it would not be higher 
         <line/>probably from Leith or Greenock, if the emigrants 
         <line/>were in sufficient numbers, and so prompt in their ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rangements, that the vessel lost no time beyond what 
         <line/>was strictly necessary for taking her full compliment 
         <line/>aboard. If the ship is detained a month before this is 
         <line/>got, the owners must, of course, be indemnified for the 
         <line/>detention by a higher fare. Four stone of oatmeal, 
         <line/>with a little ham or salt fish for variety, will subsist a 
         <line/>man or woman on the voyage ; and thus a human be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing can be conveyed over a distance equal to one-sixth 
         <line/>part of the circumference of the globe, and six times 
         <line/>longer, we dare say, than the wanderings of Ulysses, at 
         <line/>the small coast of 45s ! 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In an article in May 1832, we pointed out the rapid 
         <line/>strides with which emigration was advancing ; and 
         <line/>some Parliamentary papers we have received since, ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>hibit new proofs of its extraordinary progress. It 
         <line/>has, in fact, outstripped the expectations of the most 
         <line/>sanguine.

         <line/>The following table shows the number of person who 
         <line/>have emigrated in the last eight years to North America,

         <line/>It will be seen from this table how steady the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>crease of emigration has been, especially to Canada. 
         <line/>It must be observed, that a great proportion, probably 
         <line/>more than a half of those who sailed for the United 
         <line/>States, were destined for the British colonies, and only 
         <line/>chose that route as the most eligible, on account of the 
         <line/>facilities which the Hudson and its associated canals 
         <line/>present for travelling to the upper province. Canada 
         <line/>and Nova Scotia must have drawn at least 80,000 set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlers from Britain last year ; and yet, such are the ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>pacities of these colonies for absorbing population, that 
         <line/>the price of labour was not lowered in the least degree ; 
         <line/>and from the previous arrangements made, it is an<sh/>
         
         <line/>nounced that a much larger number of persons could 
         <line/>have been received without inconvenience ! Sanguine 
         <line/>as we were upon the subject, we did not anticipate that 
         <line/>emigration could be conducted on such a scale, with 
         <line/>the extraordinary ease, certainty, and economy now ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>emplified. Those who reflect on the distress and 
         <line/>perplexity which would be produced by land<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the <i>sixth-part</i> of eighty thousand strangers on 
         <line/>the shores of Britain in one summer, will appreciate 
         <line/>the extremely dissimilar condition of a colony which, 
         <line/>with less than a million inhabitants, can take in 
         <line/>eighty-thousand new settlers in the same period without 
         <line/>embarassment or confusion. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The general result is, that Britain sent off 103,000 
         <line/>souls from her population last year, of whom a[?] number 
         <line/>sailed 7000 miles, a number 14,000, and those who 
         <line/>made the shortest voyage, 4000 miles. The annals of 
         <line/>emigration afford nothing approaching to this in any 
         <line/>part of the world ; and yet we may reasonably expect to 
         <line/>see still greater things atcheived. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It appears from the various census since 1801, that 
         <line/>the annual increase in Britain, if no persons left it, 
         <line/>would be about 350,000; or we may place the fact in 
         <line/>a more striking light by stating, that <i>there are about a</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>thousand persons more in the three kingdoms every</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>day than there was on the day before</i>. If by raising 
         <line/>the habits and ideas of the labouring classes, we could 
         <line/>get this daily increase reduced one half, and the 
         <line/>other half could be carried off by emigration–if we 
         <line/>could by this means keep the supply of labour station<sh/>
         
         <line/>ary while capital was increasing, a great improvement 
         <line/>would be effected in the state of the population. Now 
         <line/>from what has been stated it appears that the emigrants 
         <line/>who leave our shores annually amount to nearly one<sh/>
         
         <line/> third of the annual excess already ; and in a year or 
         <line/>two there is every probability that it will amount to 
         <line/>one-half. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Of 51,200 emigrants who landed at Quebec and 
         <line/>Montreal last year, 17,500 went from England, 
         <line/>28,200 from Ireland, and 5,500 from Scotland. In 
         <line/>the year 1831, the numbers were, from England 10,300, 
         <line/>Ireland 34,100, Scotland 5,300. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Of the emigrants from Scotland last year, 1716 sail<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed from Greenock, 1145 from Leith, 638 from Cro<sh/>
         
         <line/>marty, 478 from Aberdeen, 439 from Dundee, 231 
         <line/>from Alloa, 181 from Islay, 175 from Anna, 160 from 
         <line/>Glasgow, 112 from Leven, 110 from Campbeltown, 
         <line/>and numbers under 100 from Stanraer, Peterhead, and 
         <line/>Irvine. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Of the emigrants to the United States last year 
         <line/>15,754 sailed from Liverpool, 5,546 from London 
         <line/>2,742 from Bristol, 2,613 from Londonderry, and 
         <line/>1,711 from Greenock. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Buchanan, the Government agent at Quebec, 
         <line/>states in his Report, that "the general description of 
         <line/>emigrants who arrived last year ; many respectable and wealthy fa<sh/>
         
         <line/>milies came from all part of the united kingdom ; and 
         <line/>the extent of property and specie brought into the 
         <line/>country by them is exceedingly great, fully amounting 
         <line/>to from &#x163;600,000 to &#x163;700,000 sterling." About 5000 
         <line/>persons were sent out by pecuniary aid from parishes 
         <line/>or landlords ; and there were 1700 "commuted pen<sh/>
         
         <line/>sioners" (military, we believe), many of them men of 
         <line/>irregular habits, and ill fitted for the situation of set<sh/>
         
         <line/>tlers. Of these, about 100 returned to Britain. The 
         <line/>fear of cholera was a considerable check to emigration. 
         <line/>It appeared in Quebec on the 8th of June, and the 
         <line/>persons who arrived after that, suffered much from 
         <line/>the difficulty of procuring lodgings even for a day ; 
         <line/>but Mr Buchanan estimates the whole number of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grants who fell victims to the disease, at no more than 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The demand for all classes of working people 
         <line/>(says the Report,) has never been exceeded in the Ca<sh/>
         
         <line/>nadas, particularly since the abatement of the cholera, 
         <line/>and I can assure your Lordship that, during my late 
         <line/>tour through the districts and settlements of Upper 
         <line/>Canada, I did not see an industrious emigrant who 
         <line/>could not meet with emplyment. The number of 
         <line/>that class arrived this year is not adequate to supply 
         <line/>the demand created by the more wealthy emigrants. 
         <line/>This was particularly felt in the Western and London 
         <line/>districts of the upper province, where the want of la<sh/>
         
         <line/>bourers was so great that it was found necessary to en<sh/>
         
         <line/>courage a number to come over from Ohio and Pen<sh/>
         
         <line/>nsylvania." This was written on the 12th Dec. 1832, 
         <line/>and the arrival of emigrants closed in October.

         <line/>The following document has just been issued from the 
         <line/>Colonial Office:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Downing street, April 6, 1834. 
         <line/>Numerous applicants have been received from per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons desirous of emigrating to New South Wales or Van 
         <line/>Dieman's Land, who, after stating their inability to de<sh/>
         
         <line/>fray the whole charge of their conveyance, solicit aid 
         <line/>for that purpose, on condition of repaying the same out 
         <line/>of their earnings in the colony where they propose to 
         <line/>settle. His Majesty's government has sanctioned the 
         <line/>appropriate of a limited sum out of the colonial reve<sh/>
         
         <line/>nues of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, to 
         <line/>assist the private funds of such emigrants as may ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pear likely to earn the means of repayig that aid, and 
         <line/>to become useful settlers. The following are the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>gulations under which this induglence will be dispens<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>No advance will be made except to young and mar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ried agricultural labourers, who intend taking their 
         <line/>wives and families with them : and a strict inquiry will 
         <line/>be instituted into their character and habits of industry, 
         <line/>before the assistance they solicit will be granted to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>No one family will be allowed an advance exceeding 
         <line/>&#x163;20; and it will be useful therefore for parties, who 
         <line/>may not possess the remainder of the sum requisite for 
         <line/>defraying the expense of their passage, to apply for as<sh/>
         
         <line/>sistance. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Every person desirous of receiving the proposed ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vance must fill up, and send back to the Under Secre<sh/>
         
         <line/>tary of State for the Colonial Department, the return 
         <line/>hereto annexed. If the information contained in this 
         <line/>return, and the answers to the inquiries which may be 
         <line/>addressed to the parties who certify the correctness of 
         <line/>the return, shall be considered satisfactory, the appli<sh/>
         
         <line/>cant will receive notice to that effect. He may then 
         <line/>proceed to make his agreement with the owners or 
         <line/>masters of ships proceeding to New South Wales or 
         <line/>Van Diemen's land, and as soon as any ship-owner 
         <line/>or master shall notify (in a form which will be provided 
         <line/>for that purpose) that the emigrant has taken the other 
         <line/>necessary steps for engaging his passage, and order will 
         <line/>be granted for the payment in the colony, of &#x163;20 to the 
         <line/>agent or master of the vessel in which this emigrant 
         <line/>may arrive. The emigrant will of course be able to[?] ob-[?] 
         <line/>tain a corresponding deduction from the amount[?] [?] 
         <line/>paid by himself in this country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The order for payment will be entrusted [?] 
         <line/>ter of the vessel in which the emigrants to pro[?] 
         <line/>and will consist of a sealed dispatch to the governor, 
         <line/>containing the name and description of the party on 
         <line/>whose account the money is to be paid, and encolosing a 
         <line/>promissory note, which he will be required to sign in 
         <line/>acknowledgement of his debt ; which note must be wit<sh/>
         
         <line/>nessed by the captain and chief mate of the vessel. But 
         <line/>arrangements will be made, by which the payment of 
         <line/>this order will not take place in the colony until the 
         <line/>captain shall have produced the parties, on whose ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>count it is to be made, before the officer appointed for 
         <line/>that purpose, and they shall have entered into a fresh 
         <line/>obligation for the repayment of the advance made to 
         <line/>them. For it is the intention of his Majesty's Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, and cannot be too clearly understoof by all per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons who may accept this loan, that repayments of the 
         <line/>debt (in such proportions and at such intervals as may 
         <line/>not be unsuitable to the circumstances of each emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grant) shall be strictly enforced, by means of the ample 
         <line/>powers which the laws of the colony render available 
         <line/>for that purpose. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Government agents for emigration have been appoint<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed at Liverpool, Bristol, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Bel<sh/>
         
         <line/>fast, and Greenock, who have been instructed to afford 
         <line/>gratuitous information to all persons applying to them 
         <line/>as to the best means of carrying their schemes of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration into effect. Parties, therefore, who may reside 
         <line/>in the neighbourhood of these agents are requested to 
         <line/>apply to them either personally (or if by letter post 
         <line/>paid) for information on this subject.

      <p>
         <line/>All application for the assistance of government must

         <line/>A meeting of the members of the South Australian Asso<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciation was held on Monday, at Exeter Hall, "for the pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose of explaining the principles, objects, plan, and prospects 
         <line/>of a new colony," proposed to be founded in South Australia. 
         <line/>Mr W. Whitmore in the chair. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Upon taking the chair, Mr Whitmore stated, that the first 
         <line/>question which the meeting would have to consider would be 
         <line/>this–whether there existed or not at present any necessity 
         <line/>for a more extended system of colonization. It appeared to 
         <line/>him that there was a great defect in our present system of 
         <line/>colonication, and that it would be greatly to our advantage if 
         <line/>we established it upon a new principle, well and seriously 
         <line/>considered. That which struck him as the greatest defect 
         <line/>was, that we did not provided that colonization which in<sh/>
         
         <line/>cluded within it members of all classes of society. Large 
         <line/>numbers of emigrants went out with capital, but not carry<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing with them that number of the lower class which was 
         <line/>necessary to employ their capital to advantage. In other 
         <line/>cases, perhaps almost as numerous, the labourer went out 
         <line/>without capital which was necessry to enable him to employ 
         <line/>his labour to advantage. This was a striking defect. Now 
         <line/>the question which they were then called upon to consider, 
         <line/>regarded the best means of remedying that defect. Those 
         <line/>means, it appeared to him, were quite practicable, and might 
         <line/>be accomplished in this manner, vz. by establishing as a sys<sh/>
         
         <line/>tem that all the waste lands which they were about to colo<sh/>
         
         <line/>nize should be sold at a given price, such as the market would 
         <line/>command, and that the proceeds of such sales should be 
         <line/>employed in sending out to the colonies a sufficient number 
         <line/>of labourers to cultivate the lands so sold. If this system 
         <line/>could be carried into effect, he apprehended that all the evils 
         <line/>of our present system of colonization would be removed, and 
         <line/>that we should be enabled to transplant a portion of the com<sh/>
         
         <line/>munity of the mother country with all its various grades into 
         <line/>the new country which they now proposed to coloniz. He 
         <line/>believed that if we proceeded upon this principle, we should 
         <line/>lay the foundation of the greatest colony which England had 
         <line/>ever settled. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Grote, M.P., moved the first resolution,–"That the 
         <line/>wealth and prosperity of this country have been greatly pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>moted by the establishment of British colonies in various 
         <line/>parts of the world, and that colonization, when conducted 
         <line/>systematically and upon sound principles, offers the means of 
         <line/>extending indefinitely the commercial empire of the united 
         <line/>kingdom, and the field of employment for British capital and 
         <line/>labour." He would not enter into the recommendations 
         <line/>which this undertaking offered to all classes of the communi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ty ; but he would venture to state, that to any gentleman 
         <line/>who considered the prospectus which had been put out by the 
         <line/>association, and who recollected that it was a matter of cer<sh/>
         
         <line/>tainty that the land in the colony was to be used as the means 
         <line/>of raising a fund to carry over thither the labour, which was 
         <line/>superabundant here, it must be evident that from this impor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tant innovation on our colonial system great benefit must be 
         <line/>derived[?] both to the new colony and to the mother country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Clay, M.P., in seocnding the resolution, entered at 
         <line/>great length into the difficulty of finding employment, which 
         <line/>now prevails in all parts of the community, and then, after 
         <line/>condemning the corn laws, continued thus–Colonization, if 
         <line/>carried on to a considerable extent, would as effectually add 
         <line/>millions of fertile acres to our shores as if the Irish sea were 
         <line/>filled up with fertile land. If that miracle took place is it 
         <line/>not clear that all distress would immediately cease, and that 
         <line/>the emplyment which the addition of so many fertile acres 
         <line/>would afford must give a new stimulus to the prosperity of 
         <line/>the country ? Is it not clear that the miserable compotation[?] 
         <line/>for potato-gardens in Ireland would cease, and that the diffi<sh/>
         
         <line/>culties flowing from an unemployed population would cease ? 
         <line/>Does any man doubt that it would be well worth the while of 
         <line/>our capitalists to take such land at from 10s to 20s an acre. 
         <line/>(Hear.) Yet this plan is in effect the same as if the land were 
         <line/>added to our own island, because, if this plan of colonization 
         <line/>be adopted, a transplantation of a sufficiency of labourers, 
         <line/>now wanting employment, from this country, for its culture, 
         <line/>will take place, which is equivalent to the transportation of 
         <line/>the land to the labourer. In point of fact, the ocean joins 
         <line/>these distant lands, instead of separating them. (Hear.)– 
         <line/>There can be no doubt but that a wider comercial code, and 
         <line/>the removal of restrictions on labour, would greatly facilitate, 
         <line/>extend, and increase the commercial intercourse between the 
         <line/>old nation of the world ; but in no case would the increase 
         <line/>be in proportion to that which might be calculated on, as the 
         <line/>consequence of a connection with newly-formed countries in 
         <line/>other climates. As regards the establishment of colonies, it 
         <line/>is virtually an extension of the mother country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Colonel Torrens, M.P., proposed the second resolution– 
         <line/>"That in establishing colonies, great care ought to be taken 
         <line/>to combine labour and capital with land, in such propor<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions as are best calculated to insure the prosperity of all 
         <line/>classes of society, and that, in establishing modern colonies, 
         <line/>this important consideration has been so generally overlook<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed." It was, he said, almost unnecessary for him to state that 
         <line/>in all systems of colonization, land, labour, and capital, ought 
         <line/>to be combinedin just proportions ; and yet this simple prin<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciple had been hitherto greatly neglected by those who had 
         <line/>led new colonies from the mother country. In the first place, 
         <line/>the whole of the land of this colony was to be public land. 
         <line/>No individual was to obtain a single acre by gift. There was 
         <line/>to be no patronage, no job–all were to be on a footing of 
         <line/>equality, and nobody was to have a single inch of land for 
         <line/>nothing. There would also be another advantage in this sys<sh/>
         
         <line/>tem, which would arise in the following :–In other co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonies, the labourer who had gone out and found that he could 
         <line/>get land for nothing, had often fallen into the mistake that 
         <line/>land was wealth, instead of it being merely the means of 
         <line/>producing wealth. That fatal mistake had often led him to 
         <line/>refuse the work of the master with whom he had gone out, 
         <line/>and set up for himself as an independent landowner. He had 
         <line/>in consequence set up, where he was far away from the mar<sh/>
         
         <line/>ket of the colony, where he had no roads over which to convey 
         <line/>his produce, and where he had perished miserably. But in 
         <line/>this colony the labourers would be compelled for some time 
         <line/>to work for hire. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Guest, M.P. seconded the resolution. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Hutt, M.P. moved the third resolution to the following 
         <line/>effect:–"That in order to promote the greatest prosperity of 
         <line/>a new colony, it is expedient that all waste land, without any 
         <line/>exception, shall be declared public land, and be disposed of to 
         <line/>individuals by sale only, and according to an uniform, impar<sh/>
         
         <line/>tial, and permanent system."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Captain Gowan seconded the resolution, and spoke in the 
         <line/>highest terms of the salubrity of the climate of Australia. 
         <line/>Many of his fellow soldiers in India had gone there for the 
         <line/>recovery of their health, and had found something so tem<sh/>
         
         <line/>perate and soothing in the country, that they had retired 
         <line/>there altogeher, preferring its mild and gentle breeze to the 
         <line/>chills of their native country, England. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr P. Scrope, M.P. moved "That it is also desirable that 
         <line/>the whole of the purchase money of public land, without any 
         <line/>deduction, should be employed in providing a free passage 
         <line/>from the mother country to the colony, of young adult per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons of the labouring class, who may be willing to emigrate, 
         <line/>and in equal proportion of both sexes." As the want of 
         <line/>labour was the great difficulty in all infant colonies, the 
         <line/>more labour they imported, the greater labour did they give 
         <line/>their land ; the more they got for the sale of it, the greater 
         <line/>was their power of importing fresh labour. This resolution, 
         <line/>therefore, acted in a reciprocal manner upon itself, and when 
         <line/>it was once fairly put into operation they would proceed on<sh/>
         
         <line/>wards on the road to prosperity with accelerated velocity, 
         <line/>meeting with no other obstacle than the unwillingness of 
         <line/>England to part with her inhabitants. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Wilks, M.P. seconded the resolution. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Handson moved –"That amongst the unoccupied por<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions of the earth which form part of the British dominions, 
         <line/>the south coast of Australia appears to be a sport peculiarly 
         <line/>suitable for founding a colony upon the principles embodied 
         <line/>in the preceding resolutions." The place where this colony
         <line/>was to be founded was one distinguished from every other 
         <line/>part of Australia, from its possessing a facility of internal 
         <line/>communications prior even to the formation of roads, and 
         <line/>the soil would amply repay the labour expended on its culti<sh/>
         
         <line/>vation. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Robert Owen (not of Lanark) said that the coasts of 
         <line/>this colony abounded with whales, and that its whale fishe<sh/>
         
         <line/>ries might become valuable. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr M. D. Hill rose to propose the resolution embodying the 
         <line/>mode of carrying the principles of this association into effect. 
         <line/>No colony could go on without some law. He did not care 
         <line/>how little they had of it, provided they made up in quality 
         <line/>what was deficient in quantity. The hon. member entered 
         <line/>into an elaborate description of the laws intended to be enact<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed for the colony, and concluded by moving–"That the 
         <line/>provisions for the peace, order, and good government of the 
         <line/>British Province of South Australia, as contained in the bill 
         <line/>now before Parliament, are highly satisfactory."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr D. Wakefield seconded the resolution. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Sir W. Molesworth, M.P. proposed, and Mr Childers, M.P., 
         <line/>seconded the following resolution :–"That it is the opinion 
         <line/>of this meeting that the thanks of the country are due to Mr 
         <line/>Spring Rice for his prompt and enlightened conduct in pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>moting the beneficial public object of the South Australian 
         <line/>Association."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The resolutions were carried unanimously. Thanks were 
         <line/>given to the Chairman, and the meeting, at which many 
         <line/>ladies were present, broke up. The proceedings lasted from 
         <line/>twelve o'clock to a quarter before five.

         <line/>On the order of the day for the third reading of the Univer<sh/>

      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Herriks[?]</small_caps> took the occasion of calling on Government to 
         <line/>explain the circumstances which had occurred in certain 
         <line/>transactions between the Board of Controul and the East India 
         <line/>directors. These transactions, the hon. gentleman stated, to 
         <line/>be the repeated peremptory commands of the Board of Con<sh/>
         
         <line/>troul to the Directors of the East India Company to prepare 
         <line/>a despatch for the purpose of directing the Indian Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment to compel the King of Oude, to pay certain claims made 
         <line/>on him on behalf of Calcutta bankers, which commands the 
         <line/>Court of Directors refused to obey, on the ground that the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>terference which the Board of Controul required them to ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>ercise with the King of Oude, was inconsistent with the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>lations subsisting between the British Government and the 
         <line/>King of Oude, and would be most mischievous in effect. On 
         <line/>the 31st of January the right jon. gentleman had appliedfor, 
         <line/>and obtained a rule to show cause why, under the act of Par<sh/>
         
         <line/>liament, a <i>mandamus</i> should not issue to compel the Court 
         <line/>of Directors to comply with the desire ofthe Board of Con<sh/>
         
         <line/>troul. On the 31st of January, 1834, the Court of King's 
         <line/>bench was prepared to give its decision upon the application 
         <line/>for the <i>mandamus</i>, when, without any reason being assigned, 
         <line/>the right hon. President of the Board of Controul withdrew 
         <line/>his application. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>C. Grant</small_caps> said that in the regret which had been
            express<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed respecting the possible collision between the two authorities, 
         <line/>he fully concurred; bu, entertaining such a sentiment, he 
         <line/>confessed it surprised him not a little to find his Right Hon. 
         <line/>Friend endeavouring to open a dispute already composed. 
         <line/>The right honourable gentleman then proceeded to give 
         <line/>a brief outline of the case, and referred to the various high 
         <line/>authorities connected with India, who had declared in favour 
         <line/>of the demand. With regard to his having withdrawn the ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>plication for the <i>mandamus</i> without explanation, he had to 
         <line/>say that he fully explain his opinions to the Directors, 
         <line/>he had re-stated them verbally to the chairman, and he did 
         <line/>not think himself required, under the circumstances, to re<sh/>
         
         <line/> enter into a long discussion upon the point. The effect of the 
         <line/>recommendation to the King of Oude was merely to urge the 
         <line/>claim upon his attention. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Sir <small_caps>R. Peel</small_caps> said it was a perfectly novel doctrine, and in
            the 
         <line/>present state of the world most inconvenient, that the non<sh/>
         
         <line/>payment of debts due to his subjects should give the King of 
         <line/>England a right forcibly to intervene with foreign states, ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>cept where sanctioned by positive treaty. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Hume</small_caps> contended, that on the whole, the debt was a just 
         <line/>one, and ought to be paid. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The subject here dropped.

            <small_caps>Admission of Dissenters to the Universities.</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the question that this bill be read a third time, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr T. <small_caps>Gladstone</small_caps> rose to oppose it. It would, he said, be 
         <line/>useless to pass the bill, for it would of necessity be inopera<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive. If he were asked why he opposed a bill which, if pass<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed, would be inoperative, his answer was that he objected 
         <line/>to its principle, the admission of which was equally destruc<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive, whether it effected the object of its promoters or not. 
         <line/>Further, they were bound to respect corporate rights as long 
         <line/>as the intentions of their founders were fulfilled ; and no one 
         <line/>could deny that the Universities did fulfilthe intentions of 
         <line/>their founders." (Hear, hear.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr V. <small_caps>Smith</small_caps> supported the bill, as one calculated to take 
         <line/>away a reproach from the Establishment, and be felt as a 
         <line/>compliment by the Dissenters, whose only desire was to exer<sh/>
         
         <line/>cise their vigorous intellects in the promotion of science 
         <line/>and literature. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Baines</small_caps> said, that the original statutes showed that there 
         <line/>were then no tests, nor did any exist at Oxford, in either the 
         <line/>time of the Lollards or of Wickliff. The term University had 
         <line/>in it an argument for thegeneral use of these seats of learn<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, which were meant to be universal, both as to the sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>jects taught, and the persons to whom they were communi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cated. In this sense, the term was understood and applied in 
         <line/>other countries, and it was an extraordinary fact, deserving 
         <line/>of attention, that the Universities of Oxford and of Cambridge 
         <line/>were the only universities that were closed to a large pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>portion of the upper classes of the people in any country in 
         <line/>Europe. This the Dissenters of England felt as a grievous 
         <line/>indignity, and they thought it unjust that Englishmen should 
         <line/>attempt to degrade Englishmen by excluding them from the 
         <line/>best seats of literature and science. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr H. <small_caps>Hughes</small_caps> could not accede to the measure, and there<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore moved that it be read that day six months. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>Goulburn</small_caps> contended that the introduction of the Dis<sh/>
         
         <line/>senters, as proposed under the present bill, would be nothing 
         <line/>short of the destruction of the present system of education at 
         <line/>the Universities. It was indisputable that at a University, re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ligion could only be taught according to some set form : 
         <line/>abandon that mode of tuition, and you abandon the religion 
         <line/>itself. (Cries of "No, no.") If they let in Dissenters, it was 
         <line/>perfectly obvious the intentions of the founders of those es<sh/>
         
         <line/>tablishments would be completely defeated : he therefore de<sh/>
         
         <line/>precated the measures as injurious to religon and opposed to 
         <line/>the best interest of the country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Lord <small_caps>Palmerstone</small_caps>, Sir R. <small_caps>Inglis</small_caps>,
            and Mr G. <small_caps>Wood</small_caps> then 
         <line/>addressed the house, but amidst such discordant noises as 
         <line/>prevented what they said being heard. The laughing, jeer<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, shouting, were such as has seldom been heard. In par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticular two hon. members who entered from the smoking 
         <line/>room into the opposite gallery during the address of Mr 
         <line/>Wood, and who stretched themselves at full length on the 
         <line/>seats secure from the observation of the Speaker, kept up a 
         <line/>row of the most discreditable character. The Speaker, with 
         <line/>much indignation in his tone and manner, called the parties 
         <line/>to order. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The motion for the third reading was carried, on a division, 
         <line/>by 164 to 25. 
         <column/>
         <line/>The Trading Companies Bill, the Arms Importation (Ire<sh/>
         
         <line/>land) Bill, and the Court of Chancery (Ireland) Bill, went 
         <line/>through committees. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Four Courts (Dublin) Bill, the Weights and Measures 
         <line/>Bill, and the Turnpike Acts Amendment Bill, were read a 
         <line/>third time and passed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Almanack Stamps Repeal Bill, the Assessed Taxes 
         <line/>Repeal Bill, and the Militia Ballot Suspension Bill, were 
         <line/>brought in, and read a first time.

      <p>
         <line/>The house was counted out at three o'clock in the morning.

      <p>
         <line/>Mr S. <small_caps>Rice</small_caps> moved the order of the day for the house 
         <line/>to resolve into Committee upon the Bill for the Colonization 
         <line/>of Southern Australia, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr A.<small_caps>Baring</small_caps> rose and stated various objections to the
            pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ject. The hon. member contended that at this period of the 
         <line/>year there was not time to deliberate upon such an important 
         <line/>subject, and, independent of this preliminary objection, he 
         <line/>said he did not conceive that government ought to sanction 
         <line/>any such experiment without a full conviction that there was 
         <line/>a reasonable probability of its success. In his opinion the 
         <line/>experiment was founded upon bases more mistaken than any 
         <line/>similar one which had ever been tried. In fact, according to 
         <line/>the plan which had been laid down, the colony would be tied 
         <line/>up by mortgages in such a way, that it would not again re<sh/>
         
         <line/>vert to the Crown, so that the territory would be lost. The 
         <line/>result would be, that if the gentlemen who set the project on 
         <line/>foot were mistaken–as he was sure they had been–we would 
         <line/>be prevented from touching this large portion of Australia, 
         <line/>unless we could pay off the debt which had been contracted. 
         <line/>While he stated these objections to the plan, he was anxious 
         <line/>not to be understood to be inimical to colonization, for 
         <line/>he was very favourable to it. Every new opening to co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lonization he was convinced was a substantial benefit to the 
         <line/>poorer classes, (Hear, hear, hear.) It was not, therefore, 
         <line/>to the principle of colonization that he was opposed, 
         <line/>but he objected to this bill becaue the plan was a most 
         <line/>mistaken one, and would eventually shut up this large 
         <line/>portion of the world. One of his main objections was to the 
         <line/>extent to which it was proposed to carry the experiment. Let 
         <line/>the gentlemen take, if they like, 100 square miles, but let 
         <line/>them not risk the whole of a great continent. People, like 
         <line/>fuel, he said, could not well be carried too far ; they might 
         <line/>get a few thousands to go out, but they would never get the 
         <line/>tens of thousands to go which were required for the success of 
         <line/>the project. The hon. member then objected to two of the 
         <line/>principles which were laid down by the projectors, that land 
         <line/>should not be sold lower than 12s. per acre, and that no credit 
         <line/>should be given. He was convinced that any man acquainted 
         <line/>with the practical workings of the system in other colonies, 
         <line/>would blow up the whole plan in a moment. No man who 
         <line/>went out to Australia would think of taking less than two 
         <line/>hundred acres. Now that would cost him &#x163;120; it would 
         <line/>cost him &#x163;120 more to get himself and his family over; which, 
         <line/>with stock and other expenses, would amount to &#x163;500 or &#x163;600. 
         <line/>He would, therefore, ask any gentlemen in that house, whe<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther they thought any man who had &#x163;500 or &#x163;600 in this 
         <line/>country, would go out and set himself down on two hundred 
         <line/>acres in Australia. (Hear, hear.) He therefore suggested to 
         <line/>his right hon. friend to consent that the committee be post<sh/>
         
         <line/>poned until another session, and then have it referred to a 
         <line/>select committee. He concluded by moving, as an amend<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment, that the bill be committed on that day six months. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr W. <small_caps>Whitmore</small_caps> was thakful for the very candid manner 
         <line/>in which the hon. member had stated his objections to the bill. 
         <line/>With respect to the large extent of territory, he (Mr W.) 
         <line/>thought that was necessary, as it was intended to introduce a 
         <line/>completely new system of colonization–one very different from 
         <line/>any thing ever before attempted. The extent of land it was 
         <line/>intended to take under this act was from 500,000 to 600,000 
         <line/>square miles, and it was the leading principle of the bill that 
         <line/>all the money arising from the sale of lands should be applied 
         <line/>to the purpose of sending out labourers free of expense.– 
         <line/>(Hear, hear, hear.) If this plan succeeded, there would be a 
         <line/>constant stream of emigrants going out. The land sold by the 
         <line/>Canada Company had been at a higher price. He had san<sh/>
         
         <line/>guine hopes that all the money it would be necessary to 
         <line/>borrow would be easily repaid. He most conscientously con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sidered that this bill would prove a very great benefit to the 
         <line/>country. It would tend exceedingly towards facilitating and 
         <line/>amending the conditions of the people of England and Ireland, 
         <line/>and therefore he hoped it would pass. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr <small_caps>O'Dwyer</small_caps> contended that, before the house thought of 
         <line/>agreeing to such a bill as this, they ought to do something 
         <line/>towards the ameloriation of the condition of the people of 
         <line/>Ireland. The various reports which committees of that house 
         <line/>had made, showed that one-fourth of the land of that country 
         <line/>was untilled, but was at the same time what was called re<sh/>
         
         <line/>claimable land, and well calculated for the cultivation and 
         <line/>produce of grain. Let this country advance some of the sur<sh/>
         
         <line/>plus capital talked of by the hon. member towards the culti<sh/>
         
         <line/>vation of this bog land, and discontent would flee[?] from Ire<sh/>
         
         <line/>land entirely. The Irish people wanted employment, give 
         <line/>them that and the house would hear no more about murders, 
         <line/>fires, and other outrages. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr S. <small_caps>Rice</small_caps> in reference to the allusion made by the hon. 
         <line/>and learned member, begged to say that, although much of 
         <line/>the bog land in question belonged to private individuals, yet a 
         <line/>portion of it was the property of the Government, who had 
         <line/>been, and still were, making experiments, with a view to as<sh/>
         
         <line/>certain if the views of the Commissioners could be carried into 
         <line/>effect. With respect to the manner in which the hon. mem<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber for Essex had opened this question, he must confess that 
         <line/>he had brought with him much of usefulness and of experi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ence, and of such a character, too, as could not fail to carry 
         <line/>weight. The right hon. gentleman then proceeded to speak 
         <line/>in favour of the proposed colonization of South Australia 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>After some farther discussion, strangers were ordered to 
         <line/>withdraw, and the house divided, when there appeared–For 
         <line/>going into committee, 72; against it 7–Majority, 65. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The bill went through the committee. The report was re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceived, and ordered to be taken into further consideration on 
         <line/>Thursday next. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Several petitions were presented, and, at three o'clock, the 
         <line/>Speaker left the chair.

         <line/>Colonel C. J. Napier has been appointed Governor 
         <line/>of the embryo colony in South Australia, and we be<sh/>
         
         <line/>lieve that a fitter appointment could not have been 
         <line/>made. We only regret that Colonel Napier has not 
         <line/>been sent to superintend a colony founded on some<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing like sane principles. But if this Austra<sh/>
         
         <line/>lian project end, as we have little doubt it will do, 
         <line/>in the ruin of those who are weak and silly enough to 
         <line/>embark in it, no one will ascribe any part of the fail<sh/>
         
         <line/>ure to the incapacity or unfitness of the Governor. 
         <line/>The whole blame will fall on the contrivers of the

         <line/>grants who have left Liverpool for the British colonies 
         <line/>and the United States of America, it appears that from 
         <line/>the 7th of May 1833, to the 30th September 1834, 
         <line/>3,121 persons left there for the colonies, and 27,486 
         <line/>for the United States, making a grand total of 30,607 
         <line/>persons. The ships employed were 455 ; the tonnage 
         <line/>196,058, and the crews, 8,9956. The chief of the emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grants to the United States, disembarked at New 
         <line/>York, 24,311 having landed there. Of the emigrants 
         <line/>to the colonies, 1,289 went to Australia, and 1,227 
         <line/>to Quebec. The emigration to the West Indies dur<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the above period, only amounted to 12 to the 
         <line/>smaller islands, 3 to Antigua, 32 to Jamaica, and 26 
         <line/>to Demerara. The emigrants to Van Diemen's Land 
         <line/>were 135.

            <i>South Australia.</i>–The act of Parliament for found<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing this colony will now come into full operation ; the 
         <line/>Commissioners having complied with the conditions 
         <line/>precedent, by the sale of &#x163;35,000 worth of land, and 
         <line/>by raisingthe required loan for the government of the 
         <line/>colony. We may therefore expect shortly to see the 
         <line/>names of the various officers gazetted (some of them 
         <line/>have been long ago nominated) ; and we understand 
         <line/>that active preparations are making with a view to the 
         <line/>immediate departure of the officers and a small body 
         <line/>of emigrants. This first expedition will be placed un<sh/>
         
         <line/>der the command of Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., the 
         <line/>Governor ; who, with the assistance of the Surveyors 
         <line/>and other qualified persons, will carefully examine the 
         <line/>various harbours in the colony, the quality of the 
         <line/>neighbouring soil, the supply of water, &amp;c. ; and will 
         <line/>select that site which, all things considered, is most 
         <line/>desirable for the first town. We believe it is the in<sh/>
         
         <line/>tention of the Commissions not to send out the main 
         <line/>body of emigrants until the next spring, so as to allow

         <line/>There have been 300 convents suppressed within 
         <line/>the last three years. The example was set by the 
         <line/>Emperor of Russia, who, was by an ukase, dated 31st 
         <line/>July 1832, abolished 187 convents of monks. This 
         <line/>was followed by the King of Prussia, who, by a royal 
         <line/>order, secularised all the convents in the Duchy of 
         <line/>Posen. In 1834, Don Pedro put down 300 convents, 
         <line/>and Spain has lately abolished 1800.

         <line/>boon, both by individuals and the colony at large. In 
         <line/>all the colonies there appears to be a scarcity of work<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing people, as from an official document in our posses<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion, it is asserted, on authority, that in Upper Canada 
         <line/>agricultural labourers, domestic servants, and trades<sh/>
         
         <line/>men of every description, will be for some years in 
         <line/>great request. Farm labourers readily obtain from 
         <line/>&#x163;25 to &#x163;30 per annum, with board, lodging, and 
         <line/>washing, and day-labourers from 3s. to 4s. per day, 
         <line/>with provisions. The government agent for emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion for the Canadas asserts he could find imme<sh/>
         
         <line/>diate employment for 20,000 working people, as pub<sh/>
         
         <line/>lic improvements are much retarded for want of hands. 
         <line/>As this is the best season, we would advise all those 
         <line/>intending to emigrate to apply to the government 
         <line/>agent for emigration at the Custom House, Leith, 
         <line/>who will give gratuitous information regarding the 
         <line/>colonies, and advise as to the best method of putting 
         <line/>their plans into execution. The rate of wages for 
         <line/>every description of mechanics may be likewise seen 
         <line/>there.

            <small_caps>Australian Colonies</small_caps>.–We have seen a print<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed circular containing extracts of a letter from Mr 
         <line/>John Sullivan, surgeon-superintendent of the Emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>grant ship <i>Canton</i>, dated Sydney, 6th October 1835, 
         <line/>addressed to Edward Forster, Esq. chairman of the 
         <line/>Emigration Committee, London. In this letter Mr 
         <line/>Sullivan mentions that the female emigrants, on land<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, were placed in spacious and commodious build<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings, adjoining the Government House, at Syd<sh/>
         
         <line/>ney, where every attention was paid to their com<sh/>
         
         <line/>fort and security from improper intrusion. The 
         <line/>writer further states :–" We landed in Sydney a 
         <line/>greater proportion of well conducted, industrious, and 
         <line/>virtuous young women, than were ever before landed 
         <line/>from any of the ships of the Emigration Committee 
         <line/>that came to these Colonies. Three-fourths of the 
         <line/>young women were engaged, and went into comfort<sh/>
         
         <line/>able situations, on the first and second days after land<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing ; and before a week all the useful and good ser<sh/>
         
         <line/>vants, viz. laundresses, cooks, servants of all work, 
         <line/>dairymaids, and housekeepers, were in places, many 
         <line/>of them in Syndey and the surroundings districts ; se<sh/>
         
         <line/>veral were taken up the country to Maitland and 
         <line/>Bathurst ; and as many more cooks, laundresses, dairy<sh/>
         
         <line/>maids, or farm servants as we had, could obtain places 
         <line/>in that time, for these are the descriptions of female 
         <line/>servants in demand throughout the colony. The 
         <line/>wages varied from &#x163;8 to &#x163;20. Some, who were not 
         <line/>very good servants of all work and housemaids, got 
         <line/>&#x163;8 to &#x163;10 ; cooks and laundresses, &#x163;12 to &#x163;16 (the 
         <line/>latter are much wanted) ; housemaids and needlewo<sh/>
         
         <line/>men, &#x163;10 to &#x163;12 ; housekeepers, &#x163;16 to &#x163;20. Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernesses also are much sought for it ; if we had had 
         <line/>twenty qualified they could have got situations in 
         <line/>respectable families and schools ; but the salaries to 
         <line/>this class are small, say &#x163;25 to &#x163;40. Nursery gover<sh/>
         
         <line/>nesses got &#x163;20. All the male emigrants who under<sh/>
         
         <line/>stood agriculture, or the management of stock in ge<sh/>
         
         <line/>neral, but particularly sheep, were engaged imme<sh/>
         
         <line/>diately, at salaries varying from &#x163;40 to &#x163;50, with a 
         <line/>house and rations for family use." We understand 
         <line/>that the <i>Canton</i> had a number of females from Edin<sh/>
         
         <line/>burgh and its neighbourhood, and the above informa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion must be highly satisafactory to their relatives.

            <small_caps>Sir George Clerk.</small_caps>–As the cawing of the rooks 
         <line/>portends a storm, it is worth while to mention that 
         <line/>the cunning baronet has come down from London, 
         <line/>and commenced a canvass in this county within these 
         <line/>few days. It is stated, we believe upon good autho<sh/>
         
         <line/>rity, that he accounts for this course of proceeding, 
         <line/>by referring to the great probability of the Lords

         <line/>finished state, to the surprise of strangers, and the 
         <line/>discredit to our Modern Athens. The sum already 
         <line/>in the Treasurer's hands, aided by the profits of the 
         <line/>handsome musical work lately issued by Mr M'Leod, 
         <line/>which he has generously devoted to that purpose, is 
         <line/>now nearly sufficient to meet the calculations of the 
         <line/>expense requird for the railing in and decoration of 
         <line/>the ground around the monument. We expect, there<sh/>
         
         <line/>fore, that the work will forthwith be commenced, and 
         <line/>if a few pounds are still wanted, we have no doubt 
         <line/>there are hundreds in Edinburgh who would wil<sh/>
         
         <line/>lingly guarantee the Treasurer against any loss by 
         <line/>the immediate completion of the undertaking.

            <i>Annuity Tax.</i>–We understand that deputations

         <line/>Tuesday evening, for the purpose of petitioning Par<sh/>

         <line/>Stewarton, ordained, and the Rev D. Ronald, of Salt<sh/>
         
         <line/>coats, gave the charge to the minister and congrega<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion. On the Sabbath following, the Rev. Mr Tait, 
         <line/>of Barrhead, introduced Mr Macgregor to his con<sh/>
         
         <line/>gregation ; and there is every prospect that the hither<sh/>

         <line/>now prosper under the pastoral care of their much

            <i>Presentation of Plate.</i>–Mr A. S. Walker, late of

         <line/>of the branch of the Commercial Bank of England, 
         <line/>at Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, was lately presented 
         <line/>with an elegant tea service by the proprietors of that 
         <line/>establishment, bearing the following inscription :– 
         <line/>"Presented to Mr Archibald S. Walker, by the 
         <line/>Uttoxeter Proprietors of the Commercial Bank of 
         <line/>England, as a small acknowledgement of his faithful 
         <line/>and valuable services–March, 1836." This is ano<sh/>
         
         <line/>ther proof of the estimation in which many of the 
         <line/>young men are held who have been trained to the 
         <line/>banking system in this country. 
         <column/>
         <line/>From a Return, just published, we find that the 
         <line/>emigration to Canada has been comparatively small 
         <line/>last year. The whole number of emigrants landed at 
         <line/>Quebec and Montreal in 1835, was 12,527 : in 1831 
         <line/>and 1832 four times, and in 1834 two times as many 
         <line/>were sent out. Of the 12,527, there were 5597 adult 
         <line/>males, 3866 females, and 3064 children under 14 
         <line/>years. Of the whole number, 1043 were sent out by 
         <line/>parochial aid. The numbers from the three king<sh/>
         
         <line/>doms were– 
         <line/>England, 3067 
         <line/>Ireland, 7,108 
         <line/>Scotland, 2,127 
         <line/>From Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, &amp;c. 225 
         <line/>Settled in Lower Canada, 2,297 
         <line/>Upper Canada, 9,800 
         <line/>Died at Grosse Isle and Quebec, 13

         <line/>Removed to the United States, 300 
         <line/>–12,527 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>But besides those who went to Canada, 16,749 
         <line/>landed at New York, raising the whole number of 
         <line/>emigrants to 29,376. There were no less than three 
         <line/>vessels wrecked last year on their way to Quebec– 
         <line/>the William Ewing from Londonderry with 300 pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sengers, all saved–the barque James from Newfound<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, all saved–and the Nathaniel Graham from 
         <line/>Cork, with 48 persons on board, passengers and crew, 
         <line/>of whom 41 were lost. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From another part of the Report, we find that 2764 
         <line/>female emigrants were sent out to Australia last year, 
         <line/>under the superintendence of the Emigration Com<sh/>

         <line/>alterations and repairs on the chapel, amounting to 
         <line/>&#x163;935, was accepted, and it will gratify the friends of 
         <line/>economy to learn, that this is &#x163;65 under the sum 
         <line/>voted by a majority of the Governors for that purpose 
         <line/>some time ago. Thereafter a unanimous vote of 
         <line/>thanks was passed to Councillor Gillespie Graham, 
         <line/>for gratuitously furnishing a plan of the intended 
         <line/>improvements on the chapel, which was described by

         <line/>the skill and good taste of that distinguished archi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tect. The Governors then proceeded to consider the 
         <line/>list of applications for admission of boys, preparatory 
         <line/>to the usual half-yearly election. There were 16 
         <line/>vacancies and 37 applicants, who may be thus

      <p>
         <line/>Those who have never received benefit from

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In considering cases the present practise of the Go<sh/>
         
         <line/>vernors is to give preference, first to children of wi<sh/>
         
         <line/>dows (being poor), then to those who have never re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceived benefit, afterwards those who have had only 
         <line/>one child in, and so on. These were but three appli<sh/>
         
         <line/>cations for widow's children, and one for an orphan, 
         <line/>out of the above number, and it is therefore probable, 
         <line/>considering the large population of Edinburgh, that 
         <line/>it is not sufficiently known, that George Heriot, in 
         <line/>his will, expressly points out the <i>fatherless</i> and <i>poor</i>, 
         <line/>being children of burgesses and freemen, as the ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>jects of his charity–hence, if there be not a sufficient 
         <line/>numbers of really necessitous cases, the Governors, in 
         <line/>filling up the vacancies, may elect some that do not 
         <line/>appear to have strong claims, simply from those that

         <line/>gagement on Thursday evening–an engagement 
         <line/>the longest and most brilliant of any that our 
         <line/>Theatre has witnessed for many years. Mr Kean 
         <line/>has been with us for a whole month, and has suc<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceeded in crowding the house almost every night. 
         <line/>We understand that upwards of 30,000 persons have 
         <line/>visited the theatre during his engagement–a number 
         <line/>beyond that of any former period of equal duration. 
         <line/>In that time he has appeared in some of the most 
         <line/>arduous and difficult of Shakespeare's characters 
         <line/>Hamlet, Richard, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock, and 
         <line/>King John, investing each with its own peculiar 
         <line/>charms and interest, and exciting the highest admira<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion and astonishment at the versatility and power of 
         <line/>his genius, which could give such individuality and 
         <line/>truth to so many dissimilar, distinct, and separate 
         <line/>classes of characters. The play with which his en<sh/>
         
         <line/>gagement concluded was Richard, which character he has 
         <line/>performed <i>seven</i> times during his engagement ; the house 
         <line/>was, as usual, crowded in every part, and he exerted 
         <line/>himself most strenuously and successfully. At the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>clusion the cheers of the audience were loud and long, 
         <line/>and two laurel wreaths were thrown upon the stage 
         <line/>from different parts of the house. Mr K. being loud<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly called for, appeared in front of the stage, and de<sh/>
         
         <line/>livered the following very neat and appropriate ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>dress:–"<i>Ladies and Gentlemen,</i>–I now stand before 
         <line/>you for the last time this season, but believe me 
         <line/>whichever way my pilgrimage may bend, my thoughts 
         <line/>will ever recur to Edinburgh as those of a child to 
         <line/>its distant home, fondly anticipating the hour when 
         <line/>he shall again stand upon its threshold. (Great cheer<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing.) Till that period permit me with a heavy, but a 
         <line/>grateful heart, to pronounce that melancholy word– 
         <line/>farewell." (Mr Kean then withdrew amidst reiterated 
         <line/>and enthusiastic plaudits from all parts of the house.) 
         <line/>–Mr K. we perceive, appears next in Aberdeen, 
         <line/>where the people are anticipating a rich treat from his

            <i>Qualifications of General Assembly Elders.</i>–The 
         <line/>Presbytery of Cupar, at their meeting on the 29th ult. 
         <line/>elected the Earl of Leven and Melville, and Walter 
         <line/>Malcolm, Esq. Edinburgh, to represent them in the 
         <line/>ensuing Assembly. Mr Malcolm is factor for Cap<sh/>
         
         <line/>tain Hay of Mugdrum, who is principal heritor in 
         <line/>the parish of Newburgh, and was lately ordained an 
         <line/>elder there. Against his election to serve in the As<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembly a protest and appeal were taken, on the grounds, 
         <line/>as we understand, that he has no domicile within the 
         <line/>bounds of Presbytery, and is not an officiating elder; 
         <line/>the protesters allowing that his election, though con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sistent with the letter, is contrary to the spirit of an 
         <line/>act of Assembly passed in 1816. If the appeal is 
         <line/>sustained, it is evident that a large proportion of the 
         <line/>Assembly elders must vacate their seats. Intimation 
         <line/>also was given by D. Maitland M'Gill, Esq., that 
         <line/>when the commissions came to be attested, he would 
         <line/>move for evidence being produced that the elders-elect 
         <line/>maintain family worship. An amusing inquiry was 
         <line/>instituted in the Presbytery last year respecting the 
         <line/>Earl of Leven's habits of domestic devotion ; and a 
         <line/>clerical member had the candour to say, he should 
         <line/>wish to know how it was with the ministers themselves 
         <line/>in that respect.

         <line/>The University of St Andrews has just conferred

         <line/>honour on one, who, during a long and useful life, has 
         <line/>done so much for the cause of literature and religion, 
         <line/>the members of the College have done an act which 
         <line/>shows that they can appreciate real merit, and which 
         <line/>will entitle them to the gratitude of the religious pub<sh/>
         
         <line/>lic of Scotland. Those who have had the good for<sh/>
         
         <line/>tune to enjoy the public ministrations of Professor 
         <line/>Paxton, and even the general church-going commu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nity, are well aware of the rich and glowing eloquence, 
         <line/>of the pious and heartfelt warmth, and of the classical 
         <line/>elegance which have long characterised his public 
         <line/>preaching. Even beyond the religious body of which 
         <line/>he is the ornament, he is well known as one of the 
         <line/>most popular and impressive teachers of the day. In 
         <line/>his lectures on Theology, as Professor to the General 
         <line/>Associate Synod, and afterwards to the Associate 
         <line/>Synod, he displayed the results of an extensive and 
         <line/>profound critical study of the Scriptures, and of an 
         <line/>unwearied research into the Natural History, and the 
         <line/>manners and usages of the ancients nations. The 
         <line/>work by which he is chiefly known as an author– 
         <line/>
            <i>The Illustrations of Scripture</i>–will long bear testi<sh/>
         
         <line/>mony to the extent of his learning, and of his Orien<sh/>
         
         <line/>tal investigations, and to his powers of lucid and elo<sh/>
         
         <line/>quent composition. We understand that the attention 
         <line/>of the College was directed to Mr Paxton's merits by 
         <line/>the distinguished Professor of Oriental Languages. 
         <line/>This anxiety to do justice to a fellow labourer in the

         <line/>last, the Students ofthe Edinburgh Veterinary Col<sh/>
         
         <line/>lege and a number of Veterinary Surgeons and other 
         <line/>gentlemen (in all upwards of 70) from various parts 
         <line/>of Scotland, entertained Professor Dick to a public 
         <line/>dinner in the Waterloo Hotel. John Lambert, Esq. 
         <line/>in the Chair, and Alexander Gordon, jun Esq. crou<sh/>
         
         <line/>pier. The stewards were Ed. Pyper, Esq. of West 
         <line/>Craigs, J. R. Laing, Esq. jun of Dunkenny, Sa<sh/>
         
         <line/>muel Wordsworth, jun. Esq. W.S., Dr Malcolm, 
         <line/>James Miller, Esq. and George Rennie, Esq.– 
         <line/>Amongst the gentlemen present we observed Professors 
         <line/>Low and Lizars ; Drs Robertson, Spittal, Knox, and 
         <line/>Aitken, Mr Ferguson, surgeon ; J. B. Murdoch, 
         <line/>Esq. of Coldoch; Charles Gordon, Esq. Secretary

         <line/>wood, Esq. of Oggs Castle ; Mr Dick, senior &amp;c. 
         <line/>The cloth having been removed and the usual loyal 
         <line/>toasts drank, the chairman, in a neat and appropriate 
         <line/>speech, proposed the health of Professor Dick, to 
         <line/>whom the present meeting had assembled to do ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>nour, and who at once commanded their esteem as a 
         <line/>member of society and their admiration as a man of 
         <line/>talent, which toast was drank with the greatest en<sh/>
         
         <line/>thusiasm. The chairman then proposed his Grace 
         <line/>the Duke of Gordon and the Highland and Agricul<sh/>
         
         <line/>tural Society of Scotland, Patrons of the Edinburgh 
         <line/>Veterinary College, which was followed by a variety 
         <line/>of other appropriate toasts. Many excellent songs 
         <line/>were sung, and the conviviality of the evening was 
         <line/>kept up until a late hour. 
      </p>

            <i>Royal Infirmary</i>–We understand that the Ste<sh/>
         
         <line/>wards of the late Fancy Ball for the benefit of the 
         <line/>Royal Infirmary have, by their judicious arrange<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments in the management of the ball, been enabled to 
         <line/>pay over to the trustees of that institution, (after de<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducting all expenses) the sum of &#x163;432, 7s. 8d. The 
         <line/>managers of the Infirmary, as well as the public at 
         <line/>large, are certainly much indebted to the gentlemen 
         <line/>who acted as stewards upon that occasion, for their 
         <line/>valuable extertions, particularly at the present time, in 
         <line/>support of this great and useful institution, for the 
         <line/>relief of those labouring under the united calamities 
         <line/>of indigence and disease.

         <line/>Papers from Madras to the 17th of January have 
         <line/>been received. Accounts had arrived through Singa<sh/>
         
         <line/>pore, from the ship Mangles, stating that when pass<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing through Torres Straits she touched at Murray's 
         <line/>Island, where they discovered eight Europeans, part 
         <line/>of the crew of the long-missing bark, Charles Eaton, 
         <line/>in a state of slavery, but the natives would not deliver 
         <line/>up the men. The Charles Eaton was supposed to 
         <line/>have been lost on the Barrier Reef, in Torres Straits, 
         <line/>in 1833, in prosecution of her voyage from New South 
         <line/>Wales to Madras, but no precise intelligence of her 
         <line/>fate was previously known. The ironworks which 
         <line/>had been erected at Porto Novo were proceeding with 
         <line/>activity, and some railing had been made there, quite 
         <line/>equal, it is stated to anything og the kind manufac<sh/>

            <i>(From a Correspondent.)</i>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Our penal settlements appear to be very indifferent<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly managed; and we are glad to find that such a man 
         <line/>as Sir John Franklin is appointed to govern Van Die<sh/>
         
         <line/>men's Land; and the sooner an improved system is 
         <line/>adopted for New South Wales, the better. Not only 
         <line/>are men sent out to govern who are ignorant of human 
         <line/>nature, a knowledge of which is essential to the manage<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of the heterogenous materials of our penal colo<sh/>
         
         <line/>nies; but when the Government at home opens its eyes 
         <line/>to any proposal for improvement,it is mismanaged. Our 
         <line/>rulers have the sense to see the importance of sending 
         <line/>our respectable females to these colonies ; but they trust 
         <line/>an Emigration Committee, and this committee trusts 
         <line/>individuals who desire to make the most of the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>cern ; and we are glad to have an opportunity of mak<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the public acquainted with the mode in which 
         <line/>the business is conducted, in the hope that some hu<sh/>
         
         <line/>mane Member of Parliament will take the subject 
         <line/>up. The mode of managing female emigration is 
         <line/>this :– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A temptation, in the first place, is held out of a 
         <line/>free passage to Australia. A ship is hired, and this 
         <line/>ship must ave a <i>full</i> cargo, to satisfy the <i>owners.</i>
         
         <line/>Advertisements are issued, and instead of hard work<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing females, a parcel of decayed governesses, dress<sh/>
         
         <line/> makers, &amp;c. &amp;c., with a small mixture of better 
         <line/>articles, is made up. But if, as almost always hap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pens, a sufficient number of these to fill the ship 
         <line/>does not come forward, a supply of sweepings 
         <line/>is taken from a workhouse! Here, then, is such a 
         <line/>mixture of good, bad, and indifferent, to the amount 
         <line/>of two hundred and upwards, that there is enough 
         <line/>of evil to corrupt the good. As to the comfort of the 
         <line/>poor creatures they are crammed <small_caps>four into one</small_caps>
         
         <line/>
            <small_caps>bed</small_caps> ! 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Such is the power of jobbing, that we happen to 
         <line/>know the fact, that some young women of respectabi<sh/>
         
         <line/>lity who wished to go to New South Wales <i>with their</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>friends</i>, were refused a free passage, unless they went 
         <line/>to London to go in the Government ship ! Thus we 
         <line/>see that the interests of agents and shipowners over<sh/>
         
         <line/>comes the interests of the colonies, and actually ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>structs the attainment of the object in view. We find 
         <line/>blindness a very common ailment in every department 
         <line/>of Government ; and however desirous our rulrs may 
         <line/>be to reform every abuse, and to adopt useful mea<sh/>
         
         <line/>sures, they are often thwarted by the necessity (which 
         <line/>ought not to exist) of conciliating harpies and leeches, 
         <line/>which devour the public substance, and suck the pub<sh/>
         
         <line/>lic blood. Reform has, as yet, only begun to clean 
         <line/>the outside of the platter ; and it may not reach the 
         <line/>inside in our day. It is the duty, however, of all pa<sh/>
         
         <line/>triots, to sharpen the knife that is to cut out corruption 
         <line/>from the heart of the commonwealth, by means of ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>posure of every abuse that comes to be known, and to 
         <line/>support those who are willing to apply it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>As in a matter of so much importance nothing 
         <line/>should be concealed, there is no hesitation in stating 
         <line/>that it consists with our knowledge that, after the 
         <line/>Emigration Committee in Van Diemen's Land, detail<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing the deplorable consequences of sending out young 
         <line/>women from workhouses, a ship has actually sailed, 
         <line/>nearly filled up as we have described. When any 
         <line/>representation is made to a public office, the matter is 
         <line/>said to belong to another department ; and that other 
         <line/>department says it is not its province to interfere ; and 
         <line/>thus humanity is made the shuttlecock to the battle<sh/>
         
         <line/>dore of jobbing and the blindness of office. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>If our brethren of the press will take up this, the 
         <line/>inhuman job will be put an end to.

         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr Walter</small_caps> moved, pursuant to notice, that "an hum<sh/>
         
         <line/>ble address be presented to his Majesty, praying that he will 
         <line/>be graciously pleased to issue his royal orders that a placard 
         <line/>entitled "Emigration to Van Diemen's Land," which the se<sh/>
         
         <line/>veral postmasters throughout the kingdom have been directed 
         <line/>to put in a conspicuous place in their several post-offices, and 
         <line/>to circulate among the clergy and the parochial authorities 
         <line/>be withdrawn." He had been assured y several gentlemen 
         <line/>who had returned from Van Diemen's land, that many of the 
         <line/>young females sent out by the Emigration committee had 
         <line/>been irrevocable consigned to prostitution, and that such as 
         <line/>obtained services found themselves placed among a very dif<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferent calss of persons to that which they had been accustom<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to mix with in this country. The hon. member read an 
         <line/>extract from a Hobart Town paper, of the 19th of February 
         <line/>last, in which it was stated that some of the females "thus 
         <line/>launched into the world," were not more than twelve of thir<sh/>
         
         <line/>teen years old. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr Wakley</small_caps> seconded the motion. 
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Sir G. Grey</small_caps> adverted to the extraordinary object of the 
         <line/>address, when the information desired had in fact already 
         <line/>been given on a former day. He hoped, whatever informa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, correct or erroneous, might be circulated on the subject 
         <line/>of emigration, that the people of England would not adopt 
         <line/>their notions from anonymous paragraphs in Hobart Town 
         <line/>newspapers. According to the hon. member there was a sys<sh/>
         
         <line/>tem in operation by which people were driven out of the 
         <line/>country–actually turned out of it, as if they were so many 
         <line/>slaves. Now he could declare that there could be no more 
         <line/>unfounded statement than this. Though much good had ari<sh/>
         
         <line/>sen to the colonies and individuals, yet it could not be denied 
         <line/>that, in some instances, youn women had turned out badly 
         <line/>They had these facts upon authority–that many of those fe<sh/>
         
         <line/>males obtained respectable places. The names of the indivi<sh/>
         
         <line/>duals who obtained them, the dates of their arrival, the 
         <line/>mode of their meployment, were all to be found int he papers 
         <line/>on the table of the house. In conclusion, he begged of the 
         <line/>hon. member and others, when statements relative to emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration were made, to receive them with caution and reserve. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr C. Lushington</small_caps> defended the proceedigs of the Emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration Committee. he mainted that by their labours the 
         <line/>greatest posible good had been accomplished, hear, hear.) 
         <line/>He would then ask of any one to look at the names of the gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>men who were on that committee–to look at their charac<sh/>
         
         <line/>ters; and could any one who did so believe that the members 
         <line/>of that committee would be guilty of the sin of sendng out, 
         <line/>day after day, young females to the colonies–of thus duping 
         <line/>those unprotected creatures to their destruction? (hear, hear.) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Mr Walter</small_caps> replied. He had not relied for his state<sh/>
         
         <line/>ments upon newspapers, but upon official documents. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The motion was negatived without a division.

            <i>The Wool Trade, London, Thursday Evening.</i>–The follow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing are more accurate averages of the sales of Colonial Wools

         <line/>tain during their progress. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Colonial Wools offered consisted of 2041 bays. The 
         <line/>Wools have become much improved in growth, in length of 
         <line/>staple, in management, and in washing. The market being 
         <line/>very bare in combining wool, this description realized a propor<sh/>

         <line/>The Wool Trade is very brisk. The arrivals this week have 
         <line/>been 2300 bales, of which about 340 are German, 1000 Spa<sh/>
         
         <line/>nish, 300 New South Wales, 20 Cape of Good Hope, 50 Tur<sh/>

            <i>Huddersfield, Tuesday</i>.–There has been no visible change 
         <line/>in the state of this market for the last three or four weeks. 
         <line/>Business in general is pretty good.

            <i>Bradford, June</i> 30.–The activity we have so often had to 
         <line/>report in the piece market continues unabated, and in six 
         <line/>quarters, especially low and middle sorts, trade to-day is par<sh/>
         
         <line/>ticularly brisk. Whatever alteration there may be in the 
         <line/>yarn market, as compared with recent reports, is for the bet<sh/>
         
         <line/>ter. Stocks continue low in the staplers' hands, with very 
         <line/>little disposition to increase them. Prices remain very steady, 
         <line/>although the demand for wool is extremely limited. Farmers 
         <line/>are rather firmer. The Liverpool sales of New South Wales 
         <line/>Wool went off 1d to 2d per lb. above the recent London sales.

         <line/>
            <i>Rochdale, June</i> 27.–The market this week was very well 
         <line/>attended, but not so brisk as the last.–Low goods were much 
         <line/>in demand, and sold well. The trade in Rochdale is generally 
         <line/>good at present, and building is going on to a very considerale 
         <line/>extent.

            <i>York Wool Market, June</i> 30.–The quantity of wool brought 
         <line/>to this day's market, was not so large as that supplied last 
         <line/>week, nor was the attendance of buyers so numerous, yet a 
         <line/>considerable portion of business was done, and last week's 
         <line/>quotations were fully supported :–good, bred hog 18 1/2d ; half 
         <line/>hog and ewe, 16 1/2d to 17d ; all ewe, 15d to 15 1/2d ; locks without

         <line/>
            <small_caps>We</small_caps> have received the first annual Report of 
         <line/>new colony of South Australia, a Parliamentary paper 
         <line/>presented in June last. The site selected for the 
         <line/>colony is a part of the south coast of New Holland, 
         <line/>extending two or three hundred miles on each side of 
         <line/>Spencer's Gulf, and about 600 miles into the interior. 
         <line/>It was anticipated that the best central station would 
         <line/>be Port Lincoln at the entrance of Spencer's Gulf, on 
         <line/>the west side, or Nepean Bay, on the north coast of 
         <line/>Kangaroo Isle. Port Lincoln is in latitude 35, and 
         <line/>east longitude 136, about 700 miles right west from 
         <line/>Sydney, the same distance north-west from Van Die<sh/>
         
         <line/>men's Land, and about 1000 miles eastward of the co<sh/>
         
         <line/>lony at King George's Sound. Nepean Bay is about 
         <line/>100 miles east from Port Lincoln. The colony is 
         <line/>established under Parliamentary Commissioners, as 
         <line/>an experiment, we believe, to try whether it may not 
         <line/>be possible to execute an extensive plan of emigration 
         <line/>without any charge to the country, by selling lots of 
         <line/>land at such a price as would defray the expense of 
         <line/>conveying the emigrants from England. The plan 
         <line/>adopted is, to send out preferably young married per<sh/>
         
         <line/>sons under thirty, and to admit no slaves or convicts 
         <line/>into the colony. A company has embarked &#x163;35,000 
         <line/>in the enterprise. A surveying vessel was sent out in 
         <line/>March to examine the coast carefully, that the 
         <line/>best site might be chosen at first, and the ne<sh/>
         
         <line/>cessity of removal avoided. Six vessels altogether 
         <line/>had sailed down to the 1st May, carrying out 152 male 
         <line/>labourers with 37 females, and 26 male and 10 fe<sh/>
         
         <line/>males of a superior class. These numbers include 26 
         <line/>children. The Commissioners attempted at first to 
         <line/>get 20s. per acre for the land ; but finding it impos<sh/>
         
         <line/>sible, they reduced the price to 12s. By selling at 
         <line/>this price 437 lots, consisting each of a country sec<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of 134 acres, and a town section of one acre, they 
         <line/>had raised the &#x163;35,000 required by the act of Parlia<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment as the condition of the grant of land. We give 
         <line/>these few details to put our readers in a condition to 
         <line/>understand the notices which appear from time to 
         <line/>time in the papers respecting the colony. We hope 
         <line/>the Commissioners or the adventurers will give the 
         <line/>country a distinctive name. The title of "South 
         <line/>Australia" is bad any way, and even positively ab<sh/>
         
         <line/>surd ; since Australia (<i>quasi</i> Australasia,) originally 
         <line/>intended for New Holland, has already begun to be 
         <line/>monopolised by Van Diemen's Land. The district 
         <line/>at Spencer's Gulf, if it is to participated in the general 
         <line/>denomination, should be termed "North" rather than 
         <line/>"South" Australia. By the way, most of our colonies 
         <line/>in that quarter of the world have ridiculous names, as 
         <line/>is instantly perceived when we coin a nationa term for 
         <line/>the people out of them. What can be worse than a 
         <line/>"Van Diemen-lander ;" a "New South-Wales-ian ;"/&gt;
         <line/>a "Swan River-ite ;" or a "King-George's Sound<sh/>

            <small_caps>Highland Emigrants.</small_caps>–The ship " Midlo<sh/>
         
         <line/>thian" has just been fitted up at Leith for the reception 
         <line/>of Highland emigrants, which she is to take in at the 
         <line/>Isle of Skye for Sydney, New South Wales. These 
         <line/>emigrants are, we believw, to be carried out at a very 
         <line/>small cost to themselves, the largest portion of the 
         <line/>passage money being paid by Government out of the 
         <line/>land revenue of New South Wales, which is exclusive<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly appropriated towards the encouragement and promo<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion of emigration–the objects in view being, as well 
         <line/>the relief of those districts in this country which 
         <line/>are suffering from the want of employment and 
         <line/>subsistence, as by the introduction into that colony of 
         <line/>a body of well disposed and virtuous free emigrant fami<sh/>
         
         <line/>lies and individuals, the promotion of the moral welfare 
         <line/>of the colonists generally. The emigrants will, we be<sh/>
         
         <line/>lieve, receive employment in New South Wales as 
         <line/>farm-servants, shepherds, overseers, &amp;c. We had a 
         <line/>brief inspection of the " Midlothian" on Monday af<sh/>
         
         <line/>ternoon, and found it to be a very fine vessel, fitted 
         <line/>up in a manner the most comfortable and convenient 
         <line/>that could well be effected. She sails this afternoon 
         <line/>from Leith to the Isle of Skye.

         <line/>Thus the British Government is multiplying its 
         <line/>colonies round the shores of New Holland. Exclusive 
         <line/>of Van Diemen's Land, which forms a separate island, 
         <line/>we have first on the eastern shore the old settlement of 
         <line/>Port Jackson ; a second recently formed at Port Philip, 
         <line/>500 miles south from Sidney ; a third just described, at 
         <line/>St. Vincent's Gulf, 500 miles west from Port Philip ; 
         <line/>a fourth at King George's Sound, 1100 miles west 
         <line/>from St Vincent's Gulf ; a fifth at Swan River, 250 
         <line/>miles north from King George's South. All these 
         <line/>colonies are in the temperate zone, between the lati<sh/>
         
         <line/>tudes of 30 and 38, and will have nearly the 
         <line/>same climate. We had one at Melville Island, 
         <line/>on the north coast, within the torried zone, in latitude 
         <line/>12 ; but it was found to be very unhealthy, and was 
         <line/>abandoned, after a short trial, ten years ago. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Though the interior of New Holland, so far as 
         <line/>hitherto explored, is one of the most barren and un<sh/>
         
         <line/>promising lands in the world, there is a margin of 
         <line/>good soil round the greater part of its coasts, capabale 
         <line/>[?] of supporting twenty or thirty or fifty mil<sh/>
         
         <column/>
         <line/>lions of inhabitants; and there is little doubt that, in 
         <line/>the course of three centuries, it will be the seat of a 
         <line/>great and powerful nation, cultivating the arts, and 
         <line/>speaking the language of Britain, and contributing 
         <line/>powerfully to spread civilisation over the Southern 
         <line/>Hemisphere.

      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>The</small_caps> Annual Report on Emigration just issued 
         <line/>contains, besides the usual, correspondences and 
         <line/>documents connected with the plan which has been 
         <line/>some time in operation, of transferring labourers from 
         <line/>India to the Mauritius, and which it is now proposed 
         <line/>to extend to New South Wales. Leaving this sub<sh/>
         
         <line/>jest for the present, we shall state the general results[?] 
         <line/>of the emigration to Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Report shows, that the whole number of 
         <line/>emigrants who landed at Quebec or Montreal, in the 
         <line/>last nine years, was 259,788[?], averaging very nearly 
         <line/>29,000 per annum. The years of greatest emigration 
         <line/>were 1831 and 1832, the numbers for these years be<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing respectively 50,254 and 51,746. The proportions[?] [?] 
         <line/>furnished by the three kingdoms in the nine years 
         <line/>were as follows :–Among eight emigrants there were 
         <line/>five Irishmen, two Englishmen, and one Scotsman. 
         <line/>Scotland in proportion to its population has sent off 
         <line/>three times as many emigrants, and Ireland about 
         <line/>nine times as may as England; and it should be 
         <line/>added, that a certain part of the emigration from 
         <line/>England is artificial, consisting of paupers sent out at 
         <line/>the expense of their parishes. Emigrations offers the 
         <line/>most natural, practicable, and safe means of relieving a 
         <line/>country of its redundant or unemployed population ; 
         <line/>and it may be asked, why it is so much less resorted to 
         <line/>in England than in Scotland and Ireland? It cannot[?] 
         <line/>be the ignorance of the English, for this would lead 
         <line/>to the inference that the Irish, who emigrate in the 
         <line/>largest numbers, were the best informed of the three 
         <line/>nations. It is, we apprehend, nothing but the Poor 
         <line/>Laws, which hold out to the labourer the certainty of 
         <line/>a subsistence at home, however idle or improvident he 
         <line/>may be, and render him averse to live in the colo<sh/>
         
         <line/>nies, where he would have no such resource. This is 
         <line/>only one of the many evils which these laws have pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>duced, not only to the country at large, but to the la<sh/>
         
         <line/>bouring classes themselves, whose average condition 
         <line/>was greatly deteriorated, while only a fraction of their 
         <line/>number shared the benefit of the allowance. We 
         <line/>speak of the Poor Laws as they existed before the Act 
         <line/>of 1834 was passed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The number of emigrants who went to Canada 
         <line/>last year was 21,901, of whom 1399 went from 
         <line/>Scotland, 5580 from England, 14,538 from 
         <line/>Ireland, and 274 from Nova Scotia, Newfound<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, or the West Indies. In 1836 the number of 
         <line/>emigrants was 27,728. The ports in Scotland from 
         <line/>which the greatest numbers sail are Greenock, Leith, 
         <line/>Aberdeen, and Cromarty. Of the emigrants in 1837, 
         <line/>4000 settled in Lower Canada, 16,300 in Upper Cana<sh/>
         
         <line/>da, 1500 went to the United States, and ninety-two 
         <line/>died in the hospital or quarantine station. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In the same period of nine years, 236,288[?] British 
         <line/>emigrants have landed at new York, or fully 26,000 
         <line/>per annum on average. There is a great fluctua-[?] 
         <line/>tion in the number. In 1833 and 1835 it was only 
         <line/>16,000 ; in 1837 it was 34,000 ; in 1836 no less than 
         <line/>59,075 ; and addingthe 27,728 who went to Canada, 
         <line/>no less than 86,800 persons must have landed at New 
         <line/>York and Quebec from the British Isles in [?]. 
         <line/>There is a discrepancy, however, between this account 
         <line/>and another in a different Return, also newly pub<sh/>
         
         <line/>lished. The Report of the "Agent-General for Emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration," makes the number who went to the United 
         <line/>States from Britain in 1836, only 37,774. The for<sh/>
         
         <line/>mer probably comprehends all British born subjects, 
         <line/>including persons from Nova Scotia, Canada, and the 
         <line/>West Indies, and probably all passengers, many of 
         <line/>whom returned. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Agent-General gives the number of persons 
         <line/>who emigrated to the British Colonies and the United 
         <line/>States for every year since 1825. We present merely 
         <line/>the average for the last year seven years. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Annual number of Emigrants from Britain to 
         <line/>North American Colonies, 39[?],00 
         <line/>Ditto do. to United States, 34,[?]00 
         <line/>Ditto do. to Cape of Good Hope, 20[?] 
         <line/>Ditto do. to Australian Colonies, 3[?]0 
         <line/>73[?],[?] 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In 1832, the number who emigrated to these Colo<sh/>
         
         <line/>nies was no less than 103,140. The number who 
         <line/>went out to Australia in 1837, was much greater than 
         <line/>in any preceding year, being 5054. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>If we assume that each emigrant pays for his pas<sh/>
         
         <line/>sage, &amp;c., or has in his pocket &#x163;30, the average net[?] 
         <line/>expended on emigration will be about two millions per 
         <line/>annum. It may be correctly stated now, that human 
         <line/>beings form no inconsiderable <i>item</i>, in number and 
         <line/>value, of our exports. In the case of Ireland we sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose it is by far the most flourishing, and by no means 
         <line/>the least advantageous branch of the national com<sh/>
         
         <line/>merce. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The annual increment of the population of 
         <line/>British Isles is about 330,000, independently of the 
         <line/>efflux by emigration ; but including this, it must be 
         <line/>about 420,000. It follows that there are about [?] 
         <line/>more inhabitants in the country each day than there 
         <line/>were on the day before. Of the 1150 additional mortals[?] 
         <line/>emigration carries off 200. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The establishment of steam navigation across the 
         <line/>Atlantic will, no doubt, give a new impulse to the 
         <line/>circulation of human beings, while the construction of 
         <line/>railroads across the Alleganies, and of canals in Canada, 
         <line/>will greatly increase the capacity of the western world 
         <line/>to absorb the imported multitudes. In seven years 
         <line/>hence, the journey from London to Missouri will be 
         <line/>shorter in point of time, and perhaps cheaper, than the 
         <line/>journey from Washington to Missouri was seven years 
         <line/>ago. A religious man might see something like the 
         <line/>finger of Providence in the fact, that just at the time 
         <line/>France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, 
         <line/>begin to feel severely the pressure of a redundant po<sh/>
         
         <line/>pulation, inventions have started into existence which 
         <line/>may be said to annihilate space, and bring the most 
         <line/>thinly inhabited parts of the world, into juxtaposition 
         <line/>with the most overpeopled. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From the American Almanac, we find that the num<sh/>
         
         <line/>ber of passengers who arrived in the United States in 
         <line/>1836, was 81,000, of whom 4000 were native Ameri<sh/>
         
         <line/>cans. The proportion of emigrants from the different 
         <line/>foreign countries was– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From the British Isles, 47,792 
         <line/>... British American Colonies, 2,681 
         <line/>... Germany, 20,142 
         <line/>... France, 4,443 
         <line/>... Prussia, 563 
         <line/>... Switzerland, 465 
         <line/>... Denmark, 414 
         <line/>... Holland, 298 
         <line/>... Mexico, 797 
         <line/>... Texas, 698 
         <line/>... Cuba, 516 
         <line/>... Other countries, 2,152 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Some curious inferences might be drawn from this 
         <line/>table, as to the motives which induce men to leave 
         <line/>their native country. <i>Celeris paribus</i>, there is most 
         <line/>emigration where there is most intelligence. Thus, 
         <line/>Spain, Portugal, Sardinia, Naples, the Papal States, 
         <line/>and Austria, furnish no emigrants to American, while 
         <line/>Britain and Germany furnish a vast number. Much, 
         <line/>however, must depend on the domestic condition of 
         <line/>the country, and on the greater or less facilities for 
         <line/>removing. Thus, considering its inland position, and 
         <line/>the small number of its inhabitants, the spirit of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration must be much more active in Switzerland, 
         <line/>which sends out 445 persons, than in France, which 
         <line/>sends out 4443. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The magistrates of New York, it appears, con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sider the influx of emigrants a nuisance, and it 
         <line/>would seem, from an expression of Mr Buchanan's, the 
         <line/>agent at Quebec, that they had laid a tax of ten dol<sh/>
         
         <line/>lars upon all who arrive with an intention of settling. 
         <line/>The key to this proceeding is no doubt to be found in 
         <line/>the following facts. A Board of Aldermen reported in 
         <line/>June last, that the expense of City Almshouses in the 
         <line/>preceding year were 205,500 dollars, or &#x163;44,000 ; that 
         <line/>of 1209 persons admitted in a certain period, 932 were 
         <line/>aliens ; and that the whole number under the charge 
         <line/>of the Commissioners was 3074, of whom three-fourths 
         <line/>were foreigners. A communication from the Mayor 
         <line/>at the same time says:–" Nearly 2000 emigrants arrive 
         <line/>each week ; our streets are filled with the wandering 
         <line/>crowds of those passengers, clustering in our city, 
         <line/>unaccustomed to our climate, without money, without 
         <line/>employment, without friends, many not speaking our 
         <line/>language, without any dependence for food, or rainment[?], 
         <line/>or fireside." In Boston and Philadelphia, also, nearly 
         <line/>one-half of the inmates of the almshouses were foreign<sh/>
         
         <line/>ers.

         <line/>consequence, increased its exertions to conciliate the

         <line/>Separatists, who had resolved to emigrate from Austria 
         <line/>to Australia, because of the interference of Govern<sh/>

            <small_caps>Commission of the General Assembly</small_caps>
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Wednesday, the Commission of Assembly met in 
         <line/>the Tolbooth Church–Dr Muir, Moderator, in the 
         <line/>chair. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>The Presbyterian Church in New South Wales.</small_caps>
         
         <line/>–The Moderator recalled to the notice of the Commis<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion, that on a former meeting, they had directed him 
         <line/>to write to Lord Glenelg, Secretary for the Colonies, 
         <line/>disavowing connection with Dr Lang in New South 
         <line/>Wales, and blaming his proceedings in that colony, in 
         <line/>separating himself from the Presbytery there formed in 
         <line/>connection with the Church of Scotland. Since that 
         <line/>time he had had a communication from Lord Glenelg, 
         <line/>which he was sure would be received by the Commis<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion with great satisfaction. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The communication from Lord Glenelg was then 
         <line/>read. It consisted of a copy of the despatch transmit<sh/>
         
         <line/>ted to the Governor of New South Wales, approving 
         <line/>of his conduct in withholding the salaries of the Pres<sh/>
         
         <line/>byterian laymen who had not submitted themselves to 
         <line/>the authority of the Presbytery in connection with the 
         <line/>Church of Scotland, and further directing that Dr 
         <line/>Lang's salary should be discontinued. His lordship 
         <line/>explained, that in doing this the Government had no 
         <line/>wish to constitute themselves judges in any ecclesias<sh/>
         
         <line/>tical disputes ; but as the salaries awarded to these 
         <line/>gentlemen had been given on the faith that they were 
         <line/>to remain in connection with the Church of Scotland, 
         <line/>they could not be continued so long as they defied her 
         <line/>authority. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the motion of Mr Dunlop, the Commission una<sh/>
         
         <line/>nimously expressed their satisfaction with the prompti<sh/>
         
         <line/>tude and decision which the Government had shown 
         <line/>in the matter ; and directed the Moderator to commu<sh/>
         
         <line/>nicate their minute to Lord Glenelg. It was also agreed 
         <line/>to re-appoint the Committee to watch over the farther 
         <line/>proceedings, especially as it was understoof that Dr 
         <line/>Lang was now on his way to this country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Case of Small Isles.</small_caps>–The Commission, then pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>ceeded to take up the case of Small Isles, which, it will 
         <line/>be recollected, arose out of the Rev. Mr M'Lean hav<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing, as was alleged, appeared in the lobby of the As<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembly House, while that Court was sitting in May last, 
         <line/>in a state of intoxication. The case occupied the Court 
         <line/>a considerable part of the day; and at the evening 
         <line/>sederunt the following motion, by Dr Gardner, was una<sh/>
         
         <line/>nimously agreed to–That the Commission having con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sidered the evidence on the record, find, that in as far 
         <line/>as that evidence is hearsay, it is inadmissable; but find 
         <line/>it proved that on the afternoon of Friday the 25th of 
         <line/>May last, Mr M'Lean was seen in a state of intoxication 
         <line/>in the vestibule of the General Assembly, attempting 
         <line/>to force his way into it; that it is proved he was on two 
         <line/>other occasions during the sitting of last Assembly in a 
         <line/>state of intoxication; and, therefore, they find that he 
         <line/>ought to be deposed from the office of the holy minis<sh/>
         
         <line/>try, and direct the Moderator accordingly to pronounce 
         <line/>the sentence of deposition, directing the Clerk to trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>mit an extract of the sentence to the Presbytery of 
         <line/>Skye, and them to declare the parish of Small Isles 
         <line/>vacant.–The Moderator pronounced from the chair 
         <line/>the sentence os deposition. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Case of Lethendy.</small_caps>–In the course of the proceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings during the early sederunt of the Commission, the 
         <line/>Procurator rose and said, he might take the present 
         <line/>opportunity of stating to the Commission, that within 
         <line/>the last three or four days a petition and complaint had 
         <line/>been given in to the Court of Session, and appointed to 
         <line/>be served, at the instance of Mr Clark, presentee to the 
         <line/>parish of Lethendy, against the Presbytery of Dunkeld, 
         <line/>and Mr Kessen, whom that Presbytery had lately in<sh/>
         
         <line/>ducted into that charge, in despite of interdicts issued 
         <line/>by the Court of Session. He mentioned the fact to that 
         <line/>Commission, presuming that they would authorize him 
         <line/>to defend the Presbytery, who had acted under autho<sh/>
         
         <line/>rity of the Commission itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Buchanan of Glasgow, after some remarks in 
         <line/>commendation of the firmness of the Presbytery in carry<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing through the settlement amidst many difficulties, 
         <line/>moved that "The Commission sanction the Procu<sh/>
         
         <line/>rator's defending the Presbytery in the trying 
         <line/>circumstances in which they are placed, and resolve 
         <line/>that they will to the utmost of their power encourage 
         <line/>and support them under whatsoever difficulties they 
         <line/>may be subjected by their execution of the sentence 
         <line/>of the Commission ; and that the thanks of the Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>mission be given to the Presbytery for the decision and 
         <line/>temperate firmness with which they have practically 
         <line/>maintained the rightful authority and jurisdiction of 
         <line/>the Church."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Dr Bryce said, he was quite unprepared for any mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion on this subject; but with the views which he enter<sh/>
         
         <line/>tained in regard to this case, it was impossible he could 
         <line/>concur in the motion proposed, and he must therefore 
         <line/>dissent from it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr James Bridges expressed great indignation against 
         <line/>Mr Clark for thus bidding defiance to the authority of 
         <line/>the Church Courts, and he proposed, that for thus 
         <line/>trampling on the rights and dignity of the Church, Mr 
         <line/>Clark should be forthwith called before the Commission 
         <line/>for an exemplary punishment.–Mr Dunlop suggested, 
         <line/>that although he concurred in feeling with Mr Bridges, 
         <line/>it would be premature at present to take any steps 
         <line/>against Mr Clark, inasmuch as there was no official 
         <line/>communication on the subject from the Presbytery of 
         <line/>Dunkeld. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Makgill recommended to Mr Bridges, for this 
         <line/>reason, not to press his motion, declaring, that as at 
         <line/>this time 200 years ago eight Bishops had been de<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed, he trusted the time was not far distant when Mr 
         <line/>Clark would receive a similar reward for his misconduct; 
         <line/>and Mr M. said emphatically, that whatever the Pres<sh/>
         
         <line/>bytery of Dunkeld might suffer for upholding the inde<sh/>
         
         <line/>pendence of the Church, he, as a member of Commis<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion, by whose orders they had acted, would be proud to 
         <line/>bear his share. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr bridges then intimated, that he would waive 
         <line/>pressing his motion, and Mr Buchanan's was adopted, 
         <line/>Dr Bryce and Mr W. Malcolm intimating their dissent, 
         <line/>on the ground that it was incompetent and inexpedient 
         <line/>for the Commission to adopt such a resolution.

         <line/>
            <small_caps>Celebrated Assembly at Glasgow.</small_caps>–In the course 
         <line/>of the day, the Moderator suggested, that as this was 
         <line/>the second centenary of the great Assembly at Glas<sh/>
         
         <line/>gow, which might be considered as the founder, not 
         <line/>only of their ecclesiastical but of their civil liverties, 
         <line/>a meeting should be held, exclusively devoted to prayer 
         <line/>and thanksgiving to Almighty God for the benefits con<sh/>
         
         <line/>ferred on their Zion. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At seven o'clock accordingly, several of the mem<sh/>
         
         <line/>bers, and a considerable number of people assembled, 
         <line/>when an hour was spent in devotional exercises, which 
         <line/>were conducted by Drs Muir, Lee, and Dickson, in 
         <line/>succession. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Commission adjourned to the second Tuesday in 
         <line/>February next.

         <line/>very few collections–this being the third plant of the 
         <line/>kind that has flowered in Great Britain. It is one of 
         <line/>the four plants which were sent from New Holland to 
         <line/>the Duchess of Atholl, twelve years ago, and the only 
         <line/>one that has survived the voyage. The seapus or 
         <line/>stem is upwards of twelve feet in heigh, from the top 
         <line/>of which diverge seven stalks, each bearing nine large 
         <line/>flowers of a deep crimson and pink colour. The for<sh/>

         <line/>sociation for the Promotion of Emigration to South 
         <line/>Australia. In rank and numbers it was not surpassed. 
         <line/>There could not be less than two thousand persons in 
         <line/>the room. Colonel Torrens dwelt at considerable 
         <line/>length on the causes of Irish misery, and proved fully, 
         <line/>at least to our satisfaction, that a powerful and effi<sh/>
         
         <line/>cacious remedy was applicable in the objects of the 
         <line/>meeting. The subject seemed to tell powerfully on 
         <line/>the meeting ; the speakers were heard with great at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tention, and the applauses they received told that the 
         <line/>public feeling was deeply identified with the future 
         <line/>colony of New Ireland.

         <line/>for New South Wales, by the Palmyra, drew from his

         <line/>to look to his affairs before the sailing of the vessel. 
         <line/>The wounded man was taken to the Infirmary in a

         <line/>It appears that the young man has for some time past

         <line/>The woodland wild ! –where the hazels grow, 
         <line/>Where the ladye-broom doth its branches throw,– 
         <line/>Where the God-built sky is in patches seen 
         <line/>Through the roof of leaves. There aye hath been 
         <line/>The home of those wild and fairy flowers 
         <line/>That gladden all Nature's life and ours, 
         <line/>As they bloom by the stream,–that prattling child, 
         <line/>That wanders along through the woodland wild ! 
         <line/>The woodland wild !–If thy heart be pure, 
         <line/>If thy faith in the right be firm and sure, 
         <line/>Go, wander the woodlands parth within, 
         <line/>And the love of Nature woo and win; 
         <line/>Drink of the cup of beauty there, 
         <line/>Where the breath of Omnipotence scents the air; 
         <line/>For the Father of beauty in love hath smiled 
         <line/>On the sweet green bowers of the woodland wild 
         <line/>The woodlan wild !–long, long ago, 
         <line/>I have buried myself its leaves below, 
         <line/>And dreamed of its beauteous tenants all,– 
         <line/>'Tis the linnet's home and fairies' hall! 
         <line/>'Tis the spot where the wondrous monk of old, 
         <line/>His hermitage reared in the pleasant wold; 
         <line/>By its door a crystal springlet boiled, 
         <line/>For the pilgrim to drink, in the woodlan wild! 
         <line/>The woodland wild !–what pleasant stories 
         <line/>Make sunlight over its olden glories,– 
         <line/>Of Robin Hood and his bowmen bold, 
         <line/>The raids they made, and the tales they told ! 
         <line/>In winter, in spring, and in summer time, 
         <line/>The glorious forests are aye in prime ; 
         <line/>For glad thoughts forever are round them piled, 
         <line/>Those grassy glades in the woodland wild! 
         <line/>The woodland wild!–make haste.–make haste! 
         <line/>Away with me, and its gladness taste; 
         <line/>We will wander beside each gushing stream, 
         <line/>Where flowers in the water reflected gleam; 
         <line/>We will follow its paths and pluck its flowers, 
         <line/>And lie on its grass in the evening hours, 
         <line/>Till the dying sunlight, soft and mild, 
         <line/>Warns us away from the woodland wild !

            <small_caps>Afflicting Case of Destitution.</small_caps>–Some 
         <line/>time ago a vessel was advertised to sail from this port 
         <line/>for Australia, and to take out Government settlers free 
         <line/>of expense. A family in Shetland, consisting of the 
         <line/>husband, wife, and six of a young family, sold off their 
         <line/>effects and came to Leith for the purpose of availing 
         <line/>themselves of this opportunity to settle in the above 
         <line/>colony. On applying to the agent, however, they were 
         <line/>informed that they did not come under the description 
         <line/>of persons wanted. Since, therefore, they have 
         <line/>lived in Leith till their little all has been exhausted, 
         <line/>and the husband, from the combined effects of disap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pointment and want, has been thrown upon a sick-bed, 
         <line/>and the whole family are literally in a state of starvation. 
         <line/>Several private individuals, with a benevolence that 
         <line/>does them the highest credit, have temporarily sup<sh/>
         
         <line/>plied their wants ; but the hands of private charity is 
         <line/>soon crippled, and unless something else be immedi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ately done, we may have soon to report one or more of 
         <line/>their deaths from the actual want of the necessaries of 
         <line/>life. The object of the present notice therefore is to 
         <line/>draw forth the sympathies of the charitable, to relive a 
         <line/>family thus suddenly involved in want and misery, who, 
         <line/>from their industrious habits and every way excellent 
         <line/>characters, left their native home with the good wishes 
         <line/>of all their friends. Any donations, either in money 
         <line/>or clothes, will be thankfully received by Mr Andrew 
         <line/>Spence, of the firm of Messrs Cunninham &amp; Spence, 
         <line/>No. 62, Tolbooth-wynd, Leith.

            <small_caps>New Zealand–Name of the Capital City.</small_caps>
         
         <line/>ߝIt will gratify the admirers of the Duke of Welling<sh/>
         
         <line/>ton to learn, that the Directors of the New Zealand 
         <line/>Company have resolved that the name of the city 
         <line/>founded by Colonel Wakefield, Lambton Harbour, 
         <line/>Port Nicholson, and which is destined to become the 
         <line/>capital of New Zealand, shall be named "The City 
         <line/>of Wellington," in honour of the illustrious Duke. 
         <line/>The Duke is a great advocate for colonization, and to 
         <line/>him the promoters of colonization of South Aus<sh/>
         
         <line/>tralia were in a great measure indebted for securing 
         <line/>the enactment of the statute which gave effect to the 
         <line/>principles on which that colony is founded ; and, as many 
         <line/>of the promoters of South Australian emigration are Di<sh/>
         
         <line/>rectors of the New Zealand Company, they have re<sh/>
         
         <line/>solved, setting all party politics aside, to confer this ho<sh/>
         
         <line/>nour on the Duke. There could be no stronger proof of 
         <line/>the political sagacity and statesmanlike views of the 
         <line/>Duke, than his approval of the Wakefield system 
         <line/>of colonization, and no better mode of perpetuating 
         <line/>his name than by bestowing it on the metropolis of the 
         <line/>"Great Britain of the Southern Hemisphere."/&gt;

            <small_caps>Deputation of Distressed Weavers.</small_caps>–The 
         <line/>distress of the Paisley weavers has caused them to 
         <line/>send a deputation to London, which, on Tuesday, 
         <line/>waited on Lord John Russell, to solicit the means of 
         <line/>transporting themselves out of the ungrateful country 
         <line/>which has been enriched by their toils, and, in return, 
         <line/>refuses them the means of subsistence. Their prayer 
         <line/>was to be sent to New Zealand. The answer was, 
         <line/>that Government will, next session, bring forward 
         <line/>some general measure on the subject, but in the mean 
         <line/>time cannot help them.

         <line/>Narrative of a Whaling Voyage Round 
         <line/>The Globe &amp;c. &amp;c By Frederick Debell 
         <line/>Bennett, Esq., F.R.G.S. 2 vols. London: 
         <line/>Richard Bentley. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We have been somewhat disappointed in these 
         <line/>volumes. We expected to have found them, like 
         <line/>Scoresby's, full of interesting details regarding 
         <line/>whale fishing, whereas, there is hardly a word on 
         <line/>the subject throughout the whole of the first vo<sh/>
         
         <line/>lume, and very little in the second ; in fact, what 
         <line/>there is, is confined to a sort of supplementary ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>pendix. This is the more strange, that one of the 
         <line/>chief purposes of the author, as he himself informs 
         <line/>us, in undertaking this voyage, was to investigate 
         <line/>the anatomy and habits of southern whales, and 
         <line/>the mode of conducting the sperm whale fishery, 
         <line/>subjects which, he remarks, were then untouched 
         <line/>by the literature of any country. Yet, in the 
         <line/>work itself, this chief purpose dwindles into one 
         <line/>of very secondary prominence. This, the readers 
         <line/>of the work, at least most of them, will the more 
         <line/>regret, on finding how very curious and interest<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing are the two or three chapters which the author 
         <line/>has given on the subejct of South Sea whaling. 
         <line/>There are full of entertaining details of both a 
         <line/>popular and scientific character, and cannot be 
         <line/>read without exciting a wish that larger portion 
         <line/>of the work had been composed of such material. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In making these remarks, however, we are far 
         <line/>from intending to depreciate the sort of informa<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion, in the shape chiefly of sketches of the South 
         <line/>Sea Islands, to which the greater part of the vo<sh/>
         
         <line/>lumes are devoted ; we mean merely to say, that 
         <line/>it is not what we expected from the title of the 
         <line/>work, nor, we may add, what, for our own reading, 
         <line/>we should have preferred. Yet are these sketches 
         <line/>very amusing reading–full of graphic descriptions 
         <line/>and curious details of native character, which is 
         <line/>still found in the South Sea Islands in a state of 
         <line/>very primitive simplicity. "We have frequently 
         <line/>seen," says Mr Bennett, " amongst the congrega<sh/>
         
         <line/>gation assembled at Church (in Raiatea), a native 
         <line/>clothed in nothing but a shirt ; another with a 
         <line/>beaver hat surmounting a person naked except 
         <line/>the scanty maro ; and a third, whose whole attire 
         <line/>was a black coat, white neckerchief, and a shirt!"/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We observe a rather odd circumstance noted 
         <line/>by Mr Bennett. He says that the " temperate 
         <line/>ships" of America are the principal purveyors of 
         <line/>ardent spirits to the natives of the South Sea 
         <line/>Islands, carrying large quantities of rum thither 
         <line/>for the purposes of traffic! This is placing the 
         <line/>temperance principle in a somewhat curious pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>dicament. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Another remark of the author's not less strik<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing–mark it well and take comfort from it ye 
         <line/>
            <i>bon vivants[?]</i> of the civilzed world–is, that disease 
         <line/>is as abundant amongst the native islanders as 
         <line/>amongst the most refined of their species, and from 
         <line/>this concludes, that man in his savage state is as 
         <line/>liable to the " ills that flesh is heir to," as in his 
         <line/>civilised condition. Dr Johnson made a similar 
         <line/>remark regarding the Highlanders of Scotland ; 
         <line/>alleging that the London alderman lived as long 
         <line/>over his turtle feast, as the Highlander over his 
         <line/>paten cake. What degree of fellow-feeling with 
         <line/>civic dignitary and his good living, or whether 
         <line/>any, dictated this remark of the learned doctor, 
         <line/>we cannot say. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Mr Bennett's work is written with great ability, 
         <line/>and in style whose only fault is exhibited in a 
         <line/>tendency, occasionally, to the use of rather learned 
         <line/>phraseology. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We conclude with an extract from that portion 
         <line/>of the work which, from its great interest, we 
         <line/>regretted was not larger, but which, limited 
         <line/>as it is, is so full of curious information, and so 
         <line/>crowded with remarkable incident, as to render 
         <line/>the selection by no means an easy task. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Some sperm whales appear reluctant to employ 
         <line/>their tail when attacked, but prove active and danger<sh/>
         
         <line/>ous with their jaws. Such individuals often rather seek 
         <line/>than avoid the attacking boats, and, rushing upon them 
         <line/>with open mouth, employ every possible art to crush 
         <line/>them with their teeth, and, if successful, will sometimes 
         <line/>continue in their neighbourhood, biting the wreck and 
         <line/>oars into small fragments. When thus threatening a 
         <line/>boat, the whale usually turns and swings upon its back, 
         <line/>and will sometimes act in a very sluggish and unac<sh/>
         
         <line/>countable manner, keeping its formidable lower jaw 
         <line/>suspended for some moments over the boat, in a threat<sh/>
         
         <line/>ening attitude, but ultimately rolling to one side, and 
         <line/>closing its mouth harmlessly ; nor is it rare to observe 
         <line/>this whale, when pursued and attacked, retain[?] its mouth 
         <line/>in an expanded state for some minutes together. Such 
         <line/>threatening demonstrations of the jaw, as well as some 
         <line/>others with the flukes, occasionally compel a boat's 
         <line/>crew to leap into the water, and support themselves 
         <line/>by swimming or clinging to oars until the danger has 
         <line/>passed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"In the year 1835, the ship Pusie Hall encountered 
         <line/>a fighting whale, which after injuring and driving off 
         <line/>her four boats, pursued them to the ship, and withstood 
         <line/>for some time the lances hurled at it, by the crew, from 
         <line/>the bows of the vessel, before in could be induced to 
         <line/>retire ; in this affair a youth in one of the boats was 
         <line/>destroyed by a blow from the whale, and one of the 
         <line/>officers was severely lacerated by coming in contact 
         <line/>with the animal's jaw. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"A highly tragical instances of the power and fero<sh/>
         
         <line/>city occasionally displayed by the sperm whale, is re<sh/>
         
         <line/>corded in the fate of the American South-Seaman 
         <line/>Essex, Captain G. Pollard. This vessel, when cruis<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing in the Pacific Ocean, in the year 1820, was wrecked 
         <line/>by a whale under the following extraordinary circum<sh/>
         
         <line/>stances. The boats had been lowered in pursuit of a 
         <line/>school of whales, and the ship was attending them to 
         <line/>windward. The master and second mate were engaged 
         <line/>with whales they had harpooned, in the midst of the 
         <line/>school, and the chief mate had returned on board to 
         <line/>equip a spare boat, in lieu of his own, which had been 
         <line/>broken and rendered unserviceable. While the crew 
         <line/>were thus occupied, the look-out at the masthead re<sh/>
         
         <line/>ported that a large whale was coming rapidly down 
         <line/>upon the ship, the mate hastened his task, in the 
         <line/>hope that he might be ready in time to attack it. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"The Cachalot, which was of the largest size, con<sh/>
         
         <line/>sequently a male, and probably the guardian of the 
         <line/>school, in the meanwhile approached the ship so closely, 
         <line/>that the although the helm was put up to avoid the con<sh/>
         
         <line/>tact, he struck her a severe blow, which broke off a 
         <line/>portion of her keel. The enraged animal was then ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>served to retire to some distance, and again rush upon 
         <line/>the ship with extreme velocity. His enormous head 
         <line/>struck the starboard bow, beating in a corresponding 
         <line/>portion of the planks, and the people on board had 
         <line/>barely time to take to their boats, before the ship filled 
         <line/>with water and fell over on her side. She did not sink, 
         <line/>however, for some hours ; and the crew in the boats 
         <line/>continued near the wreck until they had obtained a 
         <line/>small supply of provisions, when they shaped a course 
         <line/>for land ; but here, it is to be regretted, they made a 
         <line/>fatal error. At the time the accident happened they 
         <line/>were cruising on the Equator, in the longitude of about 
         <line/>118[?] degrees West, with the Marquesan and Society 
         <line/>Islands on their lee, and might have sailed in their 
         <line/>boats to either of those groups in a comparatively short 
         <line/>time. Under an erroneous impression, however, that 
         <line/>all those lands were inhabited by an inhospitable race 
         <line/>of people, they preferred pulling to windward for the 
         <line/>coast of Peru, and in the attempt were exposed for a 
         <line/>lengthened period in extreme privations."/&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>A few Cachalots have been noted individually as 
         <line/>animals dangerous to attack. One was thus distin<sh/>
         
         <line/>guished on the cruising ground off the coast of New 
         <line/>Zealand, and was long know to whalers by the name 
         <line/>of 'New Zealand Tom.' He is said to have been of 
         <line/>great size, conspicuously distinguished by a white 
         <line/>hump ; and famous for the havoc he had made amongst 
         <line/>the boats and gear of ships attempting his destruction. 
         <line/>A second example, of cimilar celebrity, was known to 
         <line/>whalers in the Straits of Timor. He had so often 
         <line/>succeeded in repelling the attacks of his foes as to be 
         <line/>considered invincible, but was at length despatched by 
         <line/>a whaler, who, forewarned of his combative temper, 
         <line/>adopted the expedient of floating a cask on the sea, to 
         <line/>withdraw his attention from the boats ; but notwith<sh/>
         
         <line/>standing this <i>ruse</i> the animal was not destroyed with<sh/>
         
         <line/>out much hard fighting, nor until the bow of one of 
         <line/>the boats had been nipped off by his jaws."/&gt;

      <p>
         <line/>(<i>From the Glasgow Argus.</i>) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On Monday night a public meeting, chiefly com<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed of the working classes, was held in the Justi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ciary Court Hall, Glasgow, for the purpose of memo<sh/>
         
         <line/>rializing Lord John Russell in favour of obtaining 
         <line/>the Lord Provost in the chair. The hall was crowded 
         <line/>to excess, and it was perfectly evident from the first that 
         <line/>the Chartists had mustered in great strength to carry 
         <line/>out their usual course of obstruction to the particular 
         <line/>business of the evening.–Mr T. Gillespie proposed a 
         <line/>resolution in favour of emigration to New Zealand 
         <line/>through the medium of funds raised by the sale of 
         <line/>lands in the colony, and addressed the meeting at 
         <line/>some length in support of the resolution.–Mr R. Malcolm, jun. 
         <line/>a young lad, and a Chartist spouter, after a long 
         <line/>speech, proposed an amendment; to the effect that 
         <line/>while the meeting was favourable to emigration to New 
         <line/>Zealand, or any other part of the world, by those so 
         <line/>disposed, they objected to any application being 
         <line/>made for a grant of public money for any such pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>pose–that they were opposed to the question of emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration being allowed to occupy public attention, &amp;c. 
         <line/>and concluded with the statement that emigration 
         <line/>would not afford even temporary relief to the oppressed 
         <line/>operatives, and that bad laws were the chief cause of 
         <line/>all their present sufferings, &amp;c. This amendment 
         <line/>which was supported by the most trifling arguments 
         <line/>we ever heard brought forward in public, was of 
         <line/>course loudly cheered by the Chartists. The Lord 
         <line/>Provost repeatedly explained that he had agreed to 
         <line/>take the chair on the understanding that the subject 
         <line/>of emigration to New Zealand was to occupy the atten<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion ; but here a matter, perfectly foreign to the busi<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness for which they were convened, was introduced by 
         <line/>way of amendment ; there was an attack made upon 
         <line/>the general policy of the country–and he had posi<sh/>
         
         <line/>tively to state that, if such an amendment was carried, 
         <line/>he would not remain in the chair. This was received 
         <line/>by cries for "a new chairman" and much confusion, 
         <line/>one party cheering, and the other hissing and yelling 
         <line/>alternately during the greater part of the evening. A 
         <line/>discussion followed, in which a boy named Jack took 
         <line/>a prominent part ; and it became perfectly evident that 
         <line/>the Chartist speakers were woefully ignorant of the 
         <line/>subject they had the impudence to discuss. It was 
         <line/>gravely and indignantly averred, that by going to New 
         <line/>Zealand, the working men would incur the risk of 
         <line/>being swallowed by cannibals! Till informed of the 
         <line/>contrary, the Chartists seemed to think that the means 
         <line/>of emigration were to be supplied from the public ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>chequer ; and when told that the funds were to be 
         <line/>raised by the sale of lands in New Zealand, one of 
         <line/>them sagely observed that it would be much more 
         <line/>humane and just to appropriate the proceeds of those 
         <line/>sales of land to employ it in sending out emigrants ! 
         <line/>Another favourite argument was, that every person 
         <line/>had a right to subsist in the land that gave him 
         <line/>birth, and that it was barbarous and cruel to send 
         <line/>a man, however wretched, out of his native 
         <line/>country ; also, that emigration would produce no 
         <line/>benefit to society at home, as the places of those 
         <line/>sent off would soon be filled by others. Of 
         <line/>course, if these arguments had always been held 
         <line/>good, and acted upon, the whole human family would, 
         <line/>to this day, have been crowded together in the cradle 
         <line/>of our race in the East, provided only the thing had 
         <line/>been possible; the extension of mankind to other parts 
         <line/>of the world must have been wicked, and cruel, and 
         <line/>useless–for "for every inhabitant of a country is entitled 
         <line/>to a subsistence in the land that gave him birth," and, 
         <line/>on his removal to another land, his place would just be 
         <line/>filled by others ! The above is a mere specimen of 
         <line/>the worse than childish arguments used by the Chartist 
         <line/>spouters, and which the men who are now " knocking 
         <line/>loudly at the door of the constitution for admission,"/&gt;
         <line/>cheered as if they had been fraught with the choicest 
         <line/>wisdom !–Mr John Crawford, Secretary to the New 
         <line/>Zealand Land Company, endeavoured, by some sensible 
         <line/>remarks, to place the question of emigration to New 
         <line/>Zealand on its proper footing ; but in vain ; they were 
         <line/>determined to have the charter only–and till then 
         <line/>starving workmen, willing, but unable, to emigrate, 
         <line/>must starve on. On a division, the amendment pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed by Mr Malcolm was carried by a large majority, 
         <line/>and, after a vote of thanks had been given to the Lord 
         <line/>Provost, the meeting broke up. This was not done, 
         <line/>however, till the Chartists were called upon to be at 
         <line/>their posts at the meeting to be held to-day to address 
         <line/>the Queen–to render themselves, of course, a little 
         <line/>more odious by another stretch of their obstructive 
         <line/>power–if they can.

         <line/>On Monday a discussion of some interest took 
         <line/>place in the House of Commons relative to the 
         <line/>affairs of South Australia. Owing to certain de<sh/>
         
         <line/>fects in its government, that colony has fallen 
         <line/>into a state of financial embarassment requiring 
         <line/>immediate relief. Lord John Russell traced the 
         <line/>history of the settlement from its foundation, and 
         <line/>stated that, while its revenue does not exceed 
         <line/>&#x163;20,000 its expenditure has increased to the 
         <line/>enormous sum of &#x163;130,000 a year ! At present 
         <line/>its affairs are managed by commissioners, the re<sh/>
         
         <line/>sponsible Ministers of the Crown having no di<sh/>
         
         <line/>rect control over its expenditure. This is mani<sh/>
         
         <line/>festly an evil, and must form the subject of future 
         <line/>legislation, but in the meantime it is necessary to 
         <line/>provide for the payment of certain bills now 
         <line/>over-due. Accordingly, Lord John Russell pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>posed that her Majesty should be authorized to 
         <line/>guarantee a loan of &#x163;210,000 for this purpose. 
         <line/>Lord Stanley concurred generally in the views of 
         <line/>the noble Secretary for the Colonies, but though 
         <line/>that the Government ought not to demand a 
         <line/>loan until they had brought in a bill to explain 
         <line/>distinctly the principles on which they proposed 
         <line/>that the colony should henceforth be governed. 
         <line/>Sir Robert Peel suggested that the Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment should ask a vote of credit for the sum re<sh/>
         
         <line/>quired, which, as it met the urgency of the case, 
         <line/>was ultimately agreed upon, and the subject was 
         <line/>deferred till Friday.

            <small_caps>Mr Grote</small_caps> rose to move a series of resolutions in con<sh/>
         
         <line/>demnation of the application of a part of the Land and Emi<sh/>
         
         <line/>gration Fund of New South Wales to the maintenance of 
         <line/>gaols and police in that colony. It was in 1831 that this ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pense, antecedently borne by the Home Government, was 
         <line/>for the first time thrown upon the colony, whose revenues 
         <line/>were then found to yield considerable surplus of revenue 
         <line/>beyond expenditure. The charge so imposed at that time was 
         <line/>calculated to be about &#x163;25,000 a year ; and had that been all 
         <line/>the colony would have borne it without a murmur; but in 
         <line/>fact it had ever since averaged nearly &#x163;60,000. It was not 
         <line/>reasonable to impose such a charge on the colony, on account 
         <line/>of gaols and police, constituted not the ordinary uses of 
         <line/>a colonial society, but for the peculiar purposes of our trans<sh/>
         
         <line/>portation system. The argument urged by the Home Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment was, that the expense was chiefly caused by the extensive 
         <line/>distribution of convicts by assignment throughout the colony, 
         <line/>whose settlers drew a proportional profit from the labour so 
         <line/>assigned. But that assignment was a gain, not more to the 
         <line/>colonists, who obtained the labour, than to the mother country, 
         <line/>which saved the expense of maintaing the labourers. What<sh/>
         
         <line/>ever value the mother country might be entitled to claim 
         <line/>for the labour of the convicts, ought in strictness to fall, not 
         <line/>on the colony at large, but on the individual employers; and 
         <line/>if there were valid reasons against an exaction of premium 
         <line/>from them, still it was unjust to throw the obligation upon 
         <line/>the colony at large. That was to pay private wages out of 
         <line/>public rates. This one charge on the oclony was sufficient 
         <line/>on account for all that embarassment in its finances which 
         <line/>had been growing for the last six years. It had been enabled 
         <line/>to defray the impact, only by resorting to the emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion fund, and thus checking emigration itself. No 
         <line/>less than &#x163;260,000 had been abstracted from that fund to 
         <line/>meet these costs of jails and police. The diversion of that 
         <line/>fund from emigration was a great evil, both to the colony, 
         <line/>where labour is so pressingly needed, and to the poor of this 
         <line/>country, to whom that refuge is so material. He considered 
         <line/>the emigration fund as held by the Government in trust for 
         <line/>the united intersts of the colony and of the mother country. 
         <line/>The great extent of sales of land in the colony had been 
         <line/>[?] owing to the belief of the colonists that the proceed<sh/>
         
         <line/>[?] would be applied to emigration. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The hon. member was proceeding to cite the opinions of 
         <line/>various persons in favour of this strict application, when a mo<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion was made to count the House, and it adjourned for want 
         <line/>of its quorum[?] of 40 members.

      <p>
         <line/>We have received a copy of a Series of Resolu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions passed, on the 23d of October 1840, by the 
         <line/>Legislative Cuncil of New South Wales, on the 
         <line/>subject of immigration into colony. The 
         <line/>object of these resolutions is to encourage emigra<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion from the mother country, by showing the 
         <line/>demand for labour in New South Wales, and the 
         <line/>advantages offered to the immigrant. We have 
         <line/>only room for a few of the more important resolu<sh/>
         
         <line/>tions :ߝ 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved. That there exists throughout the colony 
         <line/>an urgent and increasing want of working hands, in 
         <line/>every branch of industry ; that there is ample employ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment for emigrants, at highly renumerating wages 
         <line/>without the interruption, in this mild climate, experi<sh/>
         
         <line/>enced in colder countries during the winter months ; 
         <line/>and that, even during the worst period of the past 
         <line/>severe drought, no persons able and willing to work 
         <line/>found any difficult in procuring advantageous employ<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved. That, in the opinion of this Council, there 
         <line/>can be no more advantageous field for the employment 
         <line/>of industry than is presented in New South Wales– 
         <line/>experience proving, that able-bodied, sober, indus<sh/>
         
         <line/>trious and careful emigrants may, within a few years 
         <line/>after their arrival, rise form the condition of labourers 
         <line/>to be themselves employers of labour; by which pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>cess, and by the progressive increase of the flocks and 
         <line/>herds of the colony, a constant demand for additional 
         <line/>labourers is created, sufficient to remove all apprehen<sh/>
         
         <line/>sion of a dearth of employment for as many as may 
         <line/>arise. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved. That this Council would particulary in<sh/>
         
         <line/>stance the large and increasing sums at the credit of 
         <line/>the working classes in the Savings Bank of New South 
         <line/>Wales, as affording gratifying evidence of their pros<sh/>
         
         <line/>perous condition, the deposits having increased from 
         <line/>&#x163;24,469, the amount on 31st December 1835, to &#x163;127,000 
         <line/>on 31st August 1840. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved. That great additiona advantage must 
         <line/>accrue to the mother country from the large consump<sh/>
         
         <line/>tion in this colony of British produce and manufac<sh/>
         
         <line/>tures, the declared value of which, from 1826 to 1839, 
         <line/>according to the official returns for that period, 
         <line/>amounted to more than eight millions sterling, having 
         <line/>progressively increased from &#x163;280,000, the amount in 
         <line/>1826, to &#x163;1,251,969 in 1839 ; whilst the exports from 
         <line/>the colony, including the produce of the fisheries, in<sh/>
         
         <line/>creased from &#x163;106,600 in the former year, to &#x163;948,776 
         <line/>in the latter–the total amount being &#x163;6,187,530 for the 
         <line/>whole period. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Resolved. That the trade between the mother coun<sh/>
         
         <line/>try and this colony, together with the whale fisheries 
         <line/>in the adjourning seas, also affords a valuable nursery 
         <line/>for seamen, important in this respect, in proportion to 
         <line/>the distance from Great Britain, and calculated to 
         <line/>strengthen and secure her maritime power ; and that 
         <line/>this field for the employment of British shipping must 
         <line/>increase with the growing prosperity of the colony– 
         <line/>considerations which appear to this Council to consti<sh/>
         
         <line/>tute a strong additional claim, on the part of the colony, 
         <line/>to the fostering care of the British Government.

            <small_caps>Emigration to New Zealand.</small_caps>–On Friday the 
         <line/>Tyne left the London Dock, and proceeded down the 
         <line/>river on her voyage to Port Nicholson, New Zealand. 
         <line/>The Tyne is a fine new vessel, and she takes out 50 
         <line/>mechanics and labourers, with their families, from the 
         <line/>Emigration Depot at Deptford, besides a number of 
         <line/>other passengers, amongst whom are Mr Swainson, 
         <line/>Chief Justice, and Mr Martin, Attorney-General, of 
         <line/>the new colony, to which sations they have been re<sh/>
         
         <line/>cently appointed. The arrangements for the comfort 
         <line/>of the emigrants on board were certainly very com<sh/>
         
         <line/>plete ; and it must be gratifying to know that those 
         <line/>persons sent out by the company will be provided 
         <line/>with a large proportion of their provisions fresh, a

         <line/>A very lively and interesting scene occurred on Fri<sh/>
         
         <line/>day, off the West India Dock entrance, at Blackwall, 
         <line/>by the preparation for departure of three fine vessels 
         <line/>with "improvers" for "Nelson," the second colony of 
         <line/>New Zealand. The Directors of the Company and 
         <line/>several hundred persons of rank and wealth met there 
         <line/>to bid farewell to the enterprising emigrants, who ap<sh/>
         
         <line/>peared highly delighted with the honour extended to 
         <line/>them, and in high spirits with the anticipations of the 
         <line/>successful result of their mission. After viewing the 
         <line/>arrangeents made for the comfort of all on board, 
         <line/>the Directors returned to the West India Dock Tavern, 
         <line/>where a sumptuous breakfast was provided in the large 
         <line/>room. The Duke of Sussex took the chair, and was 
         <line/>supported on the right by the Earl of Devon, and on 
         <line/>the left by Jos. Somes, Esq., the Governor of the Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>pany. Among the guests were the Duchess of Inver<sh/>
         
         <line/>ness, the Duke and Duchess of Somerset, Lords Cot<sh/>
         
         <line/>tenham, Sandon, Marcus Hill, Clements, Viscount 
         <line/>Ebrington, M.P., the Hon. Frederick Dundas, Hon. 
         <line/>Captain Drummon, Messrs P. Maxwell Stewart, M.P., 
         <line/>Gowen, G. F. Young, W. C. Young, and the Misses 
         <line/>Young; the Hon. Mrs Douglas, the Hon. Miss Petre, 
         <line/>Rev, Dr Hinds, J. E. Boulcott, Captain Hine, Sir Ro<sh/>
         
         <line/>bert and Lady Harland, Sir John Doxatt, M. D.; Mr, 
         <line/>Mrs, and Miss Pennington; Lieutenant Lean, her Ma<sh/>
         
         <line/>jesty's Emigration Agent; MEssrs Jordan, E. G. Wake<sh/>
         
         <line/>field, Dudley Costello, Mr and Mrs S. C. Brees, Captain 
         <line/>Sinclair, R.N.,&amp;c. &amp;c. The rapid progress which the 
         <line/>grand undertaking of colonizing New Zealand has 
         <line/>made, was more than once alluded to by his Royal 
         <line/>Highness and other distinguished speakers on both 
         <line/>sides of politics, and its many advantages were dwelt 
         <line/>upon with much sincerity of feeling. Several gentle<sh/>
         
         <line/>men of the first families go out with this expedition, 
         <line/>which will be closely followed by several first-rate 
         <line/>ships.

            <small_caps>Theatre Royal.</small_caps>–The Pantomine, we ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>serve, is postponed till Friday. Meanwhile, the 
         <line/>theatre is crowded nightly, the public being ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>mitted at second price from the commencement 
         <line/>of the performances.

            <small_caps>Music Hall.</small_caps>–We stated, about two month 
         <line/>ago, that, in connection with other improvements 
         <line/>in the Assembly Rooms, a plan was under consi<sh/>
         
         <line/>deration for erecting a Music Hall. We are now 
         <line/>happy to announce, that at a meeting of the pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>prietors of the Rooms last week, full pwers were 
         <line/>given to the Directors to take the requisite steps 
         <line/>for carrying the design into execution. The de<sh/>
         
         <line/>sire so long felt by the cultivators of music here, 
         <line/>will soon be realisd, by the erection of a splendid 
         <line/>hall, constructed with a due regard to the accom<sh/>
         
         <line/>modation both of professional men and the public, 
         <line/>and with a minute attention to the most recent 
         <line/>improvements, by which full effect is secured to 
         <line/>musical performances when conducted on a grand 
         <line/>scale. By what may be called a propitious coin<sh/>
         
         <line/>cidence, Mr Bishop, the new Professor of Music, 
         <line/>arrived in Edinburgh on the very day when this 
         <line/>resolution was come to.

            <small_caps>Martin's Paintings.</small_caps>–The exhibition of 
         <line/>these celebrated paintings in this city has already, 
         <line/>we believe, attracted many visitors. They are 
         <line/>truly wonderful creations, and possess a power 
         <line/>and grandeur of which the engravings, so familiar 
         <line/>to the public, convey but a faint conception. In 
         <line/>contemplating " the Deluge," the spectator is so 
         <line/>[?] [?] [?] 
         <line/>the scene, that he is apt to overlook the details; 
         <line/>but these will be found on inspection to be among 
         <line/>the most interesting features of the picture. The 
         <line/>groups of perishing beings are exquisitely wrought, 
         <line/>while everything is made to contribute to the 
         <line/>terrific grandeur of the catastrophe. The other 
         <line/>two pictures–"Pandemonium" and "the Rivers 
         <line/>of Bliss," are smaller in size, but equally indica<sh/>
         
         <line/>tive of the high poetic genius of the artist. No<sh/>
         
         <line/>thing could be more striking than the contrast 
         <line/>these pictures present to each other–the one fear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ful beyond expression, the other exhibiting a 
         <line/>heavenly serenity and loveliness on which the 
         <line/>eye rests with delight. There are several other 
         <line/>valuable paintings in this collection, amongst 
         <line/>which is "The Offering Up of Isaac," a Rem<sh/>
         
         <line/>brandt in fine preservation.

            <small_caps>Gordon's British Diorama.</small_caps>–This beautiful 
         <line/>exhibition opened on Saturday last, and has, we 
         <line/>understand, been crowded with visitors ever since. 
         <line/>It will be seen by Mr Gordon's advertisement in 
         <line/>to-day's paper, that the view of the Tower of 
         <line/>London during the recent conflagration (to which 
         <line/>we alluded in our last) has now arrived, and is 
         <line/>being exhibited along with the other views.

            <small_caps>Broughton-place Congregation</small_caps>.–We 
         <line/>understand that the call given by Broughton<sh/>
         
         <line/> Place Congregation to the Rev. Mr Croon, San<sh/>
         
         <line/>quhar, to be colleague to the Rev. Dr. Brown, 
         <line/>has not been accepted, owing to the strong claims 
         <line/>which the affectionate people among whom he 
         <line/>presently labours have to continuance of his 
         <line/>services, and his unfitness, as he alleges, for a 
         <line/>charge so laborious; a result which, we learn, has 
         <line/>caused among the members of Broughton-Place 
         <line/>extreme and general regret.

            <small_caps>Leith.</small_caps>–Mr Cooke has generously handed over 
         <line/>to the Provost, for the benefit of the Destitute 
         <line/>Sick Society, the handsome sum of &#x163;15; being 
         <line/>the free proceeds of Friday evening's entertain<sh/>

            <small_caps>Captain Ross' Discoveries.</small_caps>–Extracts from 
         <line/>Captain Ross' despatches have been published in 
         <line/>a Parliamentary paper. From the map which 
         <line/>accompanies the paper, we gain a more distinct 
         <line/>idea of his track than the previous article copied 
         <line/>from the <i>Athenean[?]</i> afforded. South Victoria 
         <line/>Land, which he discovered, extends in latitude 
         <line/>from 70 1/2 south to 79, how much farther is un<sh/>
         
         <line/>known; and in longitude its eastern coast lies 
         <line/>between 163 and 171. Its position is directly 
         <line/>south from New Zealand, and at the distance of 
         <line/>1500 geographical miles. The length of the part 
         <line/>seen was fully 500 miles. It was girt with a bor<sh/>
         
         <line/>der of ice many miles in breadth, which rendered 
         <line/>it inaccessible. The passage southward was closed 
         <line/>at latitude 78 by a barrier of ice 150 feet high, 
         <line/>which was traced for 300 miles east from Victoria 
         <line/>Land. Icebergs were encountered in numbers 
         <line/>after they passed parallel of 63, and pack ice 
         <line/>at 66. The land " rose in lofy peaks from 9000 
         <line/>to 12,000 feet in height, perfectly covered with 
         <line/>eternal snow; the <i>glaciers</i> descended from 
         <line/>near the mountain summits, <i>project many miles</i>
         
         <line/>
            <i>into the ocean,</i> and presented a perpendicular face 
         <line/>of lofty cliffs." They could not reach the main<sh/>
         
         <line/>land, but landed on an island, which they found 
         <line/>to consist of volcanic rocks. On 28th January, 
         <line/>in latitude 77 1/2, longitude 169 E., they discovered 
         <line/>a magnificent volcano, emitting smoke and flame 
         <line/>in a splendid profusion," and named it Mount 
         <line/>Erebus. An extinct one near it was named after 
         <line/>the other vessel, Mount Terror. At the distance 
         <line/>of less than half a mile from the ice cliffs which 
         <line/>barred their progress southward, they had sound<sh/>
         
         <line/>ings with 318 fathoms. These cliffs, no doubt, 
         <line/>reached the bottom, and, including the 150 feet 
         <line/>above water, <i>must have had an elevation fo 2000 feet</i>
         
         <line/>of thereabout. The observations on the dip and 
         <line/>declination induced them to place the South Mag<sh/>
         
         <line/>netic Pole in latitude 76, and east longitude 
         <line/>153; and they considered its position as well as<sh/>
         
         <line/>certained as if they had reached it, though their 
         <line/>nearest approach to it was a point 160 miles from 
         <line/>it, on the east coast of Victoria Land. The pole 
         <line/>is probably within that region, though this can<sh/>
         
         <line/>not be positively affirmed, as its western boun<sh/>
         
         <line/>dary is unknown. The highest latitude they 
         <line/>reached 78. 4. They were therefore only 12 
         <line/>degrees from the pole and about 4 degrees nearer 
         <line/>to it than Captain Weddel[?], the most successful 
         <line/>of their predecessors.

            <small_caps>The Non-intrusion Disclosures.</small_caps>–In the

            <i>Advertiser</i> of yesterday there is a letter from J. 
         <line/>M. Hog, Esq. of Newliston, and another from 
         <line/>the Rev. Dr Simpson of Kirknewton, both ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pressing their extreme surprise at the letter of 
         <line/>Mr Hamilton (which appeared in our last), and 
         <line/>strongly disclaiming all connexion with it on the

            <small_caps>Sabbath Observance–The Sweetie Case.</small_caps>
         
         <line/>–We understand that the Government of Prus<sh/>
         
         <line/>sia, thinking that the mode of keeping the Sab<sh/>
         
         <line/>bath in that country was in some respects too lax, 
         <line/>recently sent over a person to this country, to 
         <line/>learn whether our practise in Britain would not 
         <line/>furnish hints for improvement. Unluckily, the 
         <line/>very first specimens of our piety which met him 
         <line/>were the sweetie case, and that of the poor man 
         <line/>Key who was excommunicated for burying his 
         <line/>child on Sunday. These will of course figure in 
         <line/>the very front of the officer's report as the na<sh/>
         
         <line/>tural fruits of our system, and we may guess 
         <line/>what their effect will be in reconciling the Ger<sh/>
         
         <line/>mans to a stricter observance of Sunday! We 
         <line/>can, moreover, inform Butters' prosecutors, that 
         <line/>the fame of their exploits has already travelled, by 
         <line/>the aid of the Teutonic newspapers, to the utter<sh/>
         
         <line/>most parts of Germany, to the infinite amusement 
         <line/>of the Swabian farmers, the Saxon miners, and 
         <line/>the shepherds of the Riesengeberge. Key's case is 
         <line/>no doubt destined to enjoy equal celebrity.

            <small_caps>Airdrie–Anti-Corn-Law Conference.</small_caps>–

         <line/>peared for Mr Monroe, presentee to Fala, and 
         <line/>laid on the table of Presbytery a presentation 
         <line/>in his favour to the parish of Fala. It having 
         <line/>been objected that the presentation, and some 
         <line/>other papers relative thereton, bore, that Mr Mon<sh/>
         
         <line/>roe was presented merely to the parish of Fala,

            <small_caps>Splendid Meteor.</small_caps>–On Tuesday evening, 
         <line/>about eight o'clock, a meteor of unusal size and 
         <line/>splendour was witnessed in this quarter. The 
         <line/>evening was very clear, the sky being without a 
         <line/>cloud, and the moon shining brightly. Suddenly, 
         <line/>a dazzling blaze of light burst from the sky, illu<sh/>
         
         <line/>minating Benlomond and the distant hills, the 
         <line/>Curse around Craigforth, and, indeed, the earth 
         <line/>and air on every side as far as the eye could reach, 
         <line/>with all the brilliancy of noon-day. The pheno<sh/>
         
         <line/>menon appeared like a ball of fire, of an oblong 
         <line/>shape, and apparently almost twice the size of 
         <line/>the moon, having at the time somewhat of the 
         <line/>same silvery appearance as that luminary, but 
         <line/>flaming with a brilliancy so intense as almost to 
         <line/>dazzle the eyes. A tail of fire somewhat re<sh/>
         
         <line/>sembling that of a rocket, but composed of the 
         <line/>most beautifully varied colours, streamed behind 
         <line/>it for a short distance, adding much to its spen<sh/>
         
         <line/>dour, and giving the whole an appearance at once 
         <line/>singularly magnificent and sublime. Before it 
         <line/>disappeared, it assumed a red glowing appear<sh/>
         
         <line/>ance, and then burst for an instant enve<sh/>
         
         <line/>loping the earth and sky in a blaze as bright and 
         <line/>dazzling as the most vivid lightning. It appeared 
         <line/>to pass from the south to the north, inclining to<sh/>
         
         <line/>wards the earth. To the eye it seemed to burst 
         <line/>and disappeared above Gargunnock. Another me<sh/>
         
         <line/>teor of the same kind, but much less in size, 
         <line/>brilliancy, and splendour, was observed falling in 
         <line/>a quartr rather farther to the south, a few mi<sh/>
         
         <line/>nutes previously. It is a coincidence worthy of 
         <line/>notice, that a meteor, of the same nature with 
         <line/>that first described in the above, was seen at the 
         <line/>same hour in Glasgow.–<i>Stirly Journal.</i>

         <line/>Hamilton to Bothwell, he heard the screams of a 
         <line/>female, and on looking towards the place whence 
         <line/>the cries came, he perceived a stout Irishman be<sh/>
         
         <line/>labouring a woman in a most unmerciful style. 
         <line/>No sooner did he observe this, than he rode up to 
         <line/>the scene of cruelty, dismounted from his horse, 
         <line/>knocked the savage down, rescued the woman, 
         <line/>and sent her home rejoicing, with more money in 
         <line/>her pocket than it may have been her lot to possess 
         <line/>for a long time. When we recollect that his

         <line/>Princes Street, for the purpose of presenting him 
         <line/>with a testimonial of their esteem, subscribed for 
         <line/>by the members of the Celtic Lodge, and other

         <line/>ties of their guest which had endeared him to

         <line/>name of the subscribers, a very elegant and

         <line/>in the usual amount of revenue. This simple

         <line/>a full and public exposure of these matters will 
         <line/>soon be submitted to the creditors. The Council

            <small_caps>The Church Question.</small_caps>–Long ago, Dr Chal<sh/>
         
         <line/>mers let out the secret of the clerical movement, 
         <line/>by declaring that very little of Non-intrustion 
         <line/>would satisfy him and his friends, provided the 
         <line/>independent power of the Church were secured. 
         <line/>Now, this <i>liberum arbitrium</i> does nothing at all 
         <line/>for Non-intrusion; but it does a great deal for 
         <line/>Church Independence. It confers no privilege on 
         <line/>the laity; but it adds immeasurably to the power 
         <line/>of the clergy. It is, in fact, the very worst part 
         <line/>of the claims that have been advanced by the 
         <line/>Church; and its effects would simply be to sacri<sh/>
         
         <line/>fice the lay Non-intrusionists on the one hand, 
         <line/>and clerical Moderates on the other. It

         <line/>and the right of patronage being vested in the 
         <line/>Heritors and Kirk-Session, the election might be 
         <line/>considered a popular one. About 150 voters at<sh/>

            <small_caps>Destructive Fire.</small_caps>–About three o'clock on 
         <line/>the morning of the 25th curt., an alarm of fire 
         <line/>was given at Balmangan Mill, in the parish of 
         <line/>Rerwick. The premises are occupied by Mr 
         <line/>Kissock, and despite the great exertions of him<sh/>
         
         <line/>self, servants and neighbours, the work of de<sh/>
         
         <line/>struction proceeded with a degree of rapidity 
         <line/>that rendered it impossible to save a single arti<sh/>
         
         <line/>cle. The flames in their fury having charred the 
         <line/>rafters, the roof fell in with a loud crash; and, 
         <line/>before long, the entire mill, with the exception 
         <line/>of the side walls, became an unbroken mass of 
         <line/>ruins. The building contained a considerable 
         <line/>quantity of grain and oatmeal, the property of 
         <line/>the tacksman, all of which was unforunately de<sh/>
         
         <line/>stroyed. As the premises were found quite safe 
         <line/>a very few hours previously, suspicion of incen<sh/>
         
         <line/>diarism have naturally arisen, but no clue thus 
         <line/>far has been found attaching guilt to a single in<sh/>
         
         <line/>dividual. The fire, if wilful, implies the blackest 
         <line/>malice, and it is sad to think that any one could 
         <line/>have been so wicked as to destroy what thousands 
         <line/>are in want of, and would gladly toil for, if they 
         <line/>only knew how–daily bread–<i>Dumfries Courier.</i>

            <small_caps>Hamilton.</small_caps>–Some influential persons in Ha<sh/>
         
         <line/>milton and the neighbourhood have subscrib<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed to build an Episcopal chapel in that town. 
         <line/>We have been informed that all the requisite 
         <line/>arrangements have been made for carrying 
         <line/>the views of the subscribers into effect. This 
         <line/>is one effect of the conduct of the rebellious 
         <line/>majority of the General Assembly. Many of 
         <line/>thsoe now friendly to the scheme, never dreamed 
         <line/>of espousing Episcopacy, till they have been 
         <line/>driven in disgust from the Church of their fathers, 
         <line/>by the conduct of their ministers; men who exist 
         <line/>in their offices by law, and yet set that very 
         <line/>law at defiance, in virtue of which they hold offices, 
         <line/>and draw their "temporalities," as they cantingly

         <line/>The <i>Falkland Islands</i> have been nominally a 
         <line/>British colony for some years; but, in conse<sh/>
         
         <line/>quence of representations made to Government by 
         <line/>various persons interested in the trade to the South 
         <line/>Seas, a plan has at least been drawn up for esta<sh/>
         
         <line/>blishing a body of settlers in these islands. It 
         <line/>was submitted to the late Ministers, who referred 
         <line/>it to the Commissioners of Emigration and the 
         <line/>Lords of the Admiralty, by both of whom it was 
         <line/>approved. Rules were prepared by the Com<sh/>
         
         <line/>missioners of Emigration ; a vote of &#x163;3750 was 
         <line/>put into the estimates for the first year's ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>pense, and, we suppose, passed. If steps have 
         <line/>not been taken already to send out emigrants, we 
         <line/>presume they will be taken about the beginning 
         <line/>of next winter, which is their summer. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>These islands are about 300 miles from the 
         <line/>south extremity of the American continent, in a 
         <line/>latitude corresponding with that of London. 
         <line/>Their climate, however, very closely resembles 
         <line/>that of Shetland. They have cold summers and 
         <line/>mild winters. Snow seldom lies in them; but 
         <line/>owing to their humidity and want of sunshine, 
         <line/>and the stormy winds which blow almost con<sh/>
         
         <line/>stantly, wheat of barley could not be raised in 
         <line/>them, and even oats might turn out to be a pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>carious crop. It is doubted also if wood will 
         <line/>grow, and at present there is not a single tree in 
         <line/>the islands. Turnips and potatoes succeed well, 
         <line/>and there is an abundance of good grass, upon which 
         <line/>some thousands of black cattle, horses, and hogs, 
         <line/>thrive in the wild state, and sheep have been in<sh/>
         
         <line/>troduced and found to do well. Extensive peat<sh/>
         
         <line/>bogs exist, which will afford a sufficient supply of 
         <line/>fuel. The present population consists of twenty<sh/>
         
         <line/> five persons, young and old–one-half of them 
         <line/>British, the other Gauchos, South American In<sh/>
         
         <line/>dians of a semi-civilised description. They are 
         <line/>all stationed at Port-Louis, a fine natural har<sh/>
         
         <line/>bour, where a British officer resides. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The islands are numerous, but all very small 
         <line/>except two, whose area is estimated at 13,000 
         <line/>square miles, or nearly half the extent of Scot<sh/>
         
         <line/>land. They are deeply perforated by arms of the 
         <line/>sea, and probably afford a greater number of fine 
         <line/>natural harbours than any country of equal ex<sh/>
         
         <line/>tent in the world. Their shores afford excellent 
         <line/>fish of many kinds, and seals are exceedingly 
         <line/>numerous. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The great object in establishing a colony here 
         <line/>is to provide a harbour of refuge and place of re<sh/>
         
         <line/>fitment for our ships frequenting the South Seas, 
         <line/>which are yearly increasing in number. Every 
         <line/>vessel going to the Pacific Ocean, or coming from 
         <line/>it, passes within sight of these islands, or near 
         <line/>them. At present 60 or 70 British ships pass 
         <line/>these islands annually coming from Chili or Peru, 
         <line/>and 20 more engaged in the whale fishery. The 
         <line/>trade to New South Wales employs 236 vessels, 
         <line/>most of which return to England by this route, 
         <line/>which will also be preferred by vessels trading to 
         <line/>New Zealand, Van Diemen's Land, Port Philip, 
         <line/>and probably South Australia. From Sydney or 
         <line/>Hort Town the distance is nearly the same by 
         <line/>Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope, but the 
         <line/>prevalence of westerly winds in the parallel be<sh/>
         
         <line/>yond the 30th, renders the latter route the more 
         <line/>advantageous on the outward voyage, and the 
         <line/>former on the return. The Falkland Islands are 
         <line/>about half as distant from Britain as New South 
         <line/>Wales. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Emigration Board recommend that Govern<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment should send out two surveyors to select an 
         <line/>eligible site for a town, and to lay out the land in 
         <line/>blocks of half a square mile, which may be subdivid<sh/>
         
         <line/>ed. It is proposed to sell the land to emigrants at 
         <line/>12s. per acre, and to expend part of the money in 
         <line/>carrying out additional settlers, part in defraying 
         <line/>the colonial outlay. There are 40,000 wild cattle in 
         <line/>the largest island, the privilege of shooting which, 
         <line/>or catching and taming them, might be sold to 
         <line/>the settlers or a company. The climate is unin<sh/>
         
         <line/>viting, but there is little doubt that persons ac<sh/>
         
         <line/>customed to grazing or sheep farming, or to seal<sh/>
         
         <line/> hunting, or deep-sea fishery, might drive a profit<sh/>
         
         <line/>able trade here. A vast number of ships, making 
         <line/>long voyages, American, French, Dutch, as well 
         <line/>as British, pass the islands, and to these it would 
         <line/>be a great accommodation to find supplies of pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>visions and the means of refitting here. Some of 
         <line/>our starving population in the North of Scotland 
         <line/>or the Islands, might better their circumstances 
         <line/>by removing to the Falkland Islands.

         <line/>(<i>From the Morning Chronicle.</i>) 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The dinner given on Saturday by the New Zea<sh/>
         
         <line/>land Company to Lord John Russell will serve to re<sh/>
         
         <line/>move all apprehensions, if any are yet entertained, 
         <line/>with regard to the relations between that colony and 
         <line/>the Government of the parent state. Many of the first 
         <line/>names in the country honoured this splendid banquet 
         <line/>by their presence ; and men of all parties, Tories, 
         <line/>Whigs, and Radicals, appeared to be actuated only 
         <line/>by one common feeling. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The public are now tolerably familiar with the 
         <line/>natural advantages of New Zealand, which appears 
         <line/>destined to be in the Souther Ocean what Great 
         <line/>Britain is in the Northern. Lord Ashburton, with 
         <line/>must felicity, observed, " that the position of the New 
         <line/>Zealand islands on the map, their climate, fertility, 
         <line/>abundant harbours surrounded with the seas most 
         <line/>suited to the whale fisheries, and, above all, the 
         <line/>character to the native population, led him to antici<sh/>
         
         <line/>pate that these islands were likely to become the 
         <line/>great seat of wealth and naval power." Lord John 
         <line/>Russell was justly complimented, on all hands, for 
         <line/>adding these important islands to the great colonial 
         <line/>empire of this country. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The speech of Lord John Russell was much and 
         <line/>deservedly applauded. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"I believe," said his lordship, "that the foundation 
         <line/>of this colony of New Zealand will tend to the honour 
         <line/>and dignity of the Crow, and will tend to the pros<sh/>
         
         <line/>perity and future greatness of the nation (cheers). It 
         <line/>was on this ground, and for these reasons, that I lent 
         <line/>my humble efforts in support of those exertions that 
         <line/>had been made, and were about to be made, by the 
         <line/>New Zealand Company. Gentlemen, in so doing, I 
         <line/>should be unworthy of your approbation if I took 
         <line/>any extraordinary merit to myself ; for, in the 
         <line/>first place, the principle of colonization, the value of 
         <line/>colonies to this country, the means they afford of aug<sh/>
         
         <line/>menting her strength, of adding to her power, of pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>moting her wealth, and of increasing her prosperity– 
         <line/>all this has been ascertained and demonstrated by the 
         <line/>enlightened discussions of past years (hear, hear). With 
         <line/>regard to the best mode of colonization, likewise, we 
         <line/>have had the advantage and assistance of the most en<sh/>
         <line/>lightened opinions, and the most adverse discussion 
         <line/>I, therefore, can only take to myself the merit of not 
         <line/>being blind to the importance and value of those opi<sh/>
         <line/>nions and discussions (hear, and cheers)"
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>But though his lordship speaks thus humbly of his 
         <line/>own merits, in recommending the adoption of these 
         <line/>islands by the Crown, it was perfectly well understood 
         <line/>by all present that, for his conduct with respect to 
         <line/>his colony, he has truly entitled himself to the grati<sh/>
         
         <line/>tude of his country. Lord Ashburton only paid him 
         <line/>a deserved tribute when he complimented him for the 
         <line/>sagacity with which he had appreciated the import<sh/>
         
         <line/>ance of these islands, so soon as he had entered on the 
         <line/>administration of colonial affairs, and for the judicious 
         <line/>measure of setting up the British flag in them. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We may observe that the health of her Majesty's 
         <line/>Ministers, proposed by Mr Hutt, M.P., was received 
         <line/>with loud and universal cheering, and that Mr La<sh/>
         
         <line/>bouchere's speech, which was a very good one, was 
         <line/>well received. Upon the whole, Lord John's visit to 
         <line/>the City on this occasion is calculated to gain the 
         <line/>Government favour among the commercial classes.

         <line/>There is something curious in the preference 
         <line/>which the emigrants from England, Scotland, and 
         <line/>Ireland display for different localities. The pro<sh/>
         
         <line/>portions emigrating the countries below are as 
         <line/>follows:– 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>
            <small_caps>Emigrants</small_caps>
         
         <line/>English Per cent. Scottish Per cent. Irish Per Cent. 
         <line/>To United States, 54, 14 1/2, 12 
         <line/>– Sydney, 17, 21 1/2, 7 
         <line/>– Canada, 8 1/2, 25, 50 
         <line/>– Port-Philip, 8, 14, 7 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>As the table expressly bears to be " a return of 
         <line/>the persons who have <i>emigrated</i>," we can scarcely 
         <line/>suppose that it includes persons who went out to 
         <line/>the countries mentioned on business, without any 
         <line/>intention of settling. In the report for Canada, 
         <line/>the number who went to the United States in 
         <line/>1841, is stated to be only 32,500, or about two<sh/>
         
         <line/> thirds of what stands in the above table. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It will be observed, that not a single emigrant 
         <line/>to India or Ceylon appears in the table; yet sure<sh/>
         
         <line/>ly some persons go with the express view of re<sh/>
         
         <line/>maining in these countries. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The number of person who were enabled to 
         <line/>emigrate in 1841 by means of bounties payable in 
         <line/>the colonies, was, for New South Wales 22,752, 
         <line/>for Van Diemen's Land 331. It must be remem<sh/>
         
         <line/>bered that New South Wales includes Port<sh/>
         
         <line/> Philip. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>There are returns of land sold, but not in a 
         <line/>very perfect form. In Canada, in the year 1839, 
         <line/>1840, and 1841, the lands sold were 176,518 acres. 
         <line/>The average price was 3s. to 3s. 8d. in Lower, and 
         <line/>12s. to 13s. in Upper Canada; the lands granted 
         <line/>without sale were 194,000 acres, exclusive of those 
         <line/>for Lower Canada in 1841. In Nova Scotia, New 
         <line/>Brunswick, and Cape Breton, about 200,000 acres 
         <line/>have been sold at prices varying from 2s. 3d. to 
         <line/>3s. 8d. The lands granted are inconsiderable. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At the Cape, 129,000 acres have been sold in the 
         <line/>three years, at prices from 2s. 5d. to 3s. 3d.

            <small_caps>Lands sold in New South Wales</small_caps>
         
         <line/>Acres. Average Price. 
         <line/>Sydney District–1839, 234,272, 8s 2 1/2d. 
         <line/>1840, 105,900, 18s. 8 1/2d.

         <line/>Port-Philip–1839, 38,343 36s. 6 1/2d. 
         <line/>1840, 83,687, 51s. 11 3/4d. 
         <line/>(Six months)–, 53,733, 20s. 0d. 
         <line/>531,930 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The sales were chiefly by auction. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In Van Diemen's Land, the sales in 1839, 1840, 
         <line/>were about 130,000 acres, at 10s. or 11s.; in West<sh/>
         
         <line/>ern Australia (Swan River), in 1839, 1840, 1841, 
         <line/>the sales were 71,000 acres, from 6s. 1d. to 11s.; in 
         <line/>South Australia, 55,000 acres, at 20s. The sales 
         <line/>of land are no bad index of the progress of the 
         <line/>colonies in capital and cultivation; and, accord<sh/>
         
         <line/>ing to this criterion, it will be seen, that those 
         <line/>which were advancing most rapidly in the three 
         <line/>years, were Sydney and Port-Philip. The money 
         <line/>received in payment of land in these two colonies 
         <line/>in 1839 and 1840, amounted to &#x163;307,647; and, if 
         <line/>we understand the report correctly, the whole of 
         <line/>this sum is applicable to emigration, that is, to 
         <line/>defraying the expense of carrying out emigrants. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The 118,592 emigrants probably carried with 
         <line/>them, or expended on their passage, twenty 
         <line/>pounds each; and thus the money which left the 
         <line/>country must have amounted to upwards of two 
         <line/>millions. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>This gigantic emigration one of the things 
         <line/>which convey an idea of the immense resources of 
         <line/>Britain. The United Kingdom contains only the 
         <line/>ninth part of the population of Europe; and we 
         <line/>believe it may be safely said, that all the other 
         <line/>eight parts do not send out half the number of 
         <line/>emigrants annually which are sent by the British 
         <line/>Isles alone.

      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Company was established and incorporated 
         <line/>(and is now in full operation) to carry out in Aus<sh/>
         
         <line/>tralia a principle which has been acted on with great 
         <line/>success elsewhere, namely, that of taking up money 
         <line/>in this country, at a moderate rate of interest, on 
         <line/>the credit of a large invested capital, and laying it 
         <line/>out on undoubted freehold security, at a higher rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Company is now prepared to grant transferable 
         <line/>notes, under the Corporation seal, to persons desirous 
         <line/>of advancing Money to the Company on loan. The 
         <line/>notes will be for &#x163;100 each, or any larger sum desired 
         <line/>by the lender, and will be made payable at any period 
         <line/>which may be agreed upon, not being shorter than 
         <line/>two years. The notes will bear interest at the rate 
         <line/>of five per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly (on 
         <line/>the 15th January and 15th July), on the production 
         <line/>of the half-yearly vouchers, which will be annexed 
         <line/>to each note: these vouchers, or coupons, will render 
         <line/>it unnecessary for the holder of a note to present the 
         <line/>note itself until the principal becomes due. The 
         <line/>form of note has been preferred to that of bond, as 
         <line/>admitting of transfer without expense or trouble, 
         <line/>whilst it affords equal security to the holder. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Colonial Board has been established in Syd<sh/>
         
         <line/>ney, and the operation of the Company are at pre<sh/>
         
         <line/>sent confined to New South Wales. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Security being the first object of the Company, all 
         <line/>the arrangements have been framed with the view to 
         <line/>attain that end. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Loans are made at a fixed interest of 10 per 
         <line/>cent, although the current rate is much higher. 
         <line/>The land mortgaged (exclusive of collateral se<sh/>
         
         <line/>curity) must not be of less value than double 
         <line/>the amount of the loan. 
         <line/>The non-payment of interest on the day it be<sh/>
         
         <line/>comes due, subjects the mortgager to 2 1/2 per 
         <line/>cent, additional interest for the period in ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rear; and all parties in default for ten days 
         <line/>are to be proceeded against the Solicitor of 
         <line/>the Company "without further instructions"
         <line/>and "without distinction or exception of any 
         <line/>person whatever."
         <line/>The Colonial Board only draws on the Company, 
         <line/>as loans are agreed on; their bills must be ad<sh/>
         
         <line/>vertised for public competition and the pur<sh/>
         
         <line/>chasers pay the amount, in exchange for the 
         <line/>Bill, to the Bank of Australasia (the Capital 
         <line/>of which is &#x163;1,200,00) to the credit of the 
         <line/>Company, to be drawn out by checks of 
         <line/>the Colonial Board in favour of the borrow<sh/>
         
         <line/>ers as the mortgages are completed. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The high character of the members of the Colonial 
         <line/>Board, affords the fullest assurance that these ar<sh/>
         
         <line/>rangements will be strictly adhered to in spirit as 
         <line/>well as in form; no difficulty has been experienced 
         <line/>in investing the full monthly amount sanctioned by 
         <line/>the instructions of the Court of Directors: indeed the 
         <line/>Chairman of the Colonial Board states that "he does 
         <line/>not entertain the smallest doubt of a safe investment 
         <line/>of all the funds which may be placed at the disposal 
         <line/>of the Colonial Board."
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The high rate of interest in Australia, has at<sh/>
         
         <line/>tracted much private capital from this country to be 
         <line/>invested in mortgages. These investments have 
         <line/>been made through the agency of individuals or mer<sh/>
         
         <line/>cantile firms, and therefore subject to contingencies 
         <line/>from which the Company is exempt. To those who 
         <line/>may desire to make such investments, it must be ob<sh/>
         
         <line/>vois that the stock of the Company presents a much 
         <line/>superior security, and the prospect of a greatly in<sh/>
         
         <line/>creased return, inasmuch as the Company derives a 
         <line/>large profit by lending at 10 per cent in Australia, 
         <line/>the money borrowed here at half that rate. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is equally clear that those who merely seek tem<sh/>
         
         <line/>porary employment for their money without becoming 
         <line/>shareholders, cannot have a better security than the 
         <line/>Promissory Notes of the Company, for the due pay<sh/>
         
         <line/>ment of which, the whole capital of the Company, 
         <line/>as well as the mortgages on which the money is laid 
         <line/>out, stand pledged. Every shareholder is required 
         <line/>to execute in a Deed of Covenant, by which he becomes 
         <line/>bound to pay to the full amount of his shares, and the 
         <line/>Charter supplies Creditors with the utmost facility 
         <line/>in enforcing demands against the Company. When 
         <line/>it is considered that the funds of the Company 
         <line/>here are kept in Government Securities and no 
         <line/>money lent in Australia, except on the best mort<sh/>
         
         <line/>gages on land, with collateral security in addition, 
         <line/>it may be fairly asserted, that in many respects the 
         <line/>Promissory Notes are entitled to a decided prefe<sh/>
         
         <line/>rence over mortgages in this country, which gene<sh/>
         
         <line/>rally bear one per cent. less interest than that paid 
         <line/>by the Company. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Charter provides that the sums borrowed 
         <line/>shall not exceed four times the amount of capital 
         <line/>paid up.

         <column/>
         <line/>Yesterday forenoon arrived at <mention city="Portsmouth" country="United Kingdom"
               province="England">Spithead</mention>, the 
         <line/>Lord Dorcester merchantman, Edward Howe, 
         <line/>master, bound from <mention city="Halifax" country="Canada" province="Nova Scotia"
               >Halifax</mention> for <mention city="London" country="United Kingdom"
               province="England">London</mention>. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>In this ship came six <mention keyword="Native Americans">Cherokee</mention> Chiefs,
            of the 
         <line/>first rank, one of them born in England. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>As soon as their arrival was announced in form, 
         <line/>Sir Andrew Douglas, Commander of the Alcide, 
         <line/>of 74 guns, sent his barge to bring them ashore 
         <line/>to Portsmouth; and, upon landing, they went to 
         <line/>Bradley's, the crown Inn.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The object of these Chiefs coming to this coun<sh/>
         <line/>try is, to endeavour to form a connection with the 
         <line/>English Government, in order to attempt the re<sh/>
         <line/>duction of <mention country="Mexico">Mexico</mention>, near which place they have 
         <line/>20,000 men in arms, and can raise 30,000 more 
         <line/>in a short time. 
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Cherokees have menaced that country for 
         <line/>these last three years, and are favoured by great 
         <line/>number of the inhabitants in the Spanish settle<sh/>
         <line/>ments; should they, therefore, procure respectable 
         <line/>assistance from England, the New World will be 
         <line/>a certain conquest, and open a source of trade and 
         <line/>wealth to this nation, that will more than com<sh/>
         <line/>pensate for the loss of America, and the expence 
         <line/>of attaining that grand object.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>These Indian Chiefs are dressed in the habit of 
         <line/>their country, with their faces painted in an ex<sh/>
         <line/>traordinary manner. They waited on Colonel 
         <line/>Trigge, of the 12th regiment of foot, and some 
         <line/>other officers of distinction. One of them, who 
         <line/>was born in England, named Bowles, speaks Eng<sh/>
         <line/>lish indifferently well, and is extremely communi<sh/>
         <line/>cative. He went over to America with his pa<sh/>
         <line/>rents, who were in the army, when a boy, and by 
         <line/>some means strayed to an Indian camp, where he 
         <line/>was most hospitably received, and afterwards rais<sh/>
         <line/>ed to the highest honours of their nation.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Cherokee Chiefs are expected in town this 
         <line/>day, to deliver their <missing type="copy blur">???</missing> to Mr. Secretary 
         <line/>Grenville.

         <line/>By the <dateline international_transport="Fanny, Captain Bryen" city="New York"
               province="New York" country="United States">Fanny, Capt. Bryen</dateline>, arrived in
            twenty 
         <line/>four days from New York, we have American 
         <line/>papers, of which we give the following important 
         <line/>intelligence:&#x2013;
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is an undoubted truth, (Strange as it may 
         <line/>appear) that the <mention name="Hector, Francisco Luis">Baron D'Carondolet</mention>,
            Governor 
         <line/>of Louisiana, and <mention name="O'Neal, Arturo">Governor O'Neal</mention>, of
            Pensaco<sh/>
         <line/>la, have opened the shores of the King of Spain, 
         <line/>in <mention province="Florida" country="United States">West-Florida</mention>, to the
               <mention keyword="Native Americans">Creeks and Cherokees</mention>, 
         <line/>and delivered them arms and ammunition in abun<sh/>
         <line/>dance, advising and stimulating them to go to 
         <line/><mention keyword="war">war</mention> against the frontier inhabitants of the United 
         <line/>States, and that quickly, that now or never was 
         <line/>the time, while the <mention country="United States">United States</mention> were
            engaged 
         <line/>with the northern tribes.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 30th of September, about midnight 
         <line/>John Buchanan's station, four miles south of <mention province="Tennessee"
               country="United States" city="Nashville">Nash</mention><sh/>
         <line/>ville,) at which sundry families had collected, and 
         <line/>fifteen gunmen) was attacked by a part of 
         <line/>Creeks and Lower Cherokees, supposed to con<sh/>
         <line/>sist of three of our hundred. Their approach 
         <line/>was suspected by the running of cattle, that had 
         <line/>taken fright at them, and upon examination, they 
         <line/>were found rapidly advancing within ten yards of 
         <line/>the gate, and from the place and distance they 
         <line/>received the first fire from the man who discover<sh/>
         <line/>ed them John M'Rocy. They immediately re<sh/>
         <line/>turned the fire, and continued a very heavy and 
         <line/>constant firing upon the station, blockhouses sur<sh/>
         <line/>rounded with a stockade for an hour, and were re<sh/>
         <line/>pulsed with considerable loss, without injuring 
         <line/>man, woman, or child, in the station.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>During the whole time of the attack, the In<sh/>
         <line/>dians were never more distant than ten yards from 
         <line/>the Block House, and often in large numbers 
         <line/>close round the lower walls, attempting to put 
         <line/>fire to it. One ascended the roof with a torch, 
         <line/>where he was shot, and falling to the ground, re<sh/>
         <line/>newed his attempts to fire the bottom logs, and 
         <line/>was killed. The Indians fired 30 balls through 
         <line/>a port hole of the over<missing type="copy blur">???</missing>ing, which lodged in 
         <line/>the roof in the circumference of the bat, and those 
         <line/>sticking in the walls on the outside are innume<sh/>
         <line/>rable.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Undoubted advices have been received that as 
         <line/>early at the 18th of September, as many as 500 
         <line/>Creeks passed the Tennessee, and the lower Chero<sh/>
         <line/>kee towns, and below, as on their way they de<sh/>
         <line/>cared to make war on Cumberland&#x2013;and that they
         <line/>were joined by about 100 Cherokees of those 
         <line/>towns.&#x2013;This must have been the party that attack<sh/>
         <line/>ed Buchanan's station. Dreadful havoc was ex<sh/>
         <line/>pected, but it is now hoped, that the check they 
         <line/>have received will induce them to return without 
         <line/>making further attempts upon that settlement.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On the 3d instant. Black's Block House on the 
         <line/>head of Crooked Creek, (a branch of Little Ri<sh/>
         <line/>ver) at which there was a serjeant's command, of 
         <line/>Cape, Crawford's company, was attacked, by sur<sh/>
         <line/>prise, about an hour and a half in the night, by 
         <line/>a party of Indians, commanded by a Cherokee of 
         <line/>Will's Town called the Tail, a brother of the 
         <line/>Bench, and Talohteske, consisting of 3 other Che<sh/>
         <line/>rokees and 5 Creeks.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>James Paul was killed in the knife, and George 
         <line/>Morse and Robert Sharp, at a fire on the outside 
         <line/>and John Shankland wounded, 3 horses were kil<sh/>
         <line/>led, and 7 taken off.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>These are the fruits of the advise of the Baron 
         <line/>D'Carrondolet and Governor O'Neal; and it is 
         <line/>due to Mr. Paton, their chief instrument, to add 
         <line/>he has well acted his part!!!
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>We hear from Fayetteville (North Carolina), 
         <line/>that on Tuesday the 23d of October last a fire 
         <line/>broke out in that town, owing to the negligence 
         <line/>of a small negro girl, which consumed about 40 
         <line/>dwelling houses and stores, and 28 buildings of 
         <line/>other descriptions.

         <line/>Our humanity was deeply affected by the dread<sh/>
         <line/>ful <mention keyword="war">carnage</mention> made by the <mention
               keyword="Native Americans">Indians</mention>. You may be 
         <line/>assured that the number of Indians did not exceed 
         <line/>1000, and that nothing saved <mention name="St. Clair, Arthur"
               dates="23 March 1737-31 August 1818">General St. Clair</mention>, 
         <line/>and the remainder of his army, but the great quan<sh/>
         <line/>tity of plunder he left to the Indians; they were 
         <line/>composed of various tribes, and three-fourths of 
         <line/>of them remained in the camp to plunder it, and to 
         <line/>take scalps, the trophies of their victory; and he 
         <line/>that got most when he returned to his nation, ac<sh/>
         <line/>quired the greatest share of glory; hence only a<sh/>
         <line/>bout 200 pursued. The loss of the Indians is un<sh/>
         <line/>der 20 killed and 30 wounded. The victory they 
         <line/>have obtained at so easy a purchase, and the riches 
         <line/>they obtained by the plunder, and the provisions 
         <line/>they found, will make them a more terrible foe 
         <line/>than ever they have been; they boast of taking an 
         <line/>amazing quantity of powder and arms, which they 
         <line/>wanted; many of them were only armed with 
         <line/>spears and hatchets, and I have no doubt but if a<sh/>
         <line/>nother expedition should be set on foot, that they 
         <line/>will be met by three times the number of Indians. 
         <line/>The indian tribes of nations who live many hun<sh/>
         <line/>dred miles back have all entered into an association, 
         <line/>and made the present war a common concern, they 
         <line/>to oppose what they call the common enemy. The 
         <line/>warriors of the different tribes so united are not 
         <line/>less than 15 or 20,000; numbers of the chiefs of 
         <line/>ten or twelve numerous nations were here last sum<sh/>
         <line/>mer. <mention name="Carleton, Guy" dates="3 September 1724-10 November 1808">Lord
               Dorchester</mention> advised them to make 
         <line/>peace, and offered his mediations; he told them he 
         <line/>was at peace with the <mention country="United States">United States</mention>, and
            could 
         <line/>give them no assistance. Their answer was, that 
         <line/>the enemy was in their country, and would not 
         <line/>make peace with them, but on term dishonourable, 
         <line/>and at the expense of their country, and that they 
         <line/>had determined to die before they would accept of 
         <line/>such terms. They felt much dissatisfied with the 
         <line/>answer they received, and departed with a full de<sh/>
         <line/>termination to defend their country with the last 
         <line/>of their blood.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>You may depend on it, that many years will e<sh/>
         <line/>lapse, and many thousand men be expended before 
         <line/>the United States will, by the present measures, 
         <line/>be able to possess the country in contest; and I 
         <line/>may also add, that I have great apprehensions, that 
         <column/>
         <line/>desolation and destruction will be the consequence 
         <line/>on the frontiers of the Ohio this winter and next 
         <line/>spring; I would to God some steps might be tak<sh/>
         <line/>en to prevent them. I have no doubt the coun<sh/>
         <line/>try might be purchased for one fiftieth part of the 
         <line/>expence already incurred by the different expedi<sh/>
         <line/>tions; the attempt to take the country from them 
         <line/>by force, is founded in unrighteousness, and ought

         <line/>weeks ago, and who gave us the following pleasing 
         <line/>interesting, and important intelligence, viz, that 
         <line/>two days before he left Cat-fish, two men arrived 
         <line/>there from Licking, who informed, that they had 
         <line/>been out with a body of 1300 volunteers on horse<sh/>
         <line/>back from <mention country="United States" province="Kentucky">Kentucky</mention>,
            under General Scott; that 
         <line/>they left Licking on the expedition a few days be<sh/>
         <line/>fore Christmas; that General Scott dispatched 
         <line/>three spies in advance, who, when they arrived a<sh/>
         <line/>bout 13 miles beyond the spot where General St. 
         <line/>Clair was defeated they discovered a large body of 
         <line/>Indians diverting and enjoying themselves with the 
         <line/>plunder they had taken, riding the bullocks, dan<sh/>
         <line/>cing, &amp;c. and appeared to be mostly drunk; that 
         <line/>on the information being given to General Scott, 
         <line/>who, with the main body, were a few miles in the 
         <line/>rear, he divided them into three divisions, advan<sh/>
         <line/>ced, and fell on the enemy by surprise; that the 
         <line/>contest was short, but victorious, on the side of the 
         <line/>volunteers, 700 of the enemy being killed on the 
         <line/>spot, all the cannon and stores in their possession 
         <line/>retaken, and the remainder of that savage body put 
         <line/>to flight; that General Scott, having lost but six 
         <line/>men, returned to Licking in triumph, with most 
         <line/>of the cattle, stores, &amp;c. leaving the cannon at 
         <line/>Fort Jefferson; that General Scott had previous<sh/>
         <line/>ly gone out with 400 men, but finding his num<sh/>
         <line/>ber was insufficient, was returning but met a body 
         <line/>of 900 volunteers when, upon joining him, he im<sh/>
         <line/>mediately proceeded in prosecution of his original 
         <line/>design which fortunately proved successful.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Our informant further adds, that he saw a 
         <line/>Kentucky newspaper of the 8th of January, at 
         <line/>Morgan Town, brought by Major Scott's expedi<sh/>
         <line/>tion, which corresponded with that given by the 
         <line/>two men at Cat Fish, and that Gen. Scott brought 
         <line/>in near 700 scalps."

         <line/>"The prospect of <mention keyword="war">peace</mention> from our frontiers, 
         <line/>seems to me to be vanished for the present; the 
         <line/>troops from this garrison have this morning re<sh/>
         <line/>turned, and the best account I can collect of the 
         <line/>expedition is as follows: viz. the troops amount<sh/>
         <line/>ing to about 1200 militia, and about 300 regulars, 
         <line/>after seventeen days march from <mention keyword="Native Americans">Miami</mention>,
            reached 
         <line/>the great Miami village, about 170 miles, with<sh/>
         <line/>out any molestation, except having a number of 
         <line/>their pack-horse stole.&#x2013;On their arrival they 
         <line/>found the village deserted, and all the valua<sh/>
         <line/>ble builder a short tarry, they proceeded to neigh<sh/>ings set on flames by the
            Indians. Af<sh/>
         <line/>bouring villages, without molestation, and def<sh/>
         <line/>troyed five of them, and a quantity of corn, com<sh/>
         <line/>puted at fifteen thousand bushels, which they 
         <line/> found buried in different places, and very large 
         <line/>quantities of vegetables of every kind. The fir<missing type="copy blur">st</missing>
         
         <line/>opposition that was met with, a party of about 
         <line/>150 Kentucky militia, and thirty regular troops, 
         <line/>all under the command of <mention name="Hardin, John J." dates="1 Oct 1753–1792">Col.
               Hardin</mention>, of Ken<sh/>
         <line/>tucky, were detached from the main body, lying 
         <line/>in the great Miami village, to pursue the track 
         <line/>of a party of Indians which had the day before 
         <line/>been discovered. After a pursuit of about six 
         <line/>miles, they came up with, and were attacked by 
         <line/>surprise, by a body of Indians, who were con<sh/>
         <line/>cealed in the thickets on every side of a large 
         <line/>plain; and on the first onset the militia, without 
         <line/>exchanging a single fire, made a most precipitate 
         <line/>retreat, and left the regular troops to stand the 
         <line/>whole charge of the Indians; the conflict was 
         <line/>short and bloody; the troops were soon overpower<sh/>
         <line/>ed by numbers, and all fell, except the two offi<sh/>
         <line/>ers and two or three privates, after defending 
         <line/>themselves at their bayonet points with the great<sh/>
         <line/>est possible obstinacy. <mention name="Hartshorn, Phillip">Ensign
            Hartshorn</mention>, of 
         <line/>Franklin, was one of the four that escaped, and 
         <line/>his escape appeared to depend on a more luckly 
         <line/>circumstance of falling over a log in his retreat, 
         <line/>and by that means screening himself from the eye 
         <line/>of his pursuers, that from any other circumstance. 
         <line/><mention name="Armstrong, John" dates="20 April 1755–4 February 1816">Captain
               Armstrong</mention>, who commanded the party, 
         <line/>likewise made his escape, by plunging himself in<sh/>
         <line/>to a pond or swamp, up to his neck, within two 
         <line/>hundred yards of the field of action, where he re<sh/>
         <line/>mained the whole night, as a spectator of the hor<sh/>
         <line/>rid scene of the War Dance, performed over the 
         <line/>dead and wounded bodies of the poor soldiers that 
         <line/>had fallen the preceding day, where their shrieks, 
         <line/>mixed with the horrid yells of the savages, ren<sh/>
         <line/>dered his situation shocking. After this, some 
         <line/>few skirmishes succeeded, but nothing material, 
         <line/>until the second capital action, which happened 
         <line/>two days after the army left the Miami village.
         <line/>At ten miles distance from the town, the <mention name="Harmar, Josiah "
               dates="10 November 1753-20 August 1813">Gene</mention><sh/>
         <line/>ral ordered a halt, and detached from four to five 
         <line/>hundred militia, and about sixty regular soldiers, 
         <line/>commanded by <mention name="Wyllys, John P." dates="?-22 October 1790">Major
               Wylls</mention>, all under the com<sh/>
         <line/>mand of Col. Harden, with orders to march back 
         <line/>to the town. On their first entrance into the 
         <line/>town, there appeared a small body of Indians, 
         <line/>who immediately fled at the first onset, and by 
         <line/>that means decoyed the whole body of militia, by 
         <line/>making their flight into different directions, and 
         <line/>encouraging the militia to pursue; by this means 
         <line/>the regular troops were left alone, and the Indi<sh/>
         <line/>ans had effected their design; for the moment 
         <line/>they found the small handful of regular troops de<sh/>
         <line/>tached from the main body of militia, they com<sh/>
         <line/>menced the attack with their whole force, except<sh/>
         <line/>ing the flying parties that had diverted the mili<sh/>
         <line/>tia; and although they soon found some part of 
         <line/>the militia returning on their back, pursued their 
         <line/>object of routing and destroying the troops; as 
         <column/>
         <line/>the only sure plan of success; which, after the bloody 
         <line/>conflict on each side, they effect. The regular 
         <line/>troops, all to nine, including two commissioned 
         <line/>officers, were killed and disabled, and a total de<sh/>
         <line/>feat ensued. Among the slain were Major Wylls, 
         <line/>of Hartford, and <mention name="Frothingham, Ebenezer"
               dates="14 January 1758-22 October 1790">Lieut. Frothingham</mention>, of
            Mid<sh/>
         <line/>dletown. Of the militia, it is said, about an hun<sh/>
         <line/>dred were killed, among whom were a number 
         <line/>of brave and valuable characters. The Indians, 
         <line/>it appears, from some cause, did not think it pru<sh/>
         <line/>dent to pursue their successes from the field of ac<sh/>
         <line/>tion, for most of the troops that were not killed, 
         <line/>or sorely wounded, made their escape, which they 
         <line/>never could have done had the Indians pursued 
         <line/>with their usual fury.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"Nothing can exceed the intrepidity of the 
         <line/>Indians on this occasion; the militia they appear<sh/>
         <line/>ed to despise, and with all the undautedness 
         <line/>conceivable, threw down their guns, and rushed 
         <line/>upon the bayonets of the regular soldiers; a great 
         <line/>number of them fell; but being so far superior in 
         <line/>numbers soon overpowered them, for while the 
         <line/>poor soldier had his bayonet in one Indiaman, 
         <line/>two more would sink their tomahawks in his head. 
         <line/>The defeat of our troops was complete, the dead 
         <line/>and wounded were left on the field in possession 
         <line/>of the savages.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>"No damage, of any consequence, has been 
         <line/>sustained in this part of the country from the In<sh/>
         <line/>dians; but what effect the expedition may have 
         <line/>on us, as relates to our frontier, it uncertain.&#x2013;
         <line/>If the Western Indians have any idea of treating 
         <line/>for peace, we shall be safe; if not, we are much 
         <line/>exposed."

         <line/>The <mention country="United States">American States</mention> having now gained
            their

            have been 
         <line/>regularly supplied with arms and ammunition 
         <line/>from the Spanish magazines in the West-Indies, 
         <line/>to enable them to distress the Americans, and 
         <line/>prove at least a hindrance to their growing pro<sh/>

         <line/>It may therefore be considered as almost cer<sh/>

         <line/>so speedily, that the Spanish trade must be very

         <line/>ductive beyond the calculation by which they were

         <line/>our resources, but as it assures us of a further in<sh/>
         <line/>crease of the national respectability and credit; 
         <line/>and let me add, as it bears an honourable testi<sh/>
         <line/>mony to the patriotism and integrity of the ma<sh/>

         <line/>duced to join in their hostilities, or afford them 
         <line/>a retreat for their prisoners, and plunder, they

         <line/>ons and overtures made on the part of the Unit<sh/>
         <line/>ed States, renewed their violence with fresh ala<sh/>
         <line/>crity and greater effect&#x2013;The lives of a number of 
         <line/>valuable citizens have thus been sacrificed, and 
         <line/>some of them under circumstances peculiarly

         <line/>punishing their crimes, than it is disposed to 
         <line/>respect their rights and rewards their attachments. 
         <line/>As this object could not be effected by defensive 
         <line/>measures, it became necessary to put in force the 
         <line/>act which empowers the President to call out the

         <line/>The following, it is said, are the authentic 
         <line/>particulars of <mention name="St. Clair, Arthur" dates="23 March 1737-31 August 1818"
               >General St Clair's</mention> expedition in 
         <line/>America. The <mention keyword="Native Americans">Miamis Indians</mention> had been
            for a 
         <line/>long time extremely troublesome to the Ameri<sh/>
         <line/>cans, and it was determined to drive them to the 
         <line/>back country. General St. Clair completely ac<sh/>
         <line/>complished this object; but on the 22d Oct. a 
         <line/>detachment of 400 Americans fell in with the In<sh/>
         <line/>dians on the River St. Joseph, where a severe 
         <line/>battle was fought. Many Indians were killed, 
         <line/>but the Americans lost the field; several Officers, 
         <line/>and 150 men were killed, and they were not able 
         <line/>even to bring off their wounded. This success 
         <line/>will in all probability give the Indians new cou<sh/>
         <line/>rage, and induce them again to make head a<sh/>
         <line/>gainst the American army.

         <line/>which may be had in any quantity, and may be

         <line/>I had been with a number of my acquaintance

         <line/>dler who had been scraping his cat gut several 
         <line/>hours in our service; we apparently agreed, and 
         <line/>he well pleased with the success of his persuasion, 
         <line/>went for his hat to collect what we were willing 
         <line/>to give. We took up an old newspaper, tore it 
         <line/>into small pieces, which we carefully folded and 
         <line/>put into our pockets. The tavern keeper goes 
         <line/>round the room, and we, very gravely, drop our 
         <line/>paper in his hat. The fiddler returns, and the 
         <line/>landlord with a cheerful face and an air of self ap<sh/>
         <line/>probation, boasts of what he had been doing for 
         <line/>him; "It was <i>I</i> persuaded them to make the

         <line/>and discovers the cheat&#x2013;he vents all his anger up<sh/>
         <line/>on the poor landlord's shoulders, who thus suffer<sh/>

         <line/>dous <mention keyword="weather">storm</mention> arose when she was about half way

         <line/>waggon and three horses, viz. a clergyman, the 
         <line/>owner of the waggon, with his wife and three 
         <line/>children; when the storm came on, the woman 
         <line/>and children took shelter in the waggon, but it
         <line/>continued to blow with such violence that the 
         <line/>waggon was torn out of the boat, and the body 
         <line/>having by chance got loose from the carriage, 
         <line/>and being pretty tight, floated some distance 
         <line/>till its progress was stopped by a rock; the hus<sh/>
         <line/>band, viewing the melancholy situations of his 
         <line/>wife and children, resolved to relieve or perish 
         <line/>with them, and quitting the boat swam to the

         <line/> with difficulty kept their heads above water till 
         <line/>they were relieved by a boat from the West side; 
         <line/>by this time the ferry-boat had entirely disappear<sh/>
         <line/>ed; the Clergyman just as he found the boat 
         <line/>sinking mounted his horse, one of the boatmen 
         <line/>mounted on one of the waggon horses, and by 
         <line/>this means preserved themselves till they were 
         <line/>relieved by a boat; the other boatman of the

         <line/>swimming got up an oar, but it is thought 
         <line/>he is drowned, as he has not since been heard

         <line/>free people of colour, to the amount of 700 and

         <line/><mention keyword="rebellion">exhibited an appearance of hostility highly alarm<sh/>
         <line/>ing</mention>. A deputation of five gentlemen being sent 
         <line/>from the Assembly to demand the reason of so 
         <line/>extraordinary a proceeding, the insurgents de<sh/>
         <line/>manded, that a remonstrance which they then
         <line/>delivered to the deputies, should be presented im<sh/>
         <line/>immediately to the general, and that an answer 
         <line/>thereto should be given without delay. The pa<sh/>
         <line/>per being conveyed as they desired, proved to be 
         <line/>a sensible and well written detail of the various

         <line/>On the perusal of this paper, it was judged ad<sh/>

         <line/>The circumstances of the <mention keyword="trade">trade</mention> and situation 
         <line/>of <mention>this part of North America</mention> being a matter of 
         <line/>such general conversation and great public mo<sh/>
         <line/>ment, we are particularly happy in being enabled 
         <line/>to give some further account of the transactions,
         <line/>that have happened at <mention province="British Columbia" country="Canada">Nootka Sounds</mention>, as well as
         <line/>to point out the advantages that were likely to 
         <line/>be extended to other places by the means of this 
         <line/>trade.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>It is necessary to remark that <mention keyword="fashion">the skin of the 
            <line/>sea otter is worn only in the</mention> Northern regions of 
         <line/>China. Its fur, though beautiful and magnifi<sh/>
         <line/>cent, is too heavy for the sultry atmosphere of 
         <line/>the Southern Provinces.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/><mention city="Bejing" country="China">Pekin</mention> is, therefore, the proper mart for this 
         <line/>valuable commodity, and in this immense city, 
         <line/>the consumption is so great, that the produce of 
         <line/>the voyage meets and immediate sale.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Mandarins of the Court, and even the 
         <line/>Emperor himself, are fond of wearing this costly 
         <line/>fur. To a citizen of common rank, a sea otter's 
         <line/>collar to his vestment is a luxury.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/><mention keyword="Native Americans">The natives of the North West Coast of Ame<sh/>
         <line/>erica</mention> set so great a value on <mention keyword="textiles">woollens</mention> of all kinds, 
         <line/>that all the blankets, cloths, hats, and stockings, 
         <line/>that could be procured in China, if English ma<sh/>
         <line/>nufacture, were <mention keyword="trade">sold</mention> to the Indians, with whose 
         <line/>Chiefs <mention keyword="foreign relations">treaties of commerc</mention>e had been formed.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>An act of cruelty committed by an officer of
         <line/>the Spanish Admiral Martiney's ship deserves to 
         <line/>be recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>The Spaniards discovering that Callicum, a
         <line/>Chief, second in authority at Nootka Sound, was 
         <line/><mention keyword="foreign relations">in alliance with the English</mention>, <mention keyword="crime">he was shot through
         <line/>the heart</mention> in the month of June 1789.&#x2104;The wife 
         <line/>of Callicum, with an infant child, escaped, but 
         <line/>not till wounded.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Macquilla, the Chief, first in command, re<sh/>
         <line/>tired at the head of the allies of England, from 
         <line/>Nootka Sound, and to avoid the cruelty of the 
         <line/>Spaniards, they fled to distant parts. Such of 
         <line/>the natives as they could seize, the Spaniards 
         <line/><mention keyword="slavery">condemned to work as slaves</mention> on their fortifica<sh/>
         <line/>tions.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>At this period it was in the contemplation of 
         <line/><mention keyword="Spanish Empire">the Spaniards</mention> to seize the Sandwich Islands, with 
         <line/>a view to deprive British ships of refreshments. 
         <line/>And we further add, on authority that amounts 
         <line/>nearly to demonstration, that on the very lands 
         <line/>purchased from the Nootka Chief by <mention name="Meares, John" dates="c.1756–1809">Captain 
         <line/>Mears</mention>, the Spaniards have already opened valuable 
         <line/><mention keyword="mining">mines</mention>.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>Another object of this enterprise was <mention keyword="trade">to sup<sh/>
         <line/>ply the markets</mention> of <mention country="Russia" province="Kamchatka Krai">Kamschatka</mention>, and other ports 
         <line/>belonging to the Russians, with the teas and other 
         <line/>produce of China. This promised to be an in<sh/>
         <line/>valuable channel of commerce, as the Chinese 
         <line/>have <mention keyword="embargoes">shut their ports</mention> against the Russians, who 
         <line/>
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>On this voyage of discovery and experiment, 
         <line/>one of our ships sailed and disposed of her cargo, 
         <line/>but <mention keyword="shipwreck">was unfortunately lost</mention> on her return to China.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>To these curious particulars we add, with a 
         <line/>patriot joy, that the consumption of the glorious 
         <line/>staple of England, <mention keyword="textiles">her broad cloths</mention>, is astonish<sh/>
         <line/>ingly great in <mention country="Japan">Japan</mention> and <mention country="China">China</mention>: British hard<sh/>
         <line/>ware, &amp;c. is also in great request.
      </p>
      <p>
         <line/>From the friendship of Tiara to <mention name="Meares, John" dates="c.1756–1809">Captain Mears</mention>, 
         <line/>ships which touch at the Sandwich islands may 
         <line/>depend on the utmost attention and civility. 
         <line/>This Prince is six feet 4 1/2 inches high, of propor<sh/>
         <line/>tionate bulk.
